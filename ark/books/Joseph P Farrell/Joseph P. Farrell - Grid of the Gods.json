Without them, this book simply would notexist. To them, I can only say an inadequate “thank you,” with the hope thatthey know it is accompanied by heartfelt prayers and good wishes for them, inevery thing and circumstance.I also owe thanks to my publisher, David Hatcher Childress, for taking a chanceon this book – sight unseen! – and for so generously affording me the advanceand the time to do it. Indeed, without his own personal explorations andpublications on the mysteries of ancient technology and the world grid, thisbook – again – would not have seen the light of day.Thanks must also go to my friend, Richard C. Hoagland, who many years ago sharedhis knowledge of one source utilized herein – H.S.M. Coxeter’s Regular Polytopes– in a lecture given at the United Nations. Without his willingness to share anddiscuss ideas others deem to be taboo, again, this book would not have seen thelight of day.But always and above all, my deepest gratitude goes to my co- author on thisbook, my friend and brother of so many, many years, Dr. Scott D. de Hart, indeep thanks for all the years of many stimulating conversations, many of whosecontents and subjects of discussion are reflected here, and for his undyingfriendship and persistent and consistent brotherhood and encouragement:Thank you, thrice over, my friend.Joseph P. Farrell2011 "},{"pageContent":"FOREWORDBYSCOTT D. DE HART, PH.D. Why are we here? How did we get here? Who put us here? These questions haveoccupied the minds of the greatest philosophers and theologians through theages, but they have also echoed in the minds of the most simple man or womanborn. One can safely arrive at the conclusion that if the answer had ever beeninfallibly set forward, the question would cease to be asked. Surely, it is notthat answers have not been produced, nor that some of the answers did notattract commanding audiences, but the question remains because each person bornmust ask the question again and find an answer that is personally acceptable.According to the sixteenth century French Reformer, John Calvin, “our wisdom, inso far as it ought to be deemed true and solid wisdom, consists almost entirelyof two parts: the knowledge of God and of ourselves.”1 Consequently, if it is apersonal knowledge that is to be deemed true knowledge, (or at least a fractionof true knowledge) the question will be asked over and over with the birth ofeach person. But where is one to turn for an answer?It might be thought absurd to suggest that a finite being can ever reach aninfallible answer concerning a question of this magnitude but this barrier ofhuman limitation has never hindered the best efforts of men to strive for it.The most apparent relic from this search for an answer is found in religiouspractice and belief. These two giants stand as twin pillars in a temple ofwisdom erected by previous generations of knowers. They have a voice, a message– it is not breathing though it is living and memorialized in stone, symbols,writings, and perpetually acted out within the sacred temples scattered acrossthe earth.This urge to know has long been associated with pilgrimages to sacred sites, thestudy of sacred texts, meditation or prayer in the hallowed space. Such apilgrimage is exactly what led me to Chichen Itza, a Mayan ruin in the YucatanPeninsula. On a dark and rainy day I stood in the shadow of that pyramid andliterally felt a pulse of the universe passing through my body, an eerie andforeboding energy flooded over me as I beheld the serpents and skulls staring atme, judging me, calling me to acknowledge their presence. Within the Great BallCourt with its circular stones and the winding serpent tails surrounding it, Iheard my own voice echoing across the open field, a mingling of voices from thepast making a haunting chorus and opening up a portal that is difficult todescribe. My inability to put this experience into words is the purpose of thisbook by Dr. Farrell.What is the Temple but an earthly copy of a higher idea? What is the ritual ofthat temple but the best human effort to cross over, to unite, consummate, die,and be reborn? It is the story told in the arrangement of the furniture; theplacement of the altar; the ascent of the steps; even the very geographic anddirectional positioning. Heavenly alignments are mirrored on earth andritualistically carried out by those who inherited fragments of the answers tothose eternally nagging questions. Could there have been “architects of thegods”? Is it possible that the placement, patterns, symbols and rituals, are notearthly constructions but rather sacred re-constructions that unlock the doorthat mankind has been knocking at for thousands and thousands of years? Is italso possible that a tradition exists of those “in the know” who built,symbolized, ritualized, and initiated chosen disciples to carry on the messageand pass along the sacred inheritance? The answer presented herein is aresounding yes! What happens on earth is not necessarily earthly and the ritualsof times past or present are more than re-enactments, they are portals tounderstanding.This book is not about experience, per se, but through carefully documentedresearch and detailed scholarly analysis, it will provide answers for thepilgrim and the student alike, and will raise new questions. For those familiarwith Joseph Farrell’s previous works, this volume fits in as one more piece inan intricate puzzle that few would be capable of writing. His background inhistory, theology, physics, mathematics, classical music theory, and ancientlanguages, tested in the cauldron of the oldest English speaking university inthe world (the University of Oxford) is a resume par excellence for such a work,but it is his intuitive sense of science and spirituality that sets this volumeapart as a must read.Scott D. de Hart, Ph.D.2011 Notes1 John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book 1, Chapter 1."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION “There is beauty, simplicity and power in this early technology and modernenthusiasts have mistaken the knowledge and sensitivity to natural forcesintrinsic to this technology as indicative of a positive force at work.”Michael A. Hoffman II1A. A Curious Activity Modern science is but a technique of the imagination to bring into reality theoperations of the magical intellect and the mythologies of the ancients, withconsistent and predictable regularity. This implies, therefore, that the magicalintellect encountered so often in ancient texts, myths, and monuments is, infact, the product of a decayed science, but a science nonetheless. Much ofmodern physics may be viewed as but Hermetic metaphysics with “topological”equations,2 and by a similar process of examination, much of modern genetics maybe viewed as but the myths of Sumer, Babylon, and even the Mayans, given fleshby the techniques of genetic engineering.3That said, this book is a mirror image of The Philosophers’ Stone: Alchemy andthe Secret Research for Exotic Matter, in that the previous book began with anexcursion through ancient and mediaeval alchemy in order to remain focused on atrinity of modern pursuits for an “alchemical physics.” In this book, we beginwith yet another alchemical trinity in modern times, in order to pry open themysteries and secrets of an agenda and activity of two surviving post-Cosmic Warelites in ancient times: the building of enormous temples, structures, andpyramids, all precisely located at various points all over the Earth’s surface,and in many different cultures. The question is why? Why did they do this? Whatis the real explanation? And why are so many of these structures either pyramidsof one form or another, or great circles of massive stones?The real explanation, as this book will argue, is that this activity constitutesthe coordinated effort of those post-Cosmic War elites, and that the ultimatepurpose lies in the preservation and eventual recovery of a physics and aworldview that would otherwise have been lost without such memorialization inthese monuments. This book accordingly lives in that strange world where ahidden physics interfaces with human history and with human myths, and whereeach conceptual substance within this disciplinary trinity illuminates the otherin a kind of esoteric circumincession.For that reason this book is inherently and unavoidably technical andspeculative. The reader is thrown, at the outset in chapter one, into the deepend of a very technical discussion that opens the door to some of the activitiesof these post-Cosmic War elites and their modern heirs, and to the deep physicsupon which they were based. Fortunately, the technicality diminishes ratherquickly once the point of illuminating history is revealed! So for theless-technically inclined reader, he is encouraged to bear patiently through thetechnical details, for oftentimes the physics and history devil can only be madecompletely clear by details that seemingly have nothing to do with the subjectof this book, and this is particularly true in the first chapter.In any case, it is, by anyone’s lights, a peculiar activity: the placement ofcertain types of megalithic monuments at certain places on the surface of theearth, an activity that upon close examination transcends the cultures to whomsuch activities are normally attributed. It is perforce an activity that alsorequired enormous effort and expenditure of human labor and treasure, and, aswill be seen, in some cases also implies the use of some rather extraordinarytechnology.The transcendence of this activity across times and disparate cultures thus onlyemphasizes its peculiar nature. Like it or not, we are in the presence of aunified religio-scientific “sub-culture” propping up the more tangible culturesthat allegedly produced these structures. This implies a measure of coordinationand contact, of unified purpose and activity, that transcended these cultures,and points to the hidden problems with the modern academic assumptions ofdiffusionism and the evolution of civilizations.It is one thing to maintain, for example, that certain sites in Great Britain —Stonehenge, Silbury Hill, the Avebury circles, the Rollright circle ofOxfordshire, and so on — are situated according to a discernible and definitepattern or grid upon the topography of that country. But it is quite anotherthing when that activity is also being done by Mesoamerican Mayans, or SouthAmerican “Incas,” or ancient Egyptians, or primitive Teutons, or ModernFreemasons laying out Washington, D.C. or Chinese geomancers following theprecepts of feng shui and at virtually all times in their history. The activityspans all times and transcends cultures, and yet, it is being done according tothe same basic principles, and it all appears to have been done according to a“grid” pattern of amazing complexity and global extent. Any attempt at plumbingthe depths of the entire phenomenon is therefore beyond the capabilities of anyone researcher, or any one book.It is nonetheless the commonality of activity across so many cultures, over sucha long span of time, which begs for explanation. And standard academic theories,here as elsewhere, fall short, because this common activity itself reflects acommon purpose, a purpose transcending times and cultures, and pointing tohidden players, to the activities of hidden elites, guiding the constructionsfor their own purposes, purposes that can only be discovered by noting wheresuch structures are located, by noting what the structures are, by noting themythological traditions about them and the cultures that built them, and bytaking into consideration the modern measurements of these sites and structures.As will be discovered, part of the motivation for such a vast undertaking isclearly alchemical.However, this activity is but one activity — albeit a major, if not the major,one — of those post-Cosmic War elites. Accordingly, it will perhaps be helpfulto the reader to review here the model I have assumed concerning these elites,and their other post-Cosmic War activities.B. The Wider Context of the Activity I assume, in the first instance, that there were essentially two survivingelites from that very ancient interplanetary warfare that I call “The CosmicWar,” a “good” elite, wishing to restore to humanity in its entirety thebenefits of the civilization destroyed in that War, a long and arduous process.There was also a “bad” elite, wishing to restore all the technologicalinstruments of its own hegemony, and essentially to enslave the rest of mankindby means of them, perhaps for the purposes of once again marching out into spacein an orgy of conquest.4In any case, these two elites, like the surviving Nazi and Anglo-American elitesafter World War Two, were thrust together in an uneasy post-war detente, formutual cooperation was essential if either were to survive.5 Due to thiscircumstance, when examining the traces of the putative activities of theseelites in ancient times, it more often than not is difficult to determine whichgroup is most active in a given region, if one considers only textual evidence,but as will be seen in this book, there is one profound clue that emerges from aconsideration of the Gird: human sacrifice.In the second place within this model I assume that both elites understood thevery-long term nature of their goals and commitments, and thus set into placestructures and institutions to ensure their survival and activities over aprolonged period of time. I thus assume that they endured throughout themillennia down to our own times. It is these two elites which are, in myopinion, the origin within esoteric and occult tradition of the idea of two“brotherhoods” and two paths: (1) the “white” brotherhood, emphasizing theright-hand path of love, peace, harmony, “white magic,” virtue, and tolerance,and (2) the “black” brotherhood, pursuing the left-hand path of violence, chaos,“black magic,” social engineering, and the “occult” in the standard sense,inclusive of blood sacrifices as we shall discover.Concomitant with this model is the implication that both elites know that atsome point in history this detente is destined to break down, and open strugglebetween them will resume. While this book is not the place to pursue thatdiscussion, I believe that there are distinctive signs in the last ten to twentyyears that this is taking place.In this light then, a view of some of their other post-Cosmic War activities isin order, with a view to place the grid-building activity that is the subject ofthis book into its proper and wider context. In previous works, I have outlinedand explored three other interrelated activities of these elites:> 1) In the aftermath of such a devastating Cosmic War, if there was to be a> revival of a genuinely global civilization, there had to be a revival of> commerce, carried out at great distances and between the emerging cultures of> the Earth. This could only be facilitated by an accurate system of weights and> measures capable of reproduction anywhere on Earth. This in turn could only be> achieved via the relatively stable measures provided by geodetic and> astronomical measurement itself. Thus, the first task of these elites was to> establish the methods for acquiring such measures and then to propagate them> as widely and quickly as possible;6> 2) Crucial to the re-creation of a genuinely global civilization was the> restoration of social cohesion. Here there were two problems faced by the> post-Cosmic War elites:> a) In the aftermath of the war, their population was most likely devastated> and depleted. It was accordingly necessary to expand the population base as> quickly as possible and to create a work-force capable of carrying out the> necessary projects and constructions. It is here, I believe, that we have a> partial rationalization for the genetic engineering experiments and> indications within ancient Mesopotamian (and Mayan!) texts that modern> humanity is a chimerical engineered creation, part “god” and partly whatever> pre-existent “hominid” as was available. Those texts make it clear that> mankind was created precisely as a worker-serf for the “gods,” a slave. The> difficulty was, these new creations had too much of the “gods” in them, and> thought too independently. Some method of cohesion was therefore necessary to> maintain order;> b) At this juncture I have suggested that one mechanism and technique for the> engineering of social cohesion was the introduction of religion, and in> particular, monotheistic religion requiring absolute unquestioning obedience.7> This certainly has profound implications for standard religious apologetics,> and it is best to allow professional theologians and apologists to deal with> them, but nonetheless, it is a clear implication of this type of reading of> ancient texts. Religion, on this view, becomes the principal technique of> social engineering, and, read a certain way, parallels the institutionalized> terrorism of the great revolutions in modern times, demanding unquestioned> obedience to theocratic authority on pain of death. While I have not pursued> extensive commentary on the subject, I have also suggested as well that the> institution of human sacrifice was a component not only of this program, but> also a kind of “collateralization” of humanity to certain types of monetary> policy that began to emerge in ancient times, and that this in some cases was> a component of social engineering via religion.8 As we shall see here in this> book, however, there is yet another reason for such brutal practices, and that> lies within certain conceptions the ancients held of the physical medium> itself. In other words, some aspects of religious social engineering arises> out of the nature of the physics itself;> 3) The most telltale sign, I believe, of the activities and orientations of> these two post-war elites arises in connection with ancient monetary policy> and financial structures. If the goal was to jump start civilization as> quickly as possible, not only was commerce necessary, and therewith an> accurate and reproducible system of geodetically-based weights and measures,> but a medium of exchange was also necessary to facilitate it. Here as in> modern times, two philosophies of money arose, each backed by their respective> elite:> a) Money was a receipt on the surplus goods and services, that is to say, on> the gross domestic product, of the state itself, and thus was issued by the> state debt-free as an instrument of exchange. In my opinion, this activity and> philosophy represented the policies of the “good” elite, seeking to> democratize the benefits of civilization as widely and quickly as possible. It> is a policy mirror in some cases — as we shall see — by a peculiar attitude of> some of the “gods” to the idea of sacrifice;> b) Money was monetized debt, i.e., an instrument of exchange loaned into> circulation at interest by private monopolies, thus creating a closed economic> system where there is never enough “money” in circulation to pay the interest> on the principle. This creates scarcity, and led to the most useful tool of> social engineering and private profiteering: war. In my opinion, this> financial policy and activity reflects the interests and agenda of the “bad”> elite,9 for as will also be seen, the notion of blood sacrifices and debt are> also deeply entangled.In my opinion, it is against this wider context that the grid-building activityshould be viewed. C. The Chronological Context and Layers But there is another context in which it must be viewed, and that has alreadybeen implied: the chronological one.If one examines the various megalithic and pyramidal sites across the globe, oneis immediately struck by a curious fact: the more ancient the structure — suchas the Great Pyramid, or the remains at Lake Tiahuanaco and Puma Punkhu inBolivia — the more highly engineered, and the more obvious a product of asophisticated engineering technology, it is. As one moves forward in historycloser to present times, the less skilful these structures become. Thus,situating these structures within time and cultures is very difficult, becausethis phenomenon raises difficult questions for standard academic theories andhistories: did the ancient Egyptians really build the Great Pyramid? And didthey really achieve its near perfect alignments and optical precision usingramps, logs, scaffolds, pulleys and thousands of slaves? Did the ancient Incasreally build the remains in Latin America attributed to them, walls withgigantic granite rocks with irregular cuts placed so precisely, and withoutmortar, that a sheet of paper cannot be slipped into the joints? (And again, didthey do this with ropes, logs, pulleys, and copper saws?) Did the Olmecs andMayans really have a role in the construction of Teotihuacan in Mexico? We arefairly certain they had a role in the construction of places such as ChichenItza or Tikal, but Teotihuacan? But if it was not them, then who did?A closer look at these chronological layers is even more revealing of thecomplexity of these questions, and is, additionally, necessary, for these layerswill form the basic organizational model and methodology of this essay, as wepush our way back from modern times to increasingly more ancient ones.For purposes of this book, I distinguish between three broad layers ofdevelopment:> 1) The oldest layer, which I term “megalithic” in a very broad sense, meaning> structures and sites and pre-date the rise of the ancient classical> civilizations of Egypt, Sumer, the Indus Valley, and so on. Here we are> dealing with sites of great antiquity, older than 7,000 BC. For our purposes> here, this means that sites such as Pumu Punkhu at Lake Titicaca in Bolivia,> some of the megalithic stone circles in Britain, continental Europe, and> Egypt, including the Sphinx, temples, and the two great Pyramids of Giza, are> understood to be older than the civilizations that eventually came to occupy> these sites. The reasons for this view will be advanced in the main text;> 2) the classical layer, where structures — such as the other Egyptian> pyramids, or the Mayan pyramids of Mesoamerica — are the products of the> civilizations themselves; and,> 3) a modern era, where sites are situated according to older grid locations,> an activity clearly evident in the Middle Ages with the placement of Christian> churches on or near older pagan “sacred sites”.10This broad classification is not, of course, a hard and fast rule, for as weshall see, considerable mystery surrounds some of the sites and just who reallybuilt them, such as Teotihuacan outside of Mexico City.D. The Activity of the Elite and the Meaning of the Term “Grid” in this Work One need only glance at these chronological layers and at certain ancient texts— and to take those texts seriously — to see the activity of these elites atwork behind the scenes, manipulating social policy and culture at the minimum,and, as we shall discover, attempting to manipulate the physical medium itselfby means of their surviving technologies and techniques. The activity may be glimpsed at the following account from the Aztec CodexChimalpopoca:> Well, it is told and related that many times during the life of Queztlcoatl,> sorcerers tried to ridicule him into making the human payment, into taking> human lives. But he always refused. He did not consent, because he greatly> loved his subjects, who were Toltecs. Snakes, birds, and butterflies that he> killed were what his sacrifices always were.> And it is told and related that with this he wore out the sorcerers’ patience.> So it was then that they started to ridicule him and make fun of him, the> sorcerers saying they wanted to torment Quetzlcoatl and make him run away.> And it became true. It happened.> ....> Then they tell how Quetzlcoatl departed. It was when he refused to obey the> sorcerers about making the human payment, about sacrificing humans. Then the> sorcerers deliberated among themselves, they whose names were Tezatlipoca,> Ihuimecatl, and Toltecatl. They said, “He must leave his city. We shall live> there.”11Leaving commentary on the relationship between human sacrifice and the physicsof the pyramid peoples to the main text, note what we have in this passage:> 1) A “god-king,” in this case Quetzlcoatl, who refuses to institute a certain> policy demanded by> 2) an “elite,” in this case, “sorcerers,” who then determine to> 3) depose the king and drive him from the capital, and take possession of it> and of the symbols of authority in order to institute its social policy.In other words, taken at face value, the “god-king” Quetzlcoatl represents thepublic face of a more hidden elite, and when the policies of the two come intoconflict, he must be deposed. Notably, this suggests that Quetzlcoatl representsone elite, the “white” brotherhood, while the “sorcerers” represent the other.Were it just the Aztecs saying such things, one could perhaps summarily dismissthem, save for the fact that one encounters very similar ideas in Egypt atvarious points in its mythology and history, and in the Mayan legends, and evenin a famous mediaeval Christian theologian, as we shall discover in the maintext.A final word is necessary on what the term “grid” means in the pages that nowfollow, though again, we shall defer detailed commentary on these points to themain text. The “grid,” as we shall eventually discover, embodies at least threedistinct types of numerical encoding:> 1) A “grid” based on latitude and longitude positions of ancient sites, using> as a prime meridian the line running from the north to the south pole through> the apex of the Great Pyramid at Giza;> 2) Within many if not most of these structure, there is present another “grid”> of encoding the numbers of “sacred geometry,” a science that has persisted in> the designs of cities and public places down to our own times, as exemplified> in the layout of Washington D.C., and other cities;12 and,> 3) A final “grid” directly encoding a physics that incorporates two distinct> aspects:> a) An astronomical-astrological “celestial grid” encoding the physics of the> very large, according to the alchemical and hermetic axiom “as above, so> below;” and,> b) a much less-well-known encoding, within certain megalithic structures, of> the actual coefficients of the constants of quantum mechanics, encoding the> physics of the very small.This book is thus very different than previous books on the world grid system,which tend to focus on only one of these three aspects (and as we shall see,only two of them focused on the last aspect concerning quantum mechanics). Thisbook will attempt to integrate all three forms of the grid and the structuresupon them, and where possible, the myths and legends of the cultures surroundingthem, in order to argue speculative possibilities on what all this means aboutthe physics of the pyramid peoples and the activities of the elites that createdthem.With this in mind, I also mean the term “pyramid peoples” to be taken ratherloosely and broadly, for while pyramid building was a major activity of thesepost-Cosmic War elites, it is not their only building activity, as the inclusionof Pumu Punkhu and other sites mentioned in this study would suggest. The termsimply designates the building activities of all those peoples associated withthese sites, activity that including pyramid building to be sure, but also theconstruction of numerous Stonehenge-like structures and other megalithicconstructions.A final word is necessary. This book is to be understood as yet another essaystanding in the series of books that began in The Cosmic War: InterplanetaryWarfare, Modern Physics, and Ancient Texts¸ continuing through The Philosophers’Stone: Alchemy and the Secret Research for Exotic Matter, Babylon’s Banksters:the Alchemy of High Finance, Deep Physics, and Ancient Religions, and Genes,Giants, Monsters and Men: The Surviving Elites of the Cosmic War and TheirHidden Agendas.Like all my books on ancient topics, this is a highly speculative work, though Ido my best to argue the case put forward here, namely, that when one considersthe three various kinds of encodings taking place in these structures, a complexand very advanced physics comes into view, and with it, the likelihood that oneis dealing with the elites that were legacies of a Very High and “paleoancient”Civilization. Nonetheless, it remains a speculative case.Joseph P. Farrell2011 Notes1 Michael A.

Every precaution hadtherefore been taken; calculations of his yield were checked and re-checked.Calm statements from Pentagon leaders reassured the American people, and indeed,the world population, that “Mike” would not ignite the hydrogen in theatmosphere and turn the entire planet into a funeral pyre. Newsreels of calm,confident pipe-smoking military men were prepared to announce to the world thatmankind had entered a new age, the “thermonuclear” age, an age that made theshort-lived “atomic” age seem a mere kindergarten by comparison. “Shrimp” and“Runt” were also “devices,” only in this case the euphemism was for actualdeliverable weapons, but we’ll get back to them. First, we must deal with“Mike.”Behind the scenes, the military was not, of course, being entirely truthful, andin that deception was bound all the insanity of the “thermonuclear age”. Thecommittee that had overseen “Mike’s” development, the Panda committee, had“estimated that the Mike device would yield one to ten megatons, with the remotepossibility that it might go as high as fifty to ninety megatons. The likeliestyield estimated was five megatons, the equivalent of ten billion pounds ofTNT.”2 Of course, a certain amount of latitude should perhaps be accorded thiswild margin of error; after all, mankind was firing his first “thermonucleardevice” and no one knew for certain how well and efficiently it would work, oreven if it would work, until it was actually detonated.Those estimates should nevertheless give one pause, for the military wasthrowing the thermonuclear dice. There is a great deal of difference between anexplosion of one megaton, or a “mere” two billion pounds of TNT, and one of tenmegatons — twenty billion pounds of TNT — not to mention the “outside”possibility of ninety megatons which would amount to a whopping one hundred andeighty billion pounds of TNT. The point is an important one, for the militarywould, of course, station observation ships and aircraft around the test site inthe Pacific to monitor and witness the test; how far away from the “event” wouldthey have to be stationed? How many local natives would have to be evacuatedfrom their homes? And to what distance? The military decided on the likeliestyield — five megatons — and stationed the observation ships and aircraft, andevacuated the natives, accordingly.The reason for this decision lay in “Mike’s” design itself.A. The Design of “Mike” and the Actual Test: The First “Woops!”“Mike,” like most hydrogen bombs ever since, was a “staged device,” that is, itwas actually three bombs in one: (1) a standard “atom splitting” or fission bombwhich was used to ignite (2) the second stage of the actual “atom fusion”reaction, not splitting atoms apart, but actually fusing them together, and (3)a third stage, another fission bomb to boost the yield even more. It isimportant to understand that the first two stages are essential to a workinghydrogen bomb, as the atom bomb is required as the “fuse” to achieve theenormous heat and pressures required to fuse atoms together. Thus, all hydrogenbombs are “staged devices” possessing at least the first two stages, the fissionbomb (stage one) that sets off the fusion bomb (stage two), and most hydrogenbombs are three staged fission-fusion-fission bombs simply as a matter ofefficiency, since the third stage provides the extra “kick” to make the reactionburn efficiently and to boost the yield of such devices.“Mike” was part of a two-test series codenamed “Ivy,” with the second shot beingthe test of a pure but high yield uranium atom bomb codenamed “King” with anexpected yield from four to six hundred kilotons.3 The second test was thoughtto be necessary in case the “Mike” test, for whatever reason, failed. The designof “Mike” was simplicity itself.Imagine a long cylinder several feet tall, as shown in the following photographof the actual “Mike” device. Note the man sitting in the lower right of thepicture for a comparison of scale.image [images/00004.jpg] Photo of the “Mike” Device During Construction. The Actual Device is thevertical cylindrical structure on the left. The horizontal pipes leading fromthe device to the right are the pipes for measuring radiation emissions thatwould allow scientists and engineers to determine if each stage fired, and ifso, how efficient the reaction was. image [images/00005.jpg] Simplified Schematic of a Three Stage Fission-Fusion-Fission Hydrogen Bomb firsttested in the “Mike” In order to understand this simple schematic of a hydrogen bomb, we will gothrough each of the steps of how this device actually functioned when “Mike” wasfired, describing what happened in the witch’s brew of the thermonuclearmechanics of the device. The essential thing to understand about hydrogen bombsis that the fusion reaction itself is triggered by the use of radiation itselfto drive a massive shockwave inwards around the secondary core containing thefusion fuel — in this case cryogenically cooled liquid deuterium4 — literallysqueezing and compressing it to fusion temperatures and pressures.This reveals the secret of the design on the facing page, for scientists veryearly recognized that the pressure of soft X-rays generated by the explosion ofthe primary atom bomb would not be sufficient to achieve the needed pressures todo this.5 So “Mike’s” designers first decided to surround the entire device witha foot of steel casing, which would act as a reflector for the radiation forjust the briefest fraction of a second. In addition to this, they lined theinside of this thick steel casing with a liner of lead, over which was layered afurther lining of polyethylene plastic. This polyethylene, in the instant of thedetonation of the primary atom bomb initiating the whole process, would act as aplasma generator since its atoms would be instantly turned into an ionized gas.So, while referring to the diagram on the facing page, let us now describe whathappened when “Mike” was fired, and how the design of the device itselfengineered a sequence of events that all occurred within a few millionths of asecond:> 1) 92 detonators6 around the “high explosive lenses” surrounding the spherical> fission fuel (uranium-235 and plutonium-239) represented as a ball at the top> of the diagram on the left, of the primary atom bomb are fired; image [images/00006.jpg] Simplified Schematic of a Three Stage Fission-Fusion-Fission Hydrogen Bomb firsttested in the “Mike” > 2) Each section of exploding high explosive is detonated within a fraction of> a microsecond of every other detonation, and each drives a shockwave forward,> merging with the shockwaves from all the other detonators, creating a> shockwave “front” which presses forward to the aluminum casing surrounding the> uranium and plutonium core of the primary;7 > 3) The aluminum is instantly vaporized by this compressing shockwave, which> passes through it and on to the surrounding U-235 shell of the core,> liquifying it and pushing it across a small gap between it and the plutonium> 239 core. It is important to note that in the very center of this plutonium> core there was a device called an “urchin,” a small ball of the metals> beryllium and polonium which, under intense stress (such as being> symmetrically imploded by an explosion!) will spit out a lot of “thermal” or> “fast” neutrons, the “bullets” used to split the nucleus of atoms;8 > 4) At this point, the polonium ejects alpha particles into the beryllium,> which in turn spits out approximately a half a dozen thermal neutrons for each> impacting alpha particle, which are slammed into the supercritical, i.e.,> superdense, mass of uranium 235 and plutonium 239.

Some deuterons fuse to form a> tritium nucleus — that is, a hydrogen isotope’s nucleus consisting of one> proton and two neutrons — releasing a free proton which in turn dumps its> energy into the heating mass of deuterons, with “the triton and the proton> sharing 4.03 MeV;”16 image [images/00008.jpg] Simplified Schematic of a Three Stage Fission-Fusion-Fission Hydrogen Bomb firsttested in the “Mike” > c) The third reaction that can occur is when a tritium nucleus fuses with one> of deuterium to form yet another alpha particle — a helium nucleus of two> protons and two neutrons — plus a thermal neutron that, among them, share an> energy of 17.59 MeV;17 > (We will return to the “problem” posed by this account in a moment. For the> present, it suffices to note simply that there may be a problem here.) > 9) The thermal neutron from the tritium-deuterium reaction described in point> 8)a) above has an energy of 14 MeV, and this neutron then escapes the> compressing deuterium plasma and collides with the uranium-238 “fission> booster” in the secondary, which then itself begins to fission under this> intense thermal or high energy neutron bombardment, and this of course floods> even more intense x-ray radiation into the deuterium plasma.18 In effect, this> means that the deuterium plasma is trapped “between two violent walls of heat> and pressure.”19 This creates three further reactions: > a) As neutrons are banging around in this witches’ brew, some of the deuterium> nuclei will capture them, transforming from deuterium (with one proton and one> neutron) into tritium (with one proton and two neutrons).

Those quickly decayed, to produce a swath of transuranic> species from uranium up to element 100, first isolated from that bomb debris> and named Fermium.”Swirling and boiling, glowing purplish with gamma-ionized light, the expandingfireball began to rise, becoming a burning mushroom cloud balanced on a wide,dirty stem with a curtain of water around its base that slowly fell back intothe sea. The wings of the B-36 orbiting fifteen miles from ground zero at fortythousand feet heated ninety-three degrees almost instantly. In a minute and ahalf, the enlarging fireball cloud reached 57,000 feet; in two and a halfminutes… the cloud passed 100,000 feet. The shock wave announced itself with asharp report followed by a long thunder of broken rumbling. After five minutes,the cloud splashed against the stratopause and began to spread out, its topcresting at twenty-seven miles, its stem eight miles across… … The explosion vaporized and lifted into the air some eighty million tons ofsolid material that would fall out around the world… It stripped animals andvegetation from the surrounding islands and flashed birds to cinders inmidair.23 That was not all:> Fireball measurements and subsequent radiochemistry put the Mike yield at 10.4> megatons — This, of course, is our small “problem,” for this, it will be> recalled, was almost double the most likely predicted yield for the “device;”> the scientific term for it would be: “Woops!”> — the first megaton-yield thermonuclear explosion on earth. Its neutron> density was ten million times greater than a supernova, Cowan remarks, making> it “more impressive in that respect than a star.” The Little Boy uranium gun> that destroyed Hiroshima was a thousand times less powerful. Mike’s fireball> alone would have engulfed Manhattan; its blast would have obliterated all New> York City’s five boroughs. More than 75 percent of Mike’s yield, about eight> megatons, came from the fission of the big U238 pusher around the secondary;> in that sense it was less a thermonuclear than a big, dirty fission bomb.24Our “little” problem has now grown into a monster, for where did all this extraenergy –some four to six megatons over the predicted likely yield — come from?One answer came immediately: it came simply from the efficiency of the reactionburns themselves.As we shall see, this does not really solve the problem, but rather, onlyamplifies it, for as we shall now see, the problem only became more acute in thenext series of thermonuclear “miscalculations…”B. The Designs of “Shrimp” and “Runt”: The Second and Third “Woops!”All this would not have been so bad, except for the fact that it happened again,and with a vengeance, during America’s first test of an actual deliverablehydrogen bomb, the “Castle Bravo” test of March 1, 1954, and for yet a thirdtime during the “Castle Romeo” test a few days later, on March 27, 1954. Onceagain, the bombs, when fired, ran far away from their predicted pre-test yields.As we saw in our survey of the “Mike” test, the actual device used liquid cooleddeuterium as the fusion fuel in its secondary, making the device not only large,but giving it a weight of 62 tons, making it simply impractical as a deliverableweapon of any sort. The actual reason for the test was simply to determine ifthe various stages for a hydrogen bomb could actually be engineered to work inthe sequence outlined in the previous pages. However, once the shot had proventhat the basic design principles of staged reactions were sound — never mindthat “little problem” that the actual yield almost doubled the likely predictedyield — design of a solid-fueled, deliverable weapon began in earnest, and thefirst of these, a device named “Shrimp” was detonated during the “Castle Bravo”test of March 1, 1954, the test that soon became infamous around the world.The “Shrimp” device used a mixture of lithium-6 and deuterium — lithiumdeuteride — as the main fusion fuel in its secondary. Approximately 40 percentof the lithium in in this lithium deuteride was composed of the lithium-6isotope, while the other 60 percent was composed of the more common and stablelithium-7. The problem was, the predicted yield for the device was about 6megatons, plus or minus 2 megatons. In other words, the expected yield was 4–8megatons. Yet, when it was actually detonated, the explosion quickly went out ofcontrol, and ran away to 15 megatons, almost 4 times the low end of thepredicted yield, and almost double the high end!25image [images/00009.jpg] The Castle Bravo Dry-Fueled Deliverable “Shrimp” Device, with a Human SilhouetteSuperimposed to show approximate size. Compare with the much larger “Mike”device on page 3. This “slight miscalculation” was not without its consequences and repercussions,for> The Bravo test created the worst radiological disaster in US history. Due to> failures in forecasting and analyzing weather patterns, failure to postpone> the test following unfavorable changes in the weather, and combined with the> unexpectedly high yield and the failure to conduct pre-test evacuations as a> precaution, the Marshallese Islanders on Rongelap, Ailinginae, and Utirik> atolls were blanketed with the fallout plume, as were U.S. servicemen> stationed on Rongerik.Within 15 minutes after the test radiation levels began climbing on Eneu Island,site of the test control bunker, which was supposed to be upwind from the testand thus immune to fallout. An hour after the shot the level had reached 40(Rads per hour), and personnel had to retreat from the control room to the mostheavily shielded room of the bunker until they could be rescued 11 hours later. An hour after the shot Navy ships 30 miles south of Bikini found themselvesbeing dusted with fallout with deck radiation levels rising to 5 (Rads perhour). Navy personnel were forced to retreat below decks and the ships retreatedfarther from the atoll. As the fallout drifted east U.S. evacuation efforts lagged behind the plume. AtRongerik, 133 (nautical miles) from ground zero, 28 U.S. personnel manning aweather station were evacuated on 2 March but not before receiving significantexposures. Evacuations of the 154 Marshallese Islanders only 100 (Nauticalmiles) from the shot did not begin until the morning of 3 March. Radiationsafety personnel computed that the islanders received a whole-body radiationdose of 175 rad on Rongelap, 69 rad on Ailininae, and 14 rad on Utirik.26 But that was not the end of the fallout — pun intended — from the event.> The Japanese fishing vessel Daigo Fukuryu (Fifth Lucky Dragon) was also> heavily contaminated, with the 23 crewmen receiving exposures of 300 R, one of> whom later died — apparently from complications. This incident created an> international uproar, and a diplomatic crisis with Japan.27One cannot blame the Japanese government for being more than a little angry,because the “Castle Bravo” shot meant, in effect, that it was the third timeAmerica had nuked Japan, and this time, the two countries were not even at warand the victims were innocent fishermen trying to make a living!After the dramatic and completely unexpected yield of “Castle Bravo,” a yield atthe minimum almost double of what was expected, the United States abandoned itsfire control bunkers on Bikini atoll, opting in the future for distant remotecontrol firing, and the exclusion zones around test areas was increased to570,00 square miles, or a circle 850 miles across!28image [images/00010.jpg] The Castle Bravo Test From About Fifty Miles Away, approximately two and a halfminutes after the explosion.The fireball of the “Castle Bravo” test “expanded to nearly four miles indiameter. It engulfed its 7,500 foot diagnostic pipe array all the way out tothe earth-banked instrument bunker, which barely survived. It trapped people inexperiment bunkers well outside the expected limits of its effects and menacedtask force ships far out at sea.”29 To put it mildly, the “Shrimp” bomb was arunaway monster, and left the physicists and engineers dumbfounded, even as theywere staring at their visible bones in their hands, even through theirtightly-shut and goggled eyes.While the U.S. military were scrambling to rescue the islanders and servicepersonnel endangered by the test shot, a red-faced State Department was tryingto explain the “curious results” to the angry governments of the region, not theleast of which was Japan. How could such a drastic miscalculation have happened?What had gone wrong, or from the weapons designers’ point of view, what had goneso incredibly right?The crisis had barely abated, when on March 27, 1954, the United States onceagain rolled the thermonuclear dice in the “Castle Romeo” test, and once againachieved some rather unexpected results. Its original predicted yield, prior tothe spectacular “Bravo” success (or, depending on how one wants to view it,failure), was for a yield of 4 megatons, with outside limits being 1.5 to 7megatons.30 In the wake of the “Bravo” test, however, scientists quickly revisedtheir yield predictions, and now calculated a yield of between 1.5 to 15megatons with the likely yield being 8 megatons!31 When fired, the “CastleRomeo” device, a bomb codenamed “Runt I” once again “ran away,” yielding anexplosion of 11 megatons. Of course, this fell well within the revised predictedyield, but only because the predicted yield was of such a wide margin of error,as compared with the pre-”Bravo” yield of 4 megatons with outer limits of 1.5–7megatons!Once again, our little problem has returned, the problem that began with “Mike,”and continued with “Runt I”: where was all this extra energy coming from?1. An Interesting Story More light can be shed on that question by a glance at the tables for the pre-and post-Bravo predicted yields for the Castle series of nuclear tests, forthese tables tell an interesting story.The Castle series of tests was to have consisted of eight shots, designatedBravo, Union, Yankee, Echo, Nectar, Romeo, and Koon, respectively. The followingtable gives the names of the tests, the name of the device tested, and thepre-Bravo predicted yields expected for each:Table of Pre-Bravo Predicted Yields for the Castle Series of Nuclear Tests32 image [images/00011.jpg] But in the wake of the “Bravo” success as a firing, and its failure as aninternational incident, the figures for all remaining tests were re-calculated,and an explanation for its run-away success was found, but in that explanation,a new, and terrible, mystery surfaces, as we shall see.2. The Standard Explanation for “Castle Bravo” and “Castle Romeo”It will be recalled from our previous description of the “Bravo” test’s “Shrimp”device that approximately 60 percent of the lithium mixture of the lithiumdeuteride was ordinary, stable, everyday common lithium-7. And therein lay theexplanation (at least, as far as we have been told):> The room-temperature Shrimp device used lithium enriched to 40 percent lithium> 6; it weighed a relatively portable 23,500 pounds and had been designed to fit> the bomb bay of a B-47 when it was weaponized. It was expected to yield about> five megatons, but the group at Los Alamos that had measured lithium fusion> cross sections had used a technique that missed an important fusion reaction> in lithium 7, the other 60 percent of the Shrimp lithium fuel component. “They> really didn’t know,” Harold Agnew explains, “that with lithium 7 there was an> n, 2n reaction (i.e., one neutron entering a lithium nucleus knocked two> neutrons out). They missed it entirely. That is why Shrimp went like> gangbusters.” Bravo exploded with a yield of fifteen megatons, the> largest-yield thermonuclear device the US ever tested.33Woops.Certainly the lithium-7 reactions do explain most of the reason why such aninordinately high yield was achieved, and do so within acceptable margins oferror.Or do they?Let us do a bit of detective work concerning this lithium-7 explanation. Wefirst observe that the explanation of the extra energy achieved for those testson the basis of the fusion of ordinary lithium-7 might be true in the cases ofthose tests, except for one important problem: the original H-bomb test, “Mike,”was not fueled by lithium reactions at all, but solely by the fusion ofdeuterium reactions along with the fission reactions in the primary andsecondary. Nowhere in standard thermonuclear reactions is there a reaction thatforms lithium-7 from various reactions of deuterium, either with itself or withother products within its family of reactions!34 So where did “Mike’s” extraenergy come from?We are told that the lithium-7 reaction accounted for this extra “boost” in thereaction yield, but as we have already seen, in the overwhelming case oflithium-7 reactions, the resulting products will allow only one component,tritium, to continue fusion reactions, and those reactions form a comparativelysmall percentage of normal fusion reactions.To put it bluntly, and succinctly, though it would appear that while thelithium-7 explanation accounts for most of the extra yield of these two devices,it is unlikely that it accounts for all of it. Why are we reasonably confidentof this? Because, once again, the original hydrogen bomb, “Mike,” contained nolithium-6 or lithium-7, and yet it too “ran away”! Its reactions would have beenconfined to reactions not involving lithium-7, and these would have had to haveburned very efficiently to achieve its actual yield.Some other energy source might therefore also have been in play in all thesedevices.But if so, what was it?A final and extremely important clue is afforded by careful study of thefollowing table:Table of Post-Bravo Predicted Yields, Actual Yields, and Deviations fromOriginal Predictions for the Castle Series of Nuclear Tests35 image [images/00012.jpg] Note first of all the Castle Bravo, Romeo, and Union tests. In each of thesecases, the deviation from the original predicted yields at the minimum exceeds73 percent and goes as high as a 175 percent deviation!But note also the significance of the “Castle Koon” test, the test of a devicedesigned by Lawrence Livermore Laboratories under the direct supervision of Dr.Edward Teller.36 Its revised yield was a comfortable 1.5 megatons, but instead,the device “fizzled” and failed to achieve barely any fusion reactions at all,coming in at a mere 110 kilotons.We are told that of the fizzled yield, only 10 kilotons was accounted for byfusion reactions, or about 9 percent of the total yield. The other 91 percent ofthe yield was obtained from the fission reactions of the primary and secondary.The explanation for this “fizzle” (which nonetheless managed to carve out acrater 990 feet wide and 75 feet deep!) was “an unexpectedly long time delaybetween the primary firing and the secondary ignition. Reportedly this was dueto a simple design flaw — the neutron flux from the primary had preheated thesecondary leading to poor compression.”37Of course, in the thermonuclear kettle of these witches’ brews, the slightestchange of just a few nano-millimeters of the thickness of any solid state itemwithin the device, the slightest change of positioning of various components,can — within the split-seconds’ timing of the various stages of the reaction —alter its efficiency significantly, and either enhance, or impede, the overallreaction yield. So from one point of view, this explanation has merit.But from another point of view, do any of these explanations really make sense?Are we really to believe that Los Alamos National Laboratory knew absolutelynothing about lithium-7 reactions before the “Castle Bravo” test, that it rolledthe thermonuclear dice having missed one whole component of nuclear chemistry?Are we really to believe that those reactions burned so efficiently so as toaccount — after the fact! — for a runaway bomb? And are we really to believethat Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, under Dr. Edward Teller, the “father of thehydrogen bomb” himself, could not successfully design the very bomb he iscredited with inventing?And how, after all this, does the lithium-7 explanation really work in the finalanalysis, since it would account for none of the excess yield in the very firsthydrogen bomb test, that of “Mike”?To answer these questions we have to journey to the Soviet Union, where a famousRussian astrophysicist was having similar difficulties with the sun, and fromthere, to Argentina, where a Nazi scientist knew about lithium-7 reactionsbefore the Castle Bravo test…C. The Soviet Union Encounters a “Little Problem” Too: Astrophysicist NikolaiKozyrev, the “Tsar Bomba,” and “a Little Problem” with the Sun1. Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev’s “Little Problem” with the Sun Russian astrophysicist Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev (1908–1983) was unquestionably one ofthe twentieth century’s unsung geniuses. But to appreciate why, one mustunderstand his discovery of a problem within the conventional models of stellarthermonuclear fusion. Like America’s hydrogen bomb engineers and scientists,what Dr. Kozyrev was noticing was a similar anomalous “yield” in the energystreaming from the sun and other stars:> In short, when he compared “the observed data about luminance, masses, and> sizes of stars,” the observed luminance and radioactivity could not be> adequately accounted for by the theory that stars are nothing but gigantic> hydrogen bombs in a state of perpetual detonation; the theory of thermonuclear> fusion alone was inadequate to account for the phenomenon of stars. Indeed,> Kozyrev’s analysis “brought him to a conclusion that the processes of> thermonuclear synthesis cannot serve as a main source of stellar energy.” In> other words, the fusion-gravity geometry model of standard stellar processes —> a geometric model inspired in large part by Einstein’s General Relativity and> extrapolations from it performed by other scientists — was simply not able to> account for the enormous energy pouring out of stars. Some other mechanism> altogether was at work.38In other words, Kozyrev’s stars and America’s hydrogen bombs were doing the samething: producing more energy than the standard models would allow. The onlyquestion was, why?Dr. Lavrenty Shikhobalov explains Kozyrev’s rather unorthodox answer instrikingly simple terms: Kozyrev “made a hypothesis that Time is a source ofstellar energy.”39 As I concluded elsewhere, Kozyrev had hypothesized> that the geometry of local celestial space is a determinant in the energy> output of fusion reactions, and that the latter, depending on that geometry,> will ‘gate’ now more, now less, energy into the reaction itself as a function> of that geometry. Kozyrev had, in short, surmised why the Russians — who had> no doubt encountered similar anomalous energy yields in their own hydrogen> bomb tests — were getting such strange results, results that could not be> explained on the standard theory and its methods of calculations of yields.40But what, precisely was being “gated” by the sun from these celestialgeometries?2. His Explanation: Torsion Kozyrev’s answer forms one of the major themes of this book: torsion. If timewas a source of stellar energy then, like all forms of energy, it had a definiteshape or structure, a pattern as Kozryev put it, a pattern that was, moreover,spiral and rotating in nature.41 This is exactly what torsion does to the fabricof space-time. It may be simply illustrated by an analogy that I often use todescribe it. Imagine taking an empty aluminum soda can, and wringing it in bothhands like a dishrag. This counter-rotating motion will spiral and fold andpleat the can, drawing its ends closer together. In this illustration, the canrepresents space-time itself and the spiraling is what torsion does to it.The sun thus becomes, in Kozyrev’s model, a massive torsion machine, for in therotation of its hot thermonuclear plasma, it functions as a gate, transducingthe energies of the geometry of local space, the very geometries caused by thevariations in planetary positions. Another analogy will help in understandingwhat Kozyrev is hypothesizing. If we imagine each planet as representing one ofour empty soda cans, each spiraling, folding, and pleating space-time in its ownunique way, and giving off “spiraling waves” of this energy, eventually, thesewaves will overlap in ever-changing patterns, like rocks thrown into the surfaceof a calm pond. The effect of so many torsion systems overlapping each other iscalled dynamic torsion, though there is one important difference between it andour example of rocks thrown into a calm pond, and that is that the motions ofplanets are entirely predictable, and therefore, at least theoretically, themutual influences of dynamic torsion can be predicted, with experimentalobservation being conducted to formulate the laws that would allow suchprediction.It was precisely such experimental observation that Kozyrev undertook in the1950s in the former Soviet Union, work that in 1959 caused him to be publiclydenounced in Pravda. But it was only revealed after the collapse of the SovietUnion that Kozyrev and his research had disappeared into the highest and mostsecret reaches of classification in the Communist state.> One may reasonably and logically conclude, therefore, that the 1959 Pravda> attack on Kozyrev was really a cover story to denounce his work, to> de-legitimize it to anyone in the West who may have been paying attention to> it, while Kozyrev, and his work, disappeared — as they did — into the highest> reaches of classification within the Soviet Union, for his work provided the> necessary key to understand why H-bombs were returning such anomalous yields,> yields that, moreover, most likely varied with the time of their detonation.> Kozyrev knew why: it was because the bomb itself became, for that brief> brilliant nanosecond of the initial explosion, a dimensional gateway, a> sluice-gate, opening the spillway to a hyper-dimensional cascade of torsion> into the reaction itself.42Just exactly how all that functioned will be revealed in a moment, but beforeconsidering those details, it is worth briefly mentioning what happened a meretwo years after Kozryev’s denunciation in Pravda, and the disappearance of hiswork into the extreme secrecy Soviet black projects.3. The “Tsar Bomba”: Khrushchev’s Propaganda Triumph and Its RealSignificance as an Engineering Breakthrough To demonstrate their newly-acquired thermonuclear engineering prowess, SovietPremier Nikita Khrushchev directed that the Red Air Force test the world’slargest deliverable hydrogen bomb on the island of Novaya Zemlya near the ArcticCircle on October 30, 1961. While yield estimates for this gargantuan monstervary, most place it at approximately 57 megatons — the explosive power of agigantic 114,000,000,000 pounds of TNT! — with estimated low and high ends ofthe yield being 50 megatons and 67 megatons respectively.It is perhaps not surprising that this enormous weapon was developed and testedafter Dr. Kozyrev’s disappearance into the bowels of the black projects empireof the Soviet Union a mere two years after being publicly denounced in Pravda.From the purely engineering point of view, the Tsar Bomba was a triumph, but itsenormous yield does raise the specter that perhaps the Soviet Union had learnedto apply Dr. Kozyrev’s results to its bomb-engineering, a point that we now morefully explore in connection with the little- known, and little-understood, workof a Nazi scientist working in a secret post-war project in Juan Perón’sArgentina.image [images/00013.jpg] A Dramatic Comparison of Device Yields by Mushroom Clouds, Note the Tiny Specks in the bottom left of the diagram, blown up in the circlerepresenting Hiroshima and the Trinity atom-bomb test in New Mexico of July,1945. D. The Lithium-7 Mystery, a Nazi Scientist in Argentina, and a CuriousCoincidence While Kozyrev may have been solving the yield-efficiency dilemma for the Sovietson the basis of torsion effects in rotating plasmas like the sun, a Naziscientist in Argentina may have been giving the Americans specific clues aboutthe lithium-7 reaction — and torsion effects in fusion reactions in rotatingplasmas — discoveries he claimed to have made long before the Castle Bravo test,and here we are confronted with an even greater mystery.That Nazi physicist’s name was Dr. Ronald Richter, and he stunned the world whenhis ostensible boss, Argentine President Juan Domingo Perón, announced to theworld that Argentina had successfully discovered the secret of the hydrogen bombat a press conference on April 2, 1951. Perón went on to disclose that Argentinahad achieved this feat after a mere nine months’ research!43 Perón thenintroduced Dr. Ronald Richter, the Nazi scientist heading the project, to theassembled journalists, and Richter proceeded to inform them that he knew how tocontrol thermonuclear reactions precisely. These assertions, if true, werehighly problematical, since America had not even detonated “Mike” yet, nor wouldit, until the next year on November 1, 1952! Richter, and Argentina, had beatenAmerica to the thermonuclear punch by over a year! Or so, at least, Juan Perónsaid.Needless to say, the world press, and in particular, the American media,denounced the whole affair as a fraud and roundly condemned Richter forcharlatanry, and for a very simple reason: as we have seen, it takes an atombomb to create the heat and pressures necessary to set off a hydrogen bomb, andArgentina had tested no such bomb. Therefore Richter’s story — on theconventional analysis — had to be a case of pure fraud.Confronted by this media outcry and denunciation, Perón became justifiablysuspicious of his Nazi physicist and the project that was consuming vast amountsof money, and he appointed a special commission of Argentine scientists toinvestigate it and report its findings directly back to him. Heading thiscommission was the young Argentine nuclear physicist, Dr. Jose Balseiro.It is when we consider Dr. Balseiro’s findings that the lithium-7 explanation ofthe Castle Bravo test takes on a very new, and very sinister, significance, forlithium-7 reactions were the precise reactions upon which Dr. Richter was basinghis claims!> Balseiro begins his report by observing that “the basis upon which Dr.> Richter’s experiments rest are the two known nuclear reactions> Li7 + H = 2He4 + Q3 Q=17.28 MeV> H2+H2=H3+Q+n, Q= 3.18 Mev.”> That is, in the first case, the fusion of a lithium-7 atom with a hydrogen> atom will produce two helium atoms plus an enormous quantity of> electromagnetic energy (in the form of an x-ray and gamma ray burst) of 17.28> million electron volts of energy. In the second case, the fusion of two> deuterium atoms (atoms of hydrogen with an extra neutron in the nucleus) will> produce an atom of tritium (an atom of hydrogen with two extra nuetrons in the> nucleus) plus a free neutron plus a burst of electromagnetic energy of 3.18> million electron volts.44Before proceeding any further, it is important to pause here and note exactlywhat is being said, well in advance of the Castle Bravo test and the lithium-7explanation used to explain its runaway results, for this reaction was clearlyknown and understood by an Argentine physicist, and a Nazi physicist, b e f o re the test even took place. It is thus h i g h l y unlikely that we are beingtold the truth when we are told that our scientists and engineers did not evenconsider litrhium-7 reactions in their calculations of the Castle Bravo yield.Thus, the standard lithium-7 reactions were known, making it unlikely America’sthermonuclear “theurgists” were unaware of it. Some other reaction may thereforealso have been involved, and once again, Dr. Richter in Argentina indicated thathe knew what it was, for the standard physics models simply did not work.Indeed, for Dr. Balseiro, this was the whole problem posed by Dr. Richter.Richter was claiming to have achieved fusion reactions within a lithium-7 plasmaat atmospheric pressures and under relatively “cool” conditions of pulsing itwith electrical discharges. Dr. Balseiro puts the difficulty this way:> For 1% of the nuclei to have enough energy to start the reaction, we need> therefore, an initial temperature of at least 40 millions of degrees Kelvin.> As a comparison, it is of relevance to recall that the temperature in the> hottest zone of a voltaic discharge arc does not reach higher than 4,000 K and> that the highest instantaneous temperatures reached in the laboratory by> Kapitza are of the order of 100,000 K.45But this was not the only problem, and Dr. Balseiro was honest enough to recordwhat the real problem with Dr. Richter was:> The analysis made above, shows the impossibility, according to present> knowledge, of achieving in the laboratory this type of nuclear reactions> (sic). Dr. Richter, however, claims on this point to have discovered a set of> phenomena that make invalid the type of reasoning exposed above. Furthermore,> he insists these new phenomena discovered by him, constitute the basic secret> of the process of thermonuclear reaction.It is not possible to foresee to what class of phenomena Dr. Richter refersto(sic), in particular because their existence cannot fail to contradict some ofthe basic knowledge which is accepted at present. In the first place, if the(Lithium-Hydrogen reaction) would occur at temperatures substantially below 20(thousand electron volts) this would imply a fundamental change in our presentknowledge of nuclear structure and quantum mechanics.46 There it is: Richter claimed to have discovered a very different phenomenon, oneallowing him to induce thermonuclear fusion reactions under conditions of stressand heat several orders of magnitude less extreme than that required byconventional theory.The only question is, what was it?Again, Dr. Balseiro is to be commended for his honest recording of Dr. Richter’sassertions, and here, they are quite revealing:> Dr. Richter has stated that the control device of the themonuclear device is> based on the resonance obtained between the Larmor precession frequency —> which originates in the interaction of the magnetic field acting on the> intrinsic magnetic moment of the (lithium-7) atom — and that of the> oscillating magnetic field produced by a radio frequency generator.47Let us pause and note carefully what we have by comparing Dr. Balseiro with Dr.Richter’s view.Balseiro assumes the standard model of fusion reactions is true. That is, heassumes:> 1) that fusion reactions can only occur under conditions of extreme heat and> pressure, under temperatures in excess of 40 million degrees Kelvin; and that, > 2) nothing else is involved in the reaction; and that, > 3) Lithium-7, the very reaction allegedly overlooked by the American bomb> engineers, was well known to the Argentine physicist who interviewed Richter> fully two years before the Castle Bravo test. But Dr. Richter is assuming something entirely different and upon closeexamination, much more comprehensive:> 1) The mention of the Larmor precession simply means that Dr. Richter is> thinking in terms of a rotating plasma, just as was Dr. Kozyrev; > 2) Moreover, he is also taking into account that an oscillating magnetic field> inside of a static one will contribute additional factors of stress to the> plasma, making fusion reactions possible under conditions of stress in the> plasma very different from those assumed in standard engineering, under heat> and pressures several orders of magnitude less than those assumed to be> necessary in the standard model; Richter is thinking of the sun as a model,> with its rotating plasma, and its magnetic field. He is thinking in almost> exactly the same terms as Dr. Kozyrev, and moreover, doing so before Dr.> Kozyrev. Richter is thinking in terms of torsion. It is after Richter was denounced by the Argentine commission and placed underhouse arrest by Perón that things began to get really interesting, for while theU.S.A. was busy publicly denouncing him, very quietly and it was sending AirForce officers to secretly interview him and analyze what he was saying, andthis was being done after the Castle Bravo tests and its anomalous yields. Smallwonder, for Richter explicitly stated that he was achieving fusion reactions inlithium-7 and at atmospheric pressures to boot!But what Richter told his American interrogators must have stunned them. “Weassume,” he wrote for his American visitors,> that highly compressed electron gas (i.e., a plasma, ed.) becomes a detector> for energy exchange with what we call zero point energy…in a shock-> wave-superimposed, turbulence-feed-back controlled plasma zone…(and that) on> the basis of exchange coupling, it seems to be possible to ‘extract’ a> compression- proportional amount of zero-point energy by means of a> magnetic-field-controlled exchange fluctuation between the compressed electron> gas and (a) sort of cell structure in space…48In other words, Richter is saying the exact same thing as Kozyrev: a rotatingplasma under conditions of magnetic stress and resonance will transduce energyfrom the local geometry of space-time itself, and that geometry includes theposition of a thermonuclear detonation on the surface of the earth, and the timeof the detonation, i.e., the relative position of the sun and planets.The reception of this comment by his American counterparts led to something ofan impasse within American scientific circles; some continued to denounceRichter as a fraud and a montebank… but others were not so sure, and in fact,one Atomic Energy Commission scientist stated that Richer was “a mad geniusworking in the 1970s,” decades ahead of his American counterparts.49It is the timing of this assessment — in the mid-1950s — that suggests quitestrongly that America’s interest in Richter and his explanations of lithium-7reactions was in response to the anomalous yields from the Mike and Castle BravoH-bomb tests. Richter had told them that, yes, part of the reason was thatlithium-7 had entered the chain fusion reactions, but he had also told themsomething else: the bombs were gating extra energy beyond the reactionsthemselves, energy coming into the reaction by dint of a coupled resonatoreffect between the reaction and the geometries of local space-time — whatRichter is calling a “cell-like” structure or grid structure in local space —and all by dint of the rotation of the fusion plasma. Richter was telling them,like Kozyrev in the Soviet Union, that the bombs were “torsion machines,”activating the energy of that global, and celestial, grid.E. Explanations and Transitions But why bring rotating plasmas into the description at all, since nowhere in thedescriptions of the fusion reactions of “Mike” examined previously is rotationever mentioned, and for a very important reason: there was absolutely nothingwithin the engineering of the Mike device that was designed to rotate the plasmainside a magnetic field.…or was there?Might rotation in the plasma of that bomb have been accidentally introduced, andthus with it, hidden torsion effects?The answer is a simple yes, and a closer look is in order.Look once again at the atom bomb primary at the top of our diagram of a standardhydrogen bomb.image [images/00014.jpg] It is this atom bomb that sets all else in motion, for in order for a fissionreaction to take place, the core must be symmetrically compressed in a matter ofa few thousandths of a second. But the likelihood of all the conventionalexplosives firing at exactly the same instant to achieve such symmetricalcompression is very small; there will be minute nanoseconds’ of differencebetween the firing of one set of explosives versus another, and this means thata slight asymmetry will be introduced into the shockwaves compressing the core.That asymmetry could conceivably induce vorticular, rotating structures in thecore as it burns into a plasma, and those structures in turn may be strongenough to endure into the fusion reactions in the secondary.All this, let it be remembered, takes place inside yet another rotating systemwith a magnetic field: planet Earth, a system with its own natural standingwaves and torsion effects.Richter was telling the American scientists that more was involved inthermonuclear reactions than simply the particle-nucleus reactions and extremeheat; there were hidden factors at work: factors of rotation, of magneticfields, and the placement of the device itself on the surface of the earth.These were totally unaccounted for in standard physics models and in thestandard engineering resulting from them. For a brief moment, just as he stated,a strong fusion reaction acted as a resonator, tapping into the structure ofspace-time, a structure that would perforce include the bomb’s placement on theplanet itself. Vary the position, and time, of the detonation, and the yieldwill vary.50 The reactions driving the awesome destructive power of hydrogenbombs were truly magical, alchemical acts, calling down the heavenly fire of thegods of old, the planets and the stars.Torsion may thus also explain why the Soviets tested their massive “Tsar” Bombso close to the Arctic Circle, for there, any torsion effects of the Earth’srotation would be smaller since the angular momentum of the planet at extremenorthern latitudes is much less than that closer to the equator.51In any case, in offering these explanations, Richter was really telling theAmerican scientists that there was an ancient aspect to the engineering of suchmassive weapons, an aspect dependent upon time and location. Small wonder thatthis former Nazi scientist would say such a thing, for he also told his Americaninterrogators that he made these discoveries in Nazi Germany in the year 1936!52And little wonder, too, that in addition to investigating such torsion-basedtechnologies of “thermonuclear theurgy”, that Nazi Germany was alsoinvestigating the world grid system and pursuing its own geopolitical geomancyas well…image [images/00015.jpg] Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev image [images/00016.jpg] Dr Ronald Richter Notes1 Dr Nikolai Kozyrev, “Possibility of the Experimental Study of the Propertiesof Time,” www.abyme.net [http://www.abyme.net], pp. 10–11, emphasis in theoriginal.2 Richard Rhodes, Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb (New York:Touchstone, Simon and Schuster, 1996), pp. 493–494.3 Richard Rhodes, Dark Sun, p. 487.4 Deuterium is simply the most common heavy isotope of ordinary hydrogen, withan extra neutron in the nucleus.

The coupling effect spoken of byRichter with the zero-point energy may rationalize why some UFOlogists maintainthat “ET” started showing up in high numbers after the beginnings of humannuclear testing, i.e., such tests literally sent “hyper-dimensional” pulses ofenergy through the medium itself.51 There is a school of thought, to which this author does not subscribe, thatsuggests that thermonuclear weapons are space-time harmonics weapons to such adegree that they only can be set off at certain locations and times, orotherwise they will not work.

This hedid by establishing officially, on July 1, 1935, a department called theAhnenerbedienst, the so-called “ancestral research bureau” to research ancienttexts and sites and to establish their supposed Aryan patrimony. By 1940, it hadbeen wholly absorbed by Himmler’s other notorious creation, the SS. It was, asresearcher Peter Levenda has quipped, “a humanities program. With guns.”2The Ahnenerbe Forschungs und Lehrgemeinschaft or “Ancestral Heritage Researchand Teaching Society” was but the tip of a very large iceberg of all manner ofprojects involving occult methods and practice within the Third Reich. Dowsersusing pendulums over maps were employed to successfully locate Benito Mussoliniwhen he was being held prisoner in 1943 after the collapse of his government.3The German Navy employed a “research” institute that attempted to locate Alliedships using similar methods, including dowsers, astrologers, pendulumgeomancers, naval charts, and a whole host of occult and magical techniques.According to Wilhelm Wulff, who was involved in these projects,> All intellectual, natural, and supernatural sources of power — from modern> technology to mediaeval black magic, and from the teachings of Pythagoras to> the Faustian pentagram incantation — were to be exploited in the interests of> final victory.4The Nazi Reich, in other words, was attempting literally to resurrect theancient magic, the lost science of the gods, in some cases, quite literally byinvoking them.Concomitant with this all-encompassing philosophy, all manner of esotericpractice was pursed for its potential military application. Within theAhnenerbedienst alone there were> over fifty separate sections devoted to a wide range of scientific and> pseudoscientific research… There was a Celtic studies group within the> Ahnenerbe; a group to study the Teutonic cult center at Externsteine (near> Wewelsberg), which… was believed to be the site of the famous World-Tree,> Ydragsil or Yggdrasil; a group devoted to Icelandic research (as the Eddas> were sacred to the Teuton myth…); a group that was formed around Ernst> Schäffer and his Tibet expeditions; a runic studies group; a “World Ice> Theory” division; an archaeological research group that scoured the earth for> evidence of Aryan presence in lands as remote from Germany as the Far East and> South America…5In addition to this, one does not have to dig very long to see that part of thisresearch also included serious effort to understand the “world grid,” and ifpossible, to tap into whatever sources of power it represented, from geomancy totorsion.A. The Grid and Hitler’s East Prussia Headquarters Hitler’s East Prussia headquarters, the Wolfsschanze at Rastenburg, for example,has always been something of a mystery to military historians unaccustomed toexamining the influence of esoteric systems of thought on Nazi practice. Why wasit built there, “set as it was in the swampy woodlands of Die Görlitz among theMasurianLakes of East Prussia”?6 Why build a headquarters in a wooded swamp?The answer, if one knew about the world grid and the Nazis’ obsession withanything that could confer power, was simple:> When Hitler’s engineers laid out the fortress in 1940-41, they incorporated a> civilian graveyard lying astride a ley line which ran from a high point west> of Rastenburg, through a church in the town, the church and chapel at Karlshof> near Krausendorf, a suburb of Rastenburg, through the site of the Kurhaus> itself (a high point at 137 meters above sea level), on through the graveyard> to the island of Tautenburg and thence to the village of Schwiddern. Himmler’s> headquarters in East Prussia, Hochwald, was situated in another wood twelve> miles away to the north east of the Wolfsschanze. It was linked to the Kurhaus> by another ley line which ran from Hochwald via the Kurhaus to several high> points (marked by triangulation markers) to the south-east and south-west of> the town of Rastenburg itself. In Ancient German Sanctuaries Wilhelm Teudt had> noted the coincidence of triangulation markers in his holy lines and it was> borne in mind by Himmler’s men when selecting the site of Hochwald.The occult function of the headquarters is obvious. Placing them in significantpositions according to sacred geography enabled their rulers to transmit psychicpower over the areas covered by the geomantic grid. Of these two lines, one ranalmost due east-west, whilst the other, which linked the two sites, ran towardsthe north-east in the direction of Moscow.7 But there may have been something more than just Nazi obsession with geomancyand “psychic energies” in the placement of the two leaders’ headquarters, for itshould be noted that the number 137 forms a part of the coefficient of the finestructure constant of physics, with a value of 1/137.035999679. The constant wasintroduced into quantum mechanical theory by Arnold Sommerfeldt in 1916.8image [images/00017.jpg] The Convergence of Ley Lines near Hitler’s Wolfsschanze Headquarters nearRastenburg, East Prussia. Note the Placement of the Fortress on the East-WestLine.9 B. Grid Geopolitical Geomancy Might the Nazis have found (or at least thought they had found) the means to“activate” or even tap into the physics of the alleged energies of the globalgrid system?The answer to this question is more disturbing.Official and unofficial German interest in the occult in general and geomanticsystems in particular goes back at least to the era of the Holy Roman Empire,when the secret imperial star chamber, the Heilege Vehm or “Holy Vehm’s”initiates and executioners would often meet secretly at night at various sacredgeomantic sites.10 By the time of King Frederick the Great’s Prussia, thisesoteric interest had become fully fledged. Frederick founded the AfrikanischenBauherren, or Order of Architects of Africa, centering it at his Constantinoplestructure constant to modern theoretical physics and the anthropic cosmologicalprinciple, this is the subject of another book. It should be noted that 137, thebasic coefficient of the constant, is the 33rd prime number.Lodge in Berlin.There, “its initiates studied hieroglyphics, the sciences, history andantiquities, and the Manichaean Mysteries.”11This fascination with ancientmysteries, esotericism, and knowledge was accompanied by an interesting claim,for Frederick’s Prussian Grand Lodge also asserted its continuity from anotherancient society, the World Wise Men:> This ‘White Lodge’ is the same group of hidden masters described by Madame> Blavatsky’s Theosophical Society and the German Thule Society from which many> leading Nazis came. The Prussian Freemasons claimed that these World Wise Men> were none other than the Carpocratians, a group of Christ’s disciples to whom> he communicated a secret science, transmitted afterwards to the Templars and> thence via Scotland to the Swedish Rite Freemasons… They were also> traditionally endowed with the mastery of a mysterious power drawn from the> Earth — Vril.12We note then that the idea of continuity with an ancient elite was very much apart of the Masonic tradition,13 particularly in Prussia.The peculiar connection with the Earth grid, however, is manifest in the factthat the Freemasons of Frederick the Great’s Prussia claimed this hidden elitehad the mastery of the Vril energy drawn from the Earth. These ideas of acontinuity with an ancient elite, and of Vril or Earth energy force becamecardinal principles of the ideology of the Thulegesellschaft, the Thule Society,one of the secret fraternities that helped to midwife the Nazi Party intoexistence.> The Thule society believed that by harnessing this force they could raise> Germany to an unassailable position of world domination. By 1919, the Thule> Society (which had been founded in 1912) had become a rallying-point for> Bavarian mystical anti-Semites. Anton Drexler, original leader of the German> Workers’ Party, was a member. So was Rudolf Hess, soon to become Hitler’s> right-hand man, as was Alfred Rosenberg, future philosopher of National> Socialism. This society claimed to be the instrument of the legendary ‘Secret> Chiefs’ of Tibet — descendants of the survivors of Atlantis living somewhere> in the remote Himalayas.14These hidden masters the Thule Society — like so many other fraternities thatclaimed such continuity with an ancient elite — identified with the “whiteLodge” or “White Brotherhood,”15 never bothering to consider the other assertionof esoteric tradition: that there was a black Lodge or “Brotherhood” or elite aswell, and that they might be in continuity with something whose agendas andmoral compass were quite different than what was assumed of the “White” lodgesfrom which they claimed descent.In any case, by asserting their claims to mastery over the Earth grid, the earlytwentieth century German occultists could draw on a wide tradition of Englishand German Earth grid research. Alfred Watkins had already published his nowfamous study of the grid system of England, The Old Straight Track, and thefamous astronomer, Sir Norman Lockyear, had extended the idea to includeastronomical alignments of many ancient sites, including Stonehenge and theEgyptian temples in his books Stonehenge and The Dawn of Astronomy.Not to be outdone, the Germans Josef Heinsch and Wilhelm Teudt published similarworks concerning the grid system in Central and Western Europe and the layout ofchurches and monasteries over older sacred pagan sites. Studying Stonehenge,Heinsch discovered other alignments overlooked by Lockyear, and extended hisobservations to include all of Central Europe and its ancient sites, i.e.,Germany.16> In 1933, excavations at the Choir in Xanten Cathedral in the Rhineland> revealed an ancient geometrical mosaic pavement, Heinsch was called in to> examine it. In form, it was a square crisscrossed with lines and diagonals.> Heinsch measured its angle of orientation and found it to be the same as that> of the Avenue atStonehenge — a misummer sunrise alignment. Its form echoed the> ancient cosmic diagrams of the Chinese, Mexican, and Norse cosmology. Testing> the pattern on a map of the district, he noticed that the lines of this> cosmographic mosaic correspondence with the placement of the churches in the> district. From this startling discovery, Heinsch was able to detect a major> north-south axis on the Lower Rhine just like those studied in England by> Duke, Bennett and Lockyear. He now had the key to the sacred geography of> Europe.17This, of course, was tailor-made to fit the esoteric beliefs of the ThuleSociety and the Nazis, who had assumed power that same year.image [images/00018.jpg] Sir Norman Lockyear’s Simple Triangulation of Locations Around Stonehenge18 image [images/00019.jpg] Heinsch’s Survey of the Grid System Around Stonehenge19 image [images/00020.jpg] Heinsch’s Grid Lines at Stonehenge20 Heinsch’s associate Gerlach21 extended this system into a ley line systemcovering the whole of Central Europe, i.e., Germany and southern Scandinavia,based on the placement of churches in the area.image [images/00021.jpg] Gerlach’s System of Alignments in Central Europe22 All of this work on the Earth grid by Heinsch, Teudt, and Gerlach, let it benoted, was being done in Germany in the period immediately prior to, and after,the Nazi assumption of power, which leads to the logical question: what exactlydid the Nazis do with it?With that question, the plot thickens considerably, though the clues are stillenshrouded in mystery, leaving researchers to piece them together.One clue lies in the outright esoteric nature of Nazi practice, a practice thatcan only be qualified as “geopolitical geomancy.” As the Wehrmacht swept acrossEurope and smaller nations fell either to outright occupation, or were pressuredinto alliances with the Third Reich, the SS, behind the scenes, was quietly“collecting” all manner of things. Coupled with this activity, the Gestapoinfiltrated secret fraternities, from the Freemasons to the Rosicrucians, andprepared lengthy dossiers on all of them, since they claimed “to possess certainuniversal secrets which Himmler felt could be put to better us by the SS.”23 Theinterest of these societies in Jewish Qabalistic esotericism was even held to be“a threat to state security” and “to Nazi magic itself.”24 This “magic”disclosed itself in two ways, the first being the collection of regalia:> In order to consolidate his position as future Emperor of Europe, Hitler> became an inveterate collector of regalia. At first, the regalia he presented> himself were only replicas, but after the war began in earnest, he> appropriated the authentic articles. In 1934, he obtained copies of the crown,> orb, and sceptre that had been the imperial insignia of the Holy Roman Emperor> Charlemagne. Although he had made this odd gesture on behalf of the German> people — “I accept these into my keeping on behalf of the glorious Fatherland”> — it is an indication that he actually saw himself in the role of Kaiser of> the Third Reich. As the deposed Kaiser Wilhelm II was still alive at the time,> it would not have been politic for him to proclaim himself Kaiser, but, had he> won the war, it is likely that Kaiser Adolf I would have been crowned at the> World’s Fair and victory celebrations planned for Berlin in 1950.As his conquests proceeded, Hitler continued to accumulate the trappings ofsacral kingship. Six months after the Anschluss of Germany with Austria, MayorLiebel of Nuremburg presented Hitler with more replica regalia, this time of amore overtly occult nature. When Hitler had re-entered his native land as itsmaster in 1938, he had shown an inordinate interest in certain jewels among theHapsburg regalia. These were the pieces made for the fifteenth century GermanKing Frederick III. Frederick had been a lapidarian as well as an astrologer andalchemist, and, like Hitler, and many Kaisers before and since, had cherishednotions of the conquest of other nations. Although Frederick III had failed inhis dreams of megalomaniac grandeur, the gold settings of this collection ofmystic gems were inscribed with the letters AEIOU. When Hitler was told thatthis cipher meant Austria Est Imperare Orbi Universo — it is for Austria to rulethe whole world — he saw it as an omen for his dreams of the Greater Reich. Sobefore the next Nuremberg Rally, the mayor presented Hitler with facsimilecopies of these pieces.When the war began, Hitler the occultist realized that he needed the real thing,so he personally took possession of all the regalia of the countries that theGerman Army overran. From Vienna they looted the coronation regalia of the HolyRoman Empire from the Imperial Treasure Room. This wealth included the jeweledcrown of the Emperor Conrad, a magic shield, two swords and an orb. These wasalso the famed Spear of Destiny… Although the regalia had been kept in Viennasince 1804, the Nazis discovered a fifteenth century decreee by the EmperorSigismund that they should be kept at Nuremberg… From Prague, the regalia of theancient Bohemian kings disappeared into Germany, and from the bombed ruins ofWarsaw Castle disappeared the Polish royal treasures.In appropriating these regalia, Hitler continued the ancient magical traditionof conquerors taking away relics of national power as symbols of theirvictories, for possession of the emblems of rule is traditionally believed toensure the continuance of that power. The Emperor Napoleon I took the emblems ofsovereignty from his subject nations, and the practice was continued in theBritish Empire. The magical jewel of the Sikhs, the Koh-i-Noor diamond, whosename means Mountain of Light — was taken from India to grace the symbols ofBritish monarchy.25It is important to understand that this activity was not merely understood byHitler as the mere exercise of the rightful possession of the victor over thetreasures of the vanquished.Something more was involved:> The ancient tradition of the divinity of kings also applied to their regalia,> which were not merely symbols but actually instruments of a magical> technology. By appropriating the regalia of subject nations, he believed that> the magical powers of rulership inherent in the symbols would be transferred> to him.26This belief in the divinity of Kings and the special powers inherent in theirsymbols of authority goes back, of course, to ancient Mesopotamia, and to TheCosmic War that was fought over the possession of the Tablets of Destinies.27While this is not the place to review extensively the beliefs of the ancientMesopotamian cultures, it is to be noted that two things about those beliefswould have immediately caught the Nazis’ attention: (1) the belief that theancient kings were chimerical human- divine offspring of a mingling with “thegods,” a belief well in keeping with the Thule Society’s belief that the Aryansoriginated from “Atlantis” and ultimately, off this planet entirely, and (2) thebelief that the Tablets of Destinies and their magical powers showed all thesigns of being a lost high technology.All this breathtaking Nazi “regalia collecting” was accompanied by an even moresinister activity: actual geomancy. As we shall see in subsequent pages, thebuildings and temples on sacred sites, sites whose locations were themselvesdetermined by arcane methods,> were specifically designed to channel and enhance those (Earth) energies to> the exclusive use of the priesthood that owned then, for to possess these> sites was to have control of the ‘psychic body’ of the whole country. In> ancient times, the sacred layout of the country was held to be essential for> the well-being of the fields, the flocks, and mankind, so the government of a> nation depended upon control over the country’s geomancy.28The origin of this Nazi interest in geopolitical geomancy was most likelyHitler’s geopolitics guru, General Karl Haushofer, head of the Institut fürGeopolitik at the University of Munich, and university mentor to Hitler’s firstdeputy, Nazi Party Reichsleiter and occultist Rudolf Hess.Hess, in command of the Nazi Party’s own intelligence gathering organ, thePeople’s Organization for Germans Living Abroad, or the so-called Auslandsdivision, placed his mentor Haushofer at the head of this organization. In thistwin role of the head of the premier geopolitical institution in the world aswell as having access to the party’s own considerable intelligence organization,Haushofer conceived of his grand geopolitical scheme. “His was the head whichconceived of the plan by which Germany was to conquer the world.”29 A veteran ofthe Kaiser’s General Staff, Haushofer was a military attaché to Germany’sembassies in the Orient including a stint as the military attaché to the GermanEmbassy in Tokyo. There, he learned Japanese and “became initiated into one ofthe most arcane Buddhist secret societies.”30But that was not all there was to the general.

He often had> premonitions, upon which he acted. He convinced Hitler that the Institut(sic)> must find out everything about its enemies: strengths, weaknesses, impending> famine, religious sensibilities, the personalities and tastes of officials,> the morals and corruptibility of even minor bureaucrats, the views of opinion> makers. To collate, sift through, and interpret all this material on every> country in the world, Haushofer enlisted a staff of more than a thousand> students, historians, economists, statisticians, military strategists,> psychologists, meteorologists, physicists, geographers, and other specialists,> working in Germany and abroad.The researches apparently paid off. When, in 1938, the General Staff was worriedthat France would mobilize if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, Haushofer assuredthem that it neither could nor would. He turned out to be right. He argued thatPoland could be conquered in eighteen days. The military disagreed. They fearedtheir armored trucks would bog down in the Polish mud. Haushofer said it was notlikely to rain. It did not. The General Staff didn’t believe Germany shouldinvade Norway. Haushofer prophesied that it would be easy. The military wantedto invade France when war first started. Haushofer urged that they wait untilGerman propaganda had made its full impact on the people. He also dictated whenthe campaigns in Africa and the Balkans would begin. It was his idea that theNazis make temporary friends with Russia, despite widespread anxiety aboutcollaborating with the Communists. He wooed Latin America for its usefulnessagainst America.33 It is to be noted that among the types of experts that Haushofer gathered in hisgeopolitical institute were physicists, strongly suggesting that the Nazis knewthere was something deeper to ancient geomancy than just peculiar alignments ofstructures on an astronomical grid. In short — and it is a crucial point tocomprehend — Haushofer was attempting, and in a great measure succeeded, inbringing scientific rationalizations to ancient geomancy, transforming it intothe modern “science” of geopolitics, a geopolitics that had something to do withphysics. There are other clues suggesting this fact, and we shall return to themmomentarily.image [images/00022.jpg] General Karl Haushofer, Mentor to Nazi Party Leader Rudolf Hess, andGeopolitical Guru of Adolf Hitler The upshot of Haushofer’s geopolitics, however, and of the Nazis’ moregeneralized interest in all manner of claimed occult “powers,” was that theywere searching for modern scientific rationalizations of ancient legends andlore, and by finding such rationalizations, were attempting to restore losttechnologies of power:> …Nazi occultists were deeply interested in all obscure manuscripts. They> carefully investigated all the ancient archives they plundered in their> rampage across Europe in a search for some further knowledge which could aid> their creation of the ‘New Order’.Amongst this welter of half-forgotten occult lore resurrected by the Nazis wasthe physical control of nations by means of the ancient science of geomancywhich some call ‘earth magic’. In ancient times, they found, a nation’s mostsacred place was also invariably its seat of government. Possession of thissacred place, the psychic centre of the nation, meant dominion over it… … (The) whole science of geomancy finally became an essential magical tool inthe conquest of Europe.34 Thus, the “lines of force” which German grid researchers had uncovered inCentral and Western Europe were understood by the Nazis as tools to be “used aslines of conquest.”35But why would Haushofer’s geopolitical institute employ — amid its grab bag ofmeteorologists, geographers, psychologists, strategists and other specialists —physicists?C. A Deeper Physics?1. Ashlars and Engineering The answer to that question brings us more directly into contact with the Earthgrid, and the mysterious energies that may inadvertently have been tapped in thethermonuclear theurgy of those first h-bomb tests. In bringing down thethermonuclear fire of the gods-stars to the surface of the Earth, the scientistsand engineers involved in designing and testing those devices were in factengaged in a very ancient undertaking: alchemical architecture.The conception of “alchemical architecture” — an architecture deliberatelyemploying sacred geometries and numerology in an attempt to bring down to Earththe transforming powers of the heavens — is an old conception, and forms one ofthe pillars, pun intended, of Freemasonry. Those “transforming powers” however,are both of a purely physical, but also a purely spiritual and social, nature,and the two, as we shall see throughout this book, are closely connected in theancient mind by what it considered to be the underlying physics of the medium.One may understand the Masonic obsession with the social aspect of thisalchemical architecture by a closer look at its conception of “ashlars.” In myprevious book LBJ and the Conspiracy to Kill Kennedy I noted both these aspects— the physics and social engineering aspects — of the symbolism of the Masonicashlar, and it is worth citing those remarks at length here, for they are nowgermane to the wider context of the geomantic energies that such alchemicalarchitectures seek to evoke in the Earth grid by the placement and design ofcertain types of temples and structures:> According to Albert Pike, author of the Scottish Rite’s “Bible” of> Freemasonry, Morals and Dogma, an ashlar is a symbol of the whole philosophy> of the Masonic Craft:> You will hear shortly of the Rough ASHLAR and the Perfect ASHLAR, as part of> the jewels of the Lodge. The rough Ashlar is said to be “a stone, as taken> from the quarry, in its rude and natural state.” The perfect Ashlar is said to> be “a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, to be adjusted by the> working-tools of the Fellow-Craft.”… They are declared to allude to the> self-improvement of the individual craftsman, — a continuation of the same> superficial interpretation.The rough Ashlar is the PEOPLE, as a mass, rude and unorganized. The perfectAshlar, or cubical stone, symbol of perfection, is the STATE, the rulersderiving their powers from the consent of the governed; the constitution andlaws speaking the will of the people; the government harmonious, symmetrical,efficient, — its powers properly distributed and duly adjusted in equilibrium.36 > It is to be noted that the context of this piece of Masonic ritual is> understood to be a symbol of people, both in an unorganized condition — the> “rough ashlar” — and in an organized, that is to say, a socially engineered> condition — the “perfect ashlar.” This will be an important interpretive> context in a moment.> The second thing to be noted about the quotation is the double-edged sense in> which many of its statements — particularly that about “the rulers deriving> their powers from the consent of the governed” — can be interpreted. There is> obviously the prosaic sense, namely, that Pike simply means to indicate the> nature of the republican form of American government, and is mouthing pious> patriotic platitudes. But there is the deeper sense explored in the previous> chapter, that of the consent of the people to an obviously criminal act, and> even more criminal “explanation” and cover-up, an act of consent which> increases the powers of the occult rulers performing the ritual.> The deep connection between this “alchemical” social engineering and Masonic> ritual is made clear by another reference to the “ashlar” occurring much later> in Pike’s tome in reference to citations from the ritual of initiating a> Knight of the Sun, or Prince Adept, the twenty-eighth degree of the> thirty-three degrees of Scottish Rite Freemasonry:> A rough Ashlar is the shapeless stone which is to be prepared in order to> commence the philosophical work; and to be developed, in order to change its> form from triangular to cubic, after the separation from it of its Salt,> Sulphur, and Merecury, by the aid of the Square, Level, Plumb, and Balance,> and all the other Masonic implements which we use symbolically.> Here we put them to philosophical use, to constitute a well-proportioned> edifice, analogous to a candidate commencing his initiation into our> Mysteries. When we build we must observe all the rules and proportions: for> otherwise the Spirit of Life cannot lodge therein. So you will build the great> tower, in which is to burn the fire of the Sages, or, in other words, the fire> of Heaven; as also the Sea of the Sages, in which the Sun and the Moon are to> bathe. That is the basin of Purification, in which will be the water of> Celestial Grace, water that doth not soil the hands, but purifies all leprous> bodies.37This quotation requires careful attention and care in unpacking its carefullycoded language.The “philosophical work” referred to is precisely the alchemical operation ofconfecting the Philosophers’ Stone, the transformation of matter, the bringingdown of the materia prima into earthly form. But there is also an esotericoperation, that of the transmutation of base metals into gold, in this case, thebase metal of unenlightened humanity into the pure gold of an illuminatedconsciousness. The “philosophical work” is thus a code for these two types ofoperation.38But our real interest in this passage lies in the bold face passages. Note theuse of “Masonic implements,” the square, level, plumb and balance. If one didnot know that this was a nineteenth century Masonic text, one might conclude onewas reading a bizarre description of the torsion physics experiments of Russianastrophysicist Nikolai Kozyrev. The passage hints, obliquely, that it is talkingabout an encoded physics, an encoded physics probably unknown even to a Masonicadept like Albert Pike.This is darkly hinted at in the second paragraph. Masonry is an alchemicalcraft, for in the metaphor of constructing buildings according to the sacredgeometry of Masonic “architecture” the real goal is to embody “the Spirit ofLife” in those buildings. That one is dealing with a physics here is evidencedby the next part of the passage, referring to “the fire of the Sages” which is“the fire of heaven,” the energy of the sea of space-time itself, the “zeropoint” energy of the vacuum.That this is so is further reinforced by the use of a standard code often foundin ancient texts for this physical medium of space-time, for in those texts deepspace is referred to as “the abyss,” the “primeval waters or primeval ocean,”and this is what we see in this Masonic text where the sun and moon are said to“bathe” in this sea.Finally, note the reference to building “the great tower.” While this could beconstrued to mean the Masonic principle of embodying “rule and proportion” intophysical buildings and thus embodying “the Spirit of Life,” there is a deepermeaning. Recall that Hoffman stated one long term goal of such alchemicalworkings was to reinvoke the gods of old. The reference, in other words, is anancient one, and at this level of meaning the “great tower” is the Tower ofBabel itself, a tower which, according to the biblical story, would reach toheaven and allow men “to do whatever they imagined to do.” I have arguedelsewhere that the real purpose of this tower — and of all pyramidal structuresin one form or another — was to access this energy of heaven, this energy of thevacuum, of space-time itself.39On this reading of the passage, we are indeed dealing with a very ancientagenda, the agenda of turning the “rough ashlars” of stone into the “perfectashlars” of structures able to summon the fire of heaven itself. We are dealing,in other words, with an encoded physics.40Alchemical architecture, in other words, encompassed two aspects: thearchitecture or engineering of society, and the architecture or engineering ofthe physical medium itself, and notably, within Masonic tradition, these twowere clearly seen as being connected.2. Transmitters, Temples, Sacred Sites, and Nazis Thus, with the SS’s infiltration of fraternal societies, it should come as nosurprise that there are some slight suggestions that the Nazis saw theconnection between sacred sites and a potentially deeper physics, for NaziGerman radio and radar stations were constructed on “ancient mark-points in theland’s sacred geography.”41 Indeed, Nazi high-energy research seems to have beenin part driven by physics considerations of various points on the Earth gridwithin the Third Reich:> The place where the ‘occult arts’ and official science came closest together> is in the real of earth-radio-magnetic-psychic energies. By the 1930s,> luminaries like Nikola Tesla claimed that electronic research was close to> perfecting the ‘death ray’. German scientists saw this as the ultimate weapon> which would guarantee world supremacy. Working with high-voltage X-rays the> Nazi physicist Schieboldt attempted to develop a ray that wopuld destroy an> aircraft in flight.42 Code-named Hdubrand, a similar device used intersecting> beams of infrared energy to burn up enemy aeroplanes. This line of study> proved fruitless, but one of its spinoffs was the electron microscope, now a> fundamental research tool in both biology and materials science. Hitler had> said “If we had more powerful microscopes, we would discover new worlds,” and> the electron microscope did just this. It has indeed been one of the few> useful legacies of the Third Reich.43In connexion with this high-energy research, various mysterious ‘transmitters’were erected at several ‘key points’ in the Reich. In 1938, the Brocken, acelebrated peak in the Harz mountains, was the site of feverish constructionwork. Holy mountain of the goddess Freyja, the Brocken is best known for thecurious optical phenomenon known as the ‘Brocken spectre’, which occurs when theshadow of a person on the summit is cast by the rays of the sun onto a cloudbelow. Under some conditions, this ‘spectre’ has a saintly halo around its head.This ‘transmitter’ was a strange contraption, a tower surrounded by an array ofposts with pear-shaped knobs on top. At the same time a similar system waserected on the peak of the Feldberg near Frankfurt. When it began operation,there were soon reports of strange phenomena in the vicinity of the Brockentower. Cars travelling along the mountain roads would suddenly have enginefailure. A Luftwaffe sentry would soon spot the stranded car, and tell thepuzzled motorist that it was no use trying to get the car started at present.After a while, the sentry would tell the driver that the engine would work againnow, and the car would then start up and drive away.Years later, after the war, the ‘car paralysis’ phenomenon was reported time andagain in association with UFO sightings. Whatever its function, this‘transmitter’ was emanating a field of energy sufficient to short-circuit theelectrical systems of nearby cars.44An event during the war demonstrated that these transmitters were being used insome sort of weaponized capacity.On January 24, 1945, two American P-38 twin-engine fighters were dispatched toinvestigate the reports of a Nazi “magnetic wave” weapon near Frankfurt. TheP-38 of Lt. Hitt suddenly began to experience malfunctioning of all itselectrical equipment as he drew close to the transmitter installation near theFeldberg at Frankfurt, including his compass, which began to spin through 360degrees, and his plane’s two engines which began to sputter and run very rough.The other pilot, flying nearly a mile away from Lt. Hitt, experienced no suchdifficulties. Upon their return to base Lt. Hitt’s difficulties generated anintelligence report entitled “Preliminary Report on Suspected Magnetic ray.” ABritish engineer did calculations to determine how large such a facility had tobe, and he concluded that it would have been a facility using such largeground-based coils as to render the idea impractical. The German transmitters,however, as we have seen, involved no such coils, but were, rather, a series ofantennae laid out in circular fashion — almost mimicking the henge- like stonestructures that dotted the European and British landscapes — with pear-shapedbulbs at their end. As I have observed elsewhere, “This implies that the Germandevice operated on different principles than what the Allies expected, giventhat the description of these antennae (does) not resemble that of a huge set ofcoils.”45But if there were different principles involved, what were they?One clue is perhaps afforded by the postwar conclusions of yet another Germanelectrical engineer, Prof. Dr. Konstantin Meyl, who noticed not only thatcertain ancient Greek and Roman temples were built according to the principlesof “sacred geometry,” but also that they could, if viewed with the eye of anengineer, function as vast wave-guide cavities for simple radio telegraphy!Ancient temples, in other words, were deliberately constructed as simple radiotransmitters!46The placement of such temples — and the Nazi transmitters — on world “grid”sites suggests that the Nazis did indeed discover or re-discover some aspects oflong lost science. In this connection, it should also be noted that they showedimmense interest in Nikola Tesla’s schemes for the wireless broadcasting ofelectrical power.While this is not the place to recount the nature of Tesla’s wireless electricalpower broadcasting technology in detail,47 there are certain features that mustbe noted in terms of the Earth grid. Tesla’s scheme was dependent upon makingthe Earth itself as the transmitting medium by establishing standinglongitudinal electrical waves within it.This requires some unpacking.A longitudinal wave is not a typical sine or Hertzian wave, but rather, apressure or pulse. We may understand the difference between the two types ofwaves by means of a simple analogy. If we imagine two people standing with ajump rope suspended loosely between them, and then one person jerking the ropeup and down, that upward jerk will transmit a loose “S” shape down the rope tothe other person. This would represent a standard Hertzian wave, the kind ofelectromagnetic energy that we are familiar with in light, radio signals, and soon. Notice, that most of the energy generated in creating the wave is lost inthe creation of that initial jerking motion, and only a fraction of that energyis received by the person holding the rope at the other end, and it does so sometime later than the initial pulse.Now we replace the jump rope by placing a yardstick between the two people, andone of them repeatedly pushes or “pulses” his end of the yardstick. Instantly,that pulse transmits virtually all the energy of the pulse to the person at theother end of the yardstick. This is a longitudinal or pressure wave.But what has this to do with the Earth grid, and with the Nazi transmitters? Theanswer is very simple. Recall that the British engineer consulted to runcalculations on the amount of power that would be needed by the Frankfurttransmitter would have been enormous, and would have required enormous coils.This is our clue that he was thinking in terms of (1) only one transmittingantenna, and (2) of standard Hertzian or “jump rope” waves. Whereas, we haveseen that the two Nazi transmitters at the Feldberg near Frankfurt and theBrocken were both composed of several antennae, and this is our clue that theywere transmitters designed to send out not Hertzian “jump rope” waves, butlongitudinal “yardstick” pulses. If we can imagine, for the moment, the Earthitself being a smooth pond, into which we toss a handful of pebbles, we will seeimmediately what is happening. As each pebble — representing one pulse from oneantenna — hits the surface of the pond, it will send out a circular pressurewave which will overlap with all the other waves being created by all the otherpebbles. Where these waves overlap, we get nodal points, where the energy of allthe waves meeting at that point is added together.48Thus, one need not have asingle installation with large coils, but in actual fact, the best system wouldbe several smaller systems with several antennae each sending out overlappingpulses. It is thus possible that the Earth grid actually consists of nodalpoints created by such standing waves overlapping on the surface of the Earth,being guided by local landscape (which would function as wave guides).49 It thusseems evident that the Nazis, working with some version of Tesla’s wirelesselectrical broadcast technology, had discovered at least some aspects of thephysics behind ancient geomancy and the world grid system.D. A Review of the Building Case So, at the end of these previous two chapters, what do we have?Three salient facts emerge from the survey thus far, and they are each suffusedwith implications for Earth grid research:> 1) The lithium-7 explanation for runaway yields on early hydrogen bomb tests> is quite possibly a cover for a discovery of something else: > a) In the case of the “Mike” test it fails utterly, since no lithium-7 was> even involved, making its subsequent use as an explanation for the “Castle> Bravo” test at best a partial explanation, and at worst, a lie; and > b) In the latter case, the idea that the engineers and scientists did not know> about the reaction until after the test occurred is also unlikely, since the> “fraud” in Argentina,Dr. Ronald Richter, clearly and unequivocally stated that> he knew about it, and his Argentine interlocutor, Dr. José Balseiro, clearly> did as well. The fact that a slightly asymmetrical compression might have led> to the rotation of the nuclear plasma, and thus to the induction of energy> from unanticipated torsion effects into the reaction, squared fully with> Richter’s own explanations of his research, as well as with the research and> statements of Dr. Kozyrev in the Soviet Union. In Kozyrev’s case, the fact> that his research disappeared into the deepest classification after a public> denunciation in Pravda strongly suggests that Soviet thermonuclear engineers> may have incorporated his insights into the design of the massive “Tsar Bomba”> hydrogen bomb, tested with a yield of 57 megatons. By inducing torsion effects> into the reaction, the placement of such devices, and the timing of a test> vis-a-vis local celestial geometries, would effect the efficiency of such> devices to greater or lesser degrees, determinable only by means of actual> observation, and therefore, nuclear testing;50 > 2) These grid energies in turn were perhaps based upon interfering standing> waves in the medium of the Earth itself, and possibly present at certain nodal> points — places where such waves intersected — nodal points moreover located> precisely at ancient sacred sites. In the case of the Nazis and their> transmitters, it would seem to be indicated that they had at least understood> that some aspects of ancient engineering were tapping into these energies, and> they placed their transmitters accordingly, hoping to tap into it; > 3) It would not have been lost to the Nazi scientists, just as it was not lost> to their English counterparts, that the early Grid research clearly and> unequivocally demonstrated recurring astronomical alignments. But how such> astronomical alignments figured into the actual physics and technologies> remains to be seen, though again, a clue is afforded by the early H-bomb tests> and the work of Drs. Richter and Kozyrev; and finally, > 4) Especially in the case of German secret societies, one finds the notion of> a hidden and esoteric continuity of institutions with ancient times and> mystery schools, a belief that reinforced the idea that there was indeed a> hidden wisdom and lost science to be recovered. As we shall see, there was indeed a “quantum mechanical conundrum” to the Earthgrid and ancient sites that, during the time of these early researchers, was notknown nor anticipated.

This,tied with the fact that the Soviets certainly knew of the Nazi Bell device viaSS General Jakob Sporrenberg’s Polish War Crimes trial affidavit, makes it verylikely that torsion research in that country was fueled in part by earlier Naziwartime efforts, and the realization that those efforts were continued by theNazis under the nominal aegis of Perón’s Argentina in Richter’s project."},{"pageContent":"3 ANGKOR WAT, ASTRONOMY, AND ARITHMETIC: AN ENTRANCE INTO THE GRID AND ITS EXPLANATIONS > “Nobody sets out to build 50,000-plus pyramids and mounds around a planet just> for the hell of it, or want of something to do.

Munck1Cataloguing all the research of various authors who have noticed the placementof ancient sites on a grid system spanning the globe would be a difficult, ifnot impossible task. Indeed, merely cataloguing all the researchers who havewritten on the subject would be nearly impossible, for virtually everyone in thefield of “alternative research” has been compelled, by the nature of the fielditself, to say something about it at one time or another. Well known andprominent names such as David Hatcher Childress, Graham Hancock, Alexander Thom,Sir Norman Lockyear and numerous others have commented or written whole booksabout the subject and in so doing have joined the ranks of grid researchersalong with less well-known names. As we saw in previous chapters, those rankswere swelled even more by a panoply of Nazis, and a Soviet astrophysicist — Dr.Nikolai Kozyrev — whose work’s implications touched directly on aspects of thephenomenon. Accordingly no attempt to do either will be made here.But what, exactly, is the “Earth grid”?We clearly need some sort of working definition, one capable of modification asour survey proceeds. Let us begin with a simple definition: Ancient sites,temples, and structures are laid out upon a grid whose significance isdetermined by their placement at mathematically significant places upon thesurface of the Earth, or in correspondence with celestial, astronomicalalignments, or both, and often incorporate these and other mathematicalanalogues in the structures themselves.A. Anomalies at the Temples of Angkor We need only consider the famous site of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.image [images/00023.jpg] Angkor Wat in Cambodia Well-known alternative researchers Graham Hancock and his wife Santha Faiiapoint out some very odd connections of Angor Wat to another well-known cultureharboring many sites on the world grid, Egypt:> The name ‘Angkor’, although supposedly a corruption of the Sanscrit word> nagara, ‘town’, has a very precise meaning in the ancient Egyptian language —> ‘the god Horus lives’. Other acceptable translations of ‘Ankh-Hor’ or ‘Ankhor’> are ‘May Horus Live’, ‘Horus Lives’ and ‘Life to Horus’.2Of course, such etymological coincidences are just that, coincidences. Or arethey?1. The Ancient Prime Meridian: Giza Hancock and Faiia observe a very peculiar thing about the placement of theAngkor temples, a placement that ties them to Egypt in a very direct andunavoidable way, nor are they by any means alone in their observation, for ithas been repeatedly observed by other grid researchers. It is apparent, theymaintain, that when one studies the placement of various sites and monumentsaround the world — Angkor Wat, Teotihuacan, Tikal, Stonehenge, Avebury, and ahost of others too lengthy to mention — that they are placed with Giza as theprime meridian, with that meridian in fact running through the apex of the GreatPyramid itself.3 When this is done, Angkor Wat lies at almost exactly 72 degreeseast longitude from Giza.4That number, 72, requires some special commentary of its own. It is, of course,the exact measure of the spacing between points of a pentagon and pentagram ifcircumscribed by a circle. The years allotted to the various Hindu yugas — thefour great world ages — are all divisible by 72:1,728,000 years, the Satya yuga1,296,000 years, the Treta yuga 864,000 years, the Dvapara yuga 432,000 years, the Kali yuga5Dividing by 72 gives some very interesting results:> 24,000 > 18,000 > 12,000 > 6,000 The yugas, in other words, are all harmonics, or multiples, of 72, in theorderly progression of 24, 18, 12, and 6. Interestingly enough, if one dealsonly with the coefficients of the Hindu yugas — the numbers themselves — bydropping three orders of magnitude, then one ends up with 1728, 1296, 864, and432, all numbers which are encoded in the dimension of the temple at AngkorWat!6 Nor are these the only things encoded there.2. As Above, So Below: The Astronomical Correlation and the 10,500 BC Mystery In 1996, Hancock’s and Faiia’s research associate, John Grigsby, discovered thatthe layout of the temples of Angkor Wat corresponded with the northernconstellation of Draco. Thus, there was another odd correlation to Egypt, for“just as the three Great Pyramids Giza in Egypt model the belt stars of thesouthern constellation of Orion, so too do the principal monuments of Angkormodel the sinuous coils of the northern constellation of Draco.”7 By runningastronomical programs, Hancock and Faiia determined that at sunrise of thespring equinox in 10,500 BC the constellation Draco was due north of the Angkorcomplex.8 This corresponded exactly to the date of the three major Gizapyramids’ alignment to the three stars of the belt of the constellation Orion:10,500 BC.However, there was a problem. If one accepted the conventional dating of theGiza compound to ca. 2500 BC,9 how would one account for such a similarmemorialization of a very ancient date — 10,500 BC, thousands of miles away, andnearly three millennia later, in Cambodia?> Indisputable archaeological and inscription evidence proves that the temples> of Angkor were built by named and known Khmer monarchs, almost all of whom> reigned during the four centuries between AD 802 and AS 1200.10Why were massive monuments being built in Cambodia to memorialize a date almosteleven millennia previous to the time of their construction? And why were suchmemorializations present in both Egypt and Cambodia?The pattern of this Egypt-Cambodia link only deepened the closer Hancock andFaiia looked. For example:> 1) Both in Cambodia and in Egypt, there was a tradition of an “architect of> the gods” who was responsible for the building of such monuments and who> taught architecture to men. In Egypt’s case, this was Imhotep; in Cambodia’s> it was Visvakarma; > 2) Both Egypt and Cambodia venerated the serpent as a sacred figure11 (and, as> we shall see, Meso-America as well!), and “in both cases it was the hooded> cobra that was selected as the archetype, in both cases it could be depicted> in art as a half-human, half-serpent figure.”12 Again, the same, as we shall> discover, holds true for Meso-America as well; > 3) Both in Egypt and in Cambodia this “serpent god” could also symbolize> either the sky or the ground; and finally, > 4) Both in Cambodia and in Egypt the serpent could symbolize immortality and> the cycles of the universe; > 5) Both in Cambodia and in Egypt, it was believed that when the king died, his> soul would ascend to the heavens.13 All this raises the problem of explaining why such odd correspondences should befound in two such disparate cultures, and why that one date in particular —10,500 BC — should be embodied in both:> So the real questions at Angkor are not so much a matter of the absolute dates> of the construction of the various temples, or even of the many substructures> that are known to lie beneath them, but rather:> 1. Why does the overall site-plan focus so insistently and specifically on the> pattern of stars in the sky region surrounding the constellation of Draco as> it looked at dawn on the spring equinox in 10,500 BC? > 2. How can we explain the fact that this same precise date is signaled by the> three great Pyramids and the Great Sphinx of Giza — monuments that are not> thought to be linked in any way to the temples of Angkor? > 3. Is it not amazing that all three groups of monuments use the same> architectural technique to draw attention to that date, i.e. by modeling a> prominent constellation that was present at one of the cardinal points of the> sky on the spring equinox in 10,500 BC (Draco to the north, in the case of> Angkor; Leo, to the east, in the case of the Great Sphinx; Orion to the south,> in the case of the Pyramids)? > 4. Could there be some sort of hidden connection?14 Hancock and Faiia have noticed the central mystery of the grid: why do so manydisparate cultures appear to be building massive monuments, at different timesand places, and yet, seem to be doing so as if following some sort of plan?One answer immediately comes to mind: the grid-building activity was the programand product of a hidden elite:> Another explanation… (there) could be an undetected ‘third party’ influence,> very discreet, very secretive and of very great antiquity. Such an influence —> perhaps the long-lived and highly motivated society that referred to its> initiates in ancient Egypt as the ‘Followers of Horus’ — does seem immensely> improbable. Nevertheless, as Sherlock Holmes famously reminded Watson in The> Sign of Four, ‘when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,> however improbable, must be the truth.’15Yet there is another clue as to the nature of this elite and its activities in asymbolism more universal than that of the “Followers of Horus.”3. Enter the Serpent The symbol of the wise serpent in this case turns out to hold an answer — or atleast, part of an answer — to the 10,500 BC mystery and to the possibility of aconnection via a hidden elite.> Angkor Wat’s western entrance is a place of shadows before dawn when the sun> lies invisible in the east beneath the vast mass of the temple. Even in low> light it is impossible to ignore the dominant presence of the Naga serpents> which, with their stone bodies, and rearing, hooded heads, form sinuous> balustrades lining the causeway. The same cobra motif in numerous different> forms is frequently, almost incessantly, repeated — leading one authority to> conclude that Angkor Wat ‘was wholly dedicated to serpent worship. Every angle> of every roof is adorned with a seven-headed serpent.’16As we shall see elsewhere in this book, this is not the only time we willencounter a serpent motif in conjunction with the monuments of the world grid.We have already noted, however, the serpent motif is present in Egypt, in thehooded headdress of the pharaohs, representing the extended hood of a cobra. Thepharaohs, in other words, were not only kings claiming descent from the gods,they were not only “Followers of Horus” but they were also in a certain sense“serpent-kings.”This chimerical human-serpent motif is found, curiously enough, in the Hinduconceptions underlying the symbolism of Angkor Wat, for these multi-headedserpents, the Nagas, represent a kind of trans- dimensional creature, “crossingthe realms of sky and ground, time and space, this world and the next andalthough they intermingle — and sometimes intermarry — in the material realm ofearth and men there is never any doubt that their true identity is as celestialand cosmic forces.”17 This Egyptian-Hindu link is further compounded beyond thepoint of coincidence when one examines closely the respective cosmologies of thetwo cultures.Within Hinduism, Vishnu, the primordial “all-god” creates the universe throughthe sheer strength and force of his will. But this is accompanied by an explicitsexual metaphor, as Vishnu ejaculates into the primordial cosmic waters. This isparalleled in the Egyptian cosmology by Atum, who, coming forth from theprimeval waters of the Nun, ejaculates into the cosmic waters.18It is important to pause and consider the full implications of this cosmologyand its explicit sexual metaphor. In both cases, the primordial condition, withthe “Self-existent” Vishnu or Atum, is one where there is absolutely nothingelse in existence. Thus, even the “primordial waters” are, to some extent, “partof” this self-existent “god” or “state” or “condition.” The ejaculation of semenby this god into this ocean, from which He is not distinct, is, in effect, theinjection of “seed” or differentiating information into himself.The parallels do not end there however.4. The Topological Metaphor As we shall see subsequently, within the Egyptian cosmology, theself-differentiation of Atum gives rise to the first three neters, a “triad” or“primordial trinitarian differentiation.” It is the same within the Hinducosmogony, for in the Padama Purana we read:> In the beginning of creation the Great Vishnu, desirous of creating the whole> world, became threefold: Creator, Preserver, Destroyer. In order to create> this world, the Supreme Spirit produced from the right side of his body> himself as Brahma then, in order to preserve the world, he produced from his> left side Vishnu; and in order to destroy the world he produced from the> middle of his body the eternal Shiva. Some worship Brahma, others Vishnu,> others Shiva; but Vishnu, one yet threefold, creates, preserves, and destroys:> therefore let the pious make no difference between the three.19Note that neither in the Egyptian nor in the Hindu versions of this “primordialtrinitarian homosexual ecstasy” are we dealing with any notion of a theologicalrevelation.We are dealing, rather, with the “topological metaphor” of the physical mediumitself, as I noted in the appendix to chapter nine of The Giza Death StarDestroyed,20 and again in The Philosophers’ Stone,21 and it is worth recallingwhat I stated there concerning the emergence of this “trinity” from theinformation-creating processes of the physical medium as viewed in yet otherancient traditions, in this case, the Neoplatonic and Hermetic.In order to understand what the ancients meant by all the variegated religiousand metaphysical imagery they employed to describe this topological metaphor —in order to decode it — let us perform a simple “thought experiment.” Imagine anabsolutely undifferentiated “something.” The Neoplatonists referred to this“something” as “simplicity” (απλωτης). Note that, from the physics point of viewand from that of Hinduism itself, we are dealing with a “nothing,” since it hasno differentiated or distinguishing features whatsoever.Now imagine one “brackets” this nothing, separating off a “region” of nothingfrom the rest of the nothing (Vishnu’s ejaculation metaphor). At the instant onedoes so, one ends up with three things, each a kind of “differentiated nothing.”One ends with:> 1) the “bracketed” region of nothing; > 2) the rest of the nothing; and, > 3) the “surface” that the two regions share. Note something else. From a purely physics point of view, this occurs withouttime, since time is measured only by the relative positions of differentiatedthings with respect to each other. The “regions of nothing” and their commonsurface are, so to speak, still eternal, and yet, at the same instant, a kind of“time” has emerged simultaneously with the operation of differentiating itself.In short, from a non-quantifiable “nothing,” information begins to emerge withthe process of “bracketing” or “differentiating” itself, including the conceptof number. On the ancient view, then, numbers do not exist in the abstract. Theyare, rather, functions of a topological metaphor of the physical medium.22Now let us go further into this topological metaphor by notating our threedifferentiated nothings mathematically. There is a perfect symbol to representthis “nothing”, the empty hyper-set, whose symbol is image [images/00024.jpg],and which contains no “things” or “members.” Now let our original “nothing” besymbolized by image [images/00025.jpg]. A surface of something is represented bythe partial derivative symbol ∂, for after all, a “surface” of something, even anothing, is a “partial derivative” of it.So, we would represent our three resulting entities as follows:> 1) the “bracketed” region of nothing, orimage [images/00026.jpg]; > 2) the rest of the nothing, orimage [images/00027.jpg]; and, > 3) the “surface” that the two regions share, orimage [images/00028.jpg]. Note now that the three “nothings” are still nothing, but now they have acquiredinformation, distinguishing each nothing in a formally explicit manner from eachother nothing. Note something else: the relationship between them all isanalogical in nature, since each bears the signature of having derived from theoriginal undifferentiated nothing; each retains, in other words, in its formaldescription, the presence of image [images/00024.jpg]. And this will be true nomatter how many times one continues to “bracket” or “differentiate” it. On thisancient cosmological view, in other words, everything is related to everythingelse by dint of its derivation via innumerable steps of “differentiation” fromthat original nothing. It is this fact which forms the basis within ancientcivilizations for the practice of sympathetic magic, for given the analogicalnature of the physical medium implied by these ancient cosmologies, in purelyphysics terms, everything is a coupled harmonic oscillator of everything else.23Finally, observe how this formal explicitness dovetails quite nicely with theHindu conception that the created world is, in fact, illusion, a “nothing,” buta differentiated nothing.Now let us take the next step in the decoding of this topological metaphor inancient texts and cosmologies. It is understood within the kind of mathematicalmetaphor that we are exploring here, that functions can be members of the emptyhyper-set without destroying its “emptiness,” for the simple reason thatfunctions are not “things” or objects, but pure processes. Thus far, we havedealt with regions, and surfaces, now we add functions.Here is what I wrote in The Giza Death Star Destroyed about the three entitieswhen examined from the standpoint of a passage of the Hermetica:The passage is the Libellus II:1–6b, a short dialogue between Hermes and hisdiscipline Asclepius:> “Of what magnitude must be that space in which the Kosmos is moved? And of> what nature? Must not that Space be far greater, that it may be able to> contain the continuous motion of the Kosmos, and that the thing moved may not> be cramped for want of room, and cease to move? — Ascl. Great indeed must be> that Space, Trismegistus. — Herm. And of what nature must it be Aslcepius?> Must it not be of opposite nature to Kosmos? And of opposite nature to the> body is the incorporeal…. Space is an object of thought, but not in the same> sense that God is, for God is an object of thought primarily to Himself, but> Space is an object of thought to us, not to itself.”24> This passage thus evidences the type of “ternary” thinking already encountered> in Plotinus, but here much more explicitly so, as it is a kind metaphysical> and dialectical version of topological triangulation employed by Bounias and> Krasnoholovets in their version in their model. However, there is a notable> distinction between Plotinus’ ternary structure and that of the Hermetica:> whereas in Plotinus’ the three principle objects in view are the One, the> Intellect, and the World Soul, here the principal objects in view are the> triad of Theos, Topos, and Kosmos (Θεος, Τοπος, Κοσµος), or God, Space, and> Kosmos, respectively.These three — God, Space, and Kosmos — are in turn distinguished by a dialecticof opposition based on three elemental functions, each of which in turn impliesits own functional opposite:image [images/00029.jpg] So in Hermes’ version of the metaphor, the following “triangulation” occurs,with the terms “God, Space, Kosmos” becoming the names for each vertex orregion:image [images/00030.jpg] This diagram is significant for a variety of reasons. For one thing,theologically informed readers will find it paralleled in the so-calledCarolingian “Trinitarian shield,” a pictogram used to describe the doctrine ofthe Trinity as it emerged in the Neoplatonically- influenced AugustinianChristianity of the mediaeval Latin Church. Again, it must be recalled in thiscontext that the Greek Fathers objected to this formulation of the doctrine inthe strongest possible terms, and viewed this dialectical structure as not somuch metaphysical, as “sensory,” i.e., as more applicable to physical mechanicsthan to dogmatic theology.More importantly in this context, however, the diagram illustrates how eachvertex — God, Space, Kosmos — may be described as a set of functions or theiropposites:image [images/00031.jpg] Hermes’ version of the metaphor thus lends itself quite neatly to an analysis interms of Hegelian dialectic, with Space itself forming the synthesis betweenGod, the thesis, and Kosmos, the antithesis, described in terms of the functionsf1, f2, f3 or their opposites.To see how, let us extend the formalism by dispensing with Hermes’ metaphysicaldescription of the functions f1, f2, f3 and take the terms God, Kosmos, andSpace as the sigils of distinct or discrete topological regions in theneighborhood of each vertex in the diagram on the previous page, and model themas empty hypersets. Since it is possible for combinatorial functions to bemembers of empty sets, then letting image [images/00032.jpg] stand for God,Kosmos, and Space respectively, one may quickly see the lattice work thatresults from entirely different sets of functional signatures, exactly as wasthe case in Plotinus, but via a very different route:46image [images/00033.jpg] Note that space in Hermes’ version of the metaphor, since it comprisesfunctional elements derived from the other two regions — “God” and “Kosmos” —could be conceived as the common “surface” between the two. Thus, once again, wehave our familiar three entities:> 1) the “bracketed” region of nothing, or image [images/00026.jpg], Hermes’> “Kosmos”; > 2) the rest of the nothing, or image [images/00027.jpg], Hermes’ “God”; and, > 3) the “surface” that the two regions share, orimage [images/00028.jpg],> Hermes’ “Space” With this in mind, let us now look once again at the passage concerning Vishnuand the Hindu version of this primordial triad, from the Padama Purana, half aworld and millennia removed from the Hermetica and related texts of Egyptianprovenance:> In the beginning of creation the Great Vishnu, desirous of creating the whole> world, became threefold: Creator, Preserver, Destroyer. In order to create> this world, the Supreme Spirit produced from the right side of his body> himself as Brahmal then, in order to preserve the world, he produced from his> left side Vishnu; and in order to destroy the world he produced from the> middle of his body the eternal Shiva. Some worship Brahma, others Vishnu,> others Shiva; but Vishnu, one yet threefold, creates, preserves, and destroys:> therefore let the pious make no difference between the three.26Once again, note that the three resulting entities, after Vishnu “differentiateshimself,” are described in functional terms. So we may substitute the namesVishnu, Brahma, and Shiva for Hermes’ God, Kosmos, and Space. And again, one ofthese, Brahma the “preserver”, appears to be a functional “set” of “nothing”that is a common surface of the other two, Vishnu the creator and Shiva thedestroyer:image [images/00034.jpg] Androgynous Shiva image [images/00035.jpg] Note in the case of the Padama Purana that the functional set identified witheach region or “manifestation of Vishnu” is described by a function (creation),its inverse (destruction), or the inverse of the other two (preservation). Andagain, we have the same three entities:> 1) the “bracketed” region of Nothing, or image [images/00026.jpg], Hermes’> “Kosmos”, and the Padama Purana’s Shiva; > 2) the rest of the Nothing, or image [images/00027.jpg], Hermes’ “God” and the> Padama Purana’s Vishnu; and, > 3) the “surface” Nothing that the two regions share, orimage> [images/00028.jpg], Hermes’ “Space” and the Padama Purana’s Brahma.The implications of this sort of analysis are profound and far- reaching, forthey suggest that behind certain types of metaphysical texts, particularly thosesuggesting triadic structures, there is a much deeper topological metaphor thatsuch texts are designed to encode and transmit. It suggests that all such textsare capable of a deep topological analysis, and that they have nothing, really,to do withmetaphysics in the conventional philosophical or theological senses atall. They also suggest, as more and more differentiations are added to thisprocess that account for the rise of physical creation, that there is a physicsreason for the phenomenon of the world grid. They suggest that, as the physicalmedium is the information-creating and transmuting Philosophers’ Stone itself,that the purpose of the world grid and its constructions is one of an“alchemical architecture,” of the monumental manipulation and engineering of themedium itself, for after all, on the ancient view, once again, everythingderives from that nothing and is a multi-differentiated nothing, directly tiedin with everything else.In these metaphysical and religious texts, in other words, we are looking at aprofound topological and physics metaphor. We are looking at declined legaciesof a very ancient, and very sophisticated, science.5. Cosmology and History: A Hidden Elite, and a Hidden Physics? With the “topological metaphor” in hand, let us return to Angkor Wat, and lookmore closely at other aspects of the Hindu cosmology memorialized in the grandand intricate stone edifice. One of the many stone reliefs at Angkor Watportrays a Hindu cosmological conception called “the Churning of the MilkyOcean” by the five-headed Naga serpent, Vasuki.27 On one of the panels depictingVasuki, his long body is coiled around a mountain, Mount Mandera. Mount Manderais, in turn, one of the four mountains butressing Mount Meru in Hinducosmology.28 These mountains are, like the “primordial mound” of Egypt’s “ZepTepi” or “first time,” the primordial mountains of Hindu cosmology.Vishnu himself is above this mountain, clutching Vasuki’s body with two of hisfour hands “and seeming to control or direct its movement.”29 Vasuki is grippedon one side of his long body by an asura or a “high-ranking demon,”30 and on theother by three gods and 85 devas “of lesser stature.”31 Between them, Vishnu issuspended, gripping Vasuki in the center of his body coiled around MountMandera, as if superintending this cosmic tug-of-war, as Mount Mandera “is beingrotated, first one way then the other, by the opposing forces of the devas andasuras.”32As this back-and-forth churning and counter-rotation continues, eventually therearises a foaming mass, a “Sea of Milk” or “the Milky Ocean”, from which the Moonand other celestial bodies appear, followed by the goddess Lakshmi, Vishnu’swife.33 Mount Meru and its four buttressing mountains, including Mount Mandera,are the mountains at “the center of the world”34 and thus, from their“churning,” give rise to the physical world from the action of rotation, from avortex.This is a profound metaphor, and again, a distinctively physics- relatedmetaphor, for what is being suggested is that one of the key methods by whichthings arise from that primordial nothing, and the means by which they aredistinguished, is by complex systems of rotation and counter-rotation. Even “theMilky Sea” has a profound physics analogue in the “sea of quantum flux” or“vacuum energy,” the sea of the void of space-time, which in quantum theory isliterally teaming with vast energy potential, and which, in some versions of thetheory, is accessed by the rise of rotating systems. In some versions of thetheory, particles themselves are but systems of rotations with this otherwiseinchoate sea of energy, and anyone familiar with the vast quantum mechanicalparticle zoo will know at once that particle families are distinguished by,among other things, their spin or rotation.Once again, behind the seemingly irrational religious and mythological imagerylurks a profound metaphor of very contemporary and sophisticated physics.These observations are worth comparing with those of Hancock and Faiia, who,looking at the stone reliefs of the Churning of the Milky Ocean at Angkor Wat,see yet another physical process:> There is a cosmological process that fits the bill: precession — the slow,> cyclical wobble of the axis of the earth that inexorably changes the positions> of all the stars in the sky and shifts the ‘ruling’ constellation that lies> behind the sun at dawn on the spring equinox. It is this process, according to> Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend in their landmark study Hamlet’s> Mill, that is the subject of a whole family of myths coming down to us from> remotest antiquity. The Churching of the Milky Ocean, they say, is one of> these myths.The great contribution to scholarship made by Hamlet’s Mill is the evidence itpresents — compelling and overwhelming — that, long before the supposedbeginnings of civilized human history in Sumer, Egypt, China, India and theAmericas, precession was understood and spoken of in a precise technicallanguage by people who could only have been highly civilized. The prime imageused by these as yet unidentified archaic astronomers ‘transforms the luminousdone of the celestial sphere into a vast and intricate piece of machinery. Andlike a millwheel, like a churn, like a whirlpool, like a quern, this machineturns and turns endlessly.’35 But given all we’ve seen thus far, the answer of de Santillana and von Dechend,and of Hancock and Faiia, is not deep or complete enough. What we’ve observedthus far is that these mythological cosmologies are metaphors operating on threedistinctive levels:> 1) at the deepest level, of a topological metaphor of the physical medium> itself, and of its “analogical” information-creating properties; > 2) at a less deep level, of a physics metaphor of the emergence of creation,> of particles, from the vast ocean or sea of quantum flux, whose emergence is> described in terms of rotation; > 3) similarly, at a less deep level, of a physics metaphor of the astronomical> machine of precession. With this in hand, we may propose a corollary thesis regarding the alchemicalarchitecture of the world grid: any theory of the world grid which takes intoaccount only one of these aspects is an incomplete theory.But there is one final aspect of the cosmology enshrined at Angkor War that mustbe examined, and it is the most controversial of them all.6. The Machine-Like Medium and Immortality Hancock and Faiia ask a significant question: why, at Giza, and Angkor Wat — andas we shall see, in other structures of the world grid — is there such a focusand fascination with the astronomical phenomenon of precession? Precession wasboth for the Egyptians and the builders of Angkor a virtual immortal, eternalcelestial machine. Accordingly, both in the Hindi cosmologies depicted at AngkorWat and in the religious cosmology of distant Egypt, precession was the means to“seize the sky” and its immortal processes. Understanding it, the initiate couldgain immortality.36 This machine-like character of the celestial medium was, inother words, conceived also as a gate to immortality. While this may seem to themodern reader to be the flights of purest mythological fantasy and imagination,the Hindu cosmology so beautifully depicted in the stone carvings of Angkor Watalso contains a key, for in the “churning of the Milky Sea” the nectar ofimmortality is created.37This, as we shall see in a subsequent chapter, is a profound clue to the deeperphysics behind the world grid.However, it is worth mentioning at this juncture that such a “deeper physics” isimplied by the Hindu cosmology, for it views this world — the world of our threedimensions, our senses and perceptions — as> not real at all but rather a sinister sort of virtual reality game in which we> are all players, a complex and cunning illusion capable of confusing even the> most thorough empirical tests — a mass hallucination capable of extraordinary> depth and power designed to distract souls from the straight and narrow path> of awakening which leads to immortal life.38This is the view implied by the “topological metaphor” we examined earlier inconnection with the Hermetica, and it has yet another incarnation in the worldgrid, for “with a synchronicity that seems strange to anyone who has studied themysteries of Central America,” the Hindus named this hallucination “Maya.”39Indeed, as we shall eventually discover, the connections go much deeper thanjust a name.B. The Master Plan of a Hidden Elite In addition to a “deep physics” implied by all this, there is also a “deephistory” laying underneath the ground of Angkor Wat, a deep history testifyingto the antiquity not only of the cosmological views of the Vedas but of theplacement of the site itself. Hancock and Faiia note that Hindu traditionascribes great antiquity to the actual contents of the Vedas, which wereinitially passed down for thousands of years as an oral tradition by Brahmanpriests before their codification into the books we know today. Even here, thisoral transmission is not understood by the Hindu tradition to be the originaltransmission, but a “repromulgation” after the previous age of calamity andcatastrophe. This work of repromulgating an earlier tradition was the work ofthe seven Rishis, or seven sages, who survived the previous cataclysm and “whosedesire it was ‘at the beginning of the new age… to safeguard ‘the knowledgeinherited by them as a sacred trust from there forefathers in the preceeding(sic) age.’”40 Viewed another way, what the Rishis represent is a survivingelite from a catastrophe, doing what all such elites do in such circumstances:trying to preserve the knowledge that made a previous high state of civilizationpossible, in order to attain a similar development in the future.Not surprisingly then, “all the major temples of Angkor also show similar tracesof having been built directly on top of earlier structures which may in turnhave been built on the sites of earlierstructures still,”41 dating back to theperiod when the constellation Draco, itself representing the great cosmicserpent, rose over the spring equinox in 10,500 BC. Once again, we shalldiscover in later chapters that the same can be said of many other sites on theworld grid: while the structures themselves may be comparatively new, they areoften built according to a preconceived plan dating back to remotest antiquity.This activity of a surviving elite is encoded within Hindu tradition in yetanother intriguing way, for many of Vishnu’s incarnations follow a pralaya, acataclysm that, interestingly enough, is most often a world-destroying flood.Hindu codices state unreservedly that Vishnu’s objective on each of theseoccasions was precisely to save some of the knowledge “accumulated byantediluvian civilizations” and to secure its transmission to futuregenerations.42 In other words, Vishnu’s activities on such occasions representthe activity of a surviving elite, decorated and disguised in the pious languageof religion and mythology.At Angkor Wat — as at Stonehenge, Giza, Teotihuacan and so many other places onthe world grid — we are confronted with vast structures, temples, pyramids,monuments, all seemingly laid out in correlation with some astronomicalalignment, and all seemingly related to each other, as Angkor Wat’s placement ata certain longitude east of the Giza Prime Meridian testifies. This, as Hancockand Faiia state, is clearly suggestive of the activity of hidden players, of ahidden elite or elites:> …(We) have had the eerie sense of stumbling across the fragments of a strange> and shadowy archaic master game — a game on a planetary scale that ran for> thousands of years and that appears to have been played out in four principal> dimensions: First Dimension: ‘Above’ — stars in the sky; Second Dimension: ‘Below’ — monuments on the ground, scattered around theworld like pieces of an immense jigsaw puzzle, linked to one another throughoccult astronomical clues; Third Dimension: ‘Time’ — measured by the slow cycle of precession, theprincipal means by which the astronomical signposts pointing from one monumentto the next were hidden to the uninitiated; Fourth Dimension: ‘Spirit’ — the point of it all, the quest forimmortality. The game — if game it was — has the feel of a beautifully self- referentialsystem, one with interlocking and mutually interconnected features that bear allthe hallmarks of an intelligent and highly organized design.43 Reduced to its basic level, Hancock and Faiia are stating that the world gridembodies the following four principal features:> 1) A celestrial or astronomical reference, “as above;” > 2) an earthly reference in the vertical dimension — “so below” — in which> those astronomical references are embodied in the layout and dimensions of> structures, each of which also appears to be linked to other such structure on> the “horizontal” dimension by their placement on the earth’s surface; > 3) a temporal reference embodying the slow cycle of precession; > 4) a spiritual reference suggesting that all this has something to do with> immortality. As we shall see, the deeper into history and further back in time we go, theconnections to physics get even broader and deeper, encompassing monumentsmemorializing not only the physics of the very large in astronomical alignments,but also memorializing the physics of the very small in precise structuralanalogues to aspects of quantum mechanics. Additionally, we shall also discoverarithmetic and hyper-dimensional properties embodied in these structures — andtheir placement on the globe — that point to a purpose beyond merememorialization of certain aspects of physics, but to a purpose that suggeststhey were designed to manipulate and engineer it.

In view of all of this, “coincidence” is not an explanation that can berationally entertained.44But what elite is involved in all this activity, according to Hancock and Faiia?> But the dimension of time still veils much: 10,500 BC is the astronomical> dating of the ground plan of the Pyramids and the Sphinx; 2500 BC is the> astronomical dating of the alignments of the Great Pyramid’s shafts (supported> by undisputed archaeological evidence of intense activity at Giza around 2500> BC); 10,500 BC is the astronomical dating of the ground plan of the Naga> temples of Angkor Wat, with undisputed archaeological evidence that the entire> complex of monuments at Angkor were built over slightly more than four> centuries between AD 802 and AD 1220.What powerful common source of high knowledge and what shared spiritual idea;descending through what underground stream, could have been sufficiently globalin manifestation, sufficiently ancient, and sufficiently sustained, to have madesuch a deep impact on the culture of Egypt at around 2500 BC and 3500 yearslater, on the culture of the Khmers in Cambodia between the ninth and thethirteenth centuries AD?45 Their answer is simple, and ingenious, and faithful to the textual andmythological traditions represented by the various sites in whose cultures theyoccur:> What better candidates could there be for the masters if a game with> immortality as its goal than the Followers of Horus, the Shemsu Hor, the> wielders of magic, the counters of the stars — who are said in the ancient> texts to have come to Egypt in the First Time?46We shall have occasion to comment on the Shemsu Hor or Followers of Horus in alater chapter, but for now it should be noted that this “good” elite — whetherone calls it the Followers of Horus or the “Brotherhood of the Seven Rishis” orthe “Society of the Incarnations of Vishnu” — is only part of the story.There is another elite or elites, a “bad” or “evil” elite, as we shall see,that, fully in possession of the same knowledge, had rather different purposes,agendas, and uses for the monuments of the world grid.For now, we have noted the curious anomaly of larger-than-expected yields fromearly hydrogen bomb tests, the curious placement of Nazi headquarters on pointson the world grid, the activity of apparent elites placing ancient structures inastronomical alignments and positioning them according to a prime meridianrunning through Giza. We have noted the presence in Hermetic and Hindu texts andcosmologies of a profound “topological metaphor” of the physical medium, thefabric of space-time. And finally, we have noted the persistency and continuityof those elites over vast millennia, as evidenced by their common activityenduring through those millennia and cultures.But what of the other components of the world grid: the arithmetical andgeometric?Those answers will be explored in the next chapter, in connection with the two“mathematical masters of the global matrix.”1 Carl P.

It ismy opinion that he did not do so, not because he was unaware of it, but rather,because he was trying to popularize and render Egyptian cosmological thoughtunderstandable to lay audiences.23 Of course, everything is not necessary an efficient oscillator of any othergiven thing, but that is a more complex aspect of the ancient cosmologies andtheir topological metaphor than can be explored in this chapter.

There are in addition to these indicators, traditions long associatedwith such “power places” on the world grid, particularly in Europe and GreatBritain.Paul Devereux is an Englishman who, along with his “Dragon Project,” has beenattempting to conduct scientific investigation into such locations on the gridwhere local tradition and lore ascribes paranormal occurrences to them,including attempts to investigate the infrasonic and infrared properties of suchplaces, which oftentimes returned anomalously high, or alternatively, lowamounts of such sounds and radiations.3 It should also be noted that Devereuxand his research team often found that their readings of infrasound or infraredenergies often varied with the phases of the Moon, that is, in response to thewider celestial geometries! Shades of Kozyrev!4Additionally, Devereux and his teams also discovered “noteworthy anomaliesrelating to background radioactivity and natural magnetism at certainmonuments.”5 But beyond these anomalous findings, there is the matter oftradition and rumors themselves: > Throughout the twentieth century, popular rumour has maintained that ancient> sacred sites harbour strange powers. This belief has its origins in anecdotal> reports of unusual happenings at such places, and centuries of folklore> ascribing supernatural properties to old standing stones and mysterious> earthworks.6 In Devereux’s opinion, the ultimate source of these traditions comes from theancient belief that “the earth was alive, with subtle but powerful forcesflowing through its body, the land,” forces which concentrated themselvesaccording to the “spirit of the place”, the genius loci.7Accordingly, Devereux, more than most researchers of the world grid phenomenonand its ancient places, assembled a vast catalogue of traditions about suchplaces, “in the hope that actual recall of the megalithic technology may bepartially contained within it, however fragmented and distorted.”8A. Devereux and The Traditions of Places of Power1. Moving and Immoveable Stones One of the most persistent of these traditions is that movement, or, conversely,immovability, is attributed to the stones of such monuments. Stones were said tomove to nearby brooks or rivers to drink, or alternatively, rise up at certaintimes of the day — in some cases heralded by the chiming of a nearby clock — orcertain times of the year.9 Alternatively, other traditions hold that certainstones cannot be moved at all or, “if they are so displaced, will either returnautomatically or else cause such problems that the person involved will obligedto return the stone, and will find it supernaturally easy to do so.”10 One may,and should, of course, view such traditions with due skepticism for very obviousreasons.But viewed a different way, these traditions are actually describing somethinghaving profoundly to do with physics and with the properties of mass andinertia. As will be seen shortly, Devereux is alive to the possibility thatthere may be a much deeper, and older tradition, of cosmology and physics atwork in such legends. In short, one may be looking at a decayed and declinedlegacy in such traditions, one that at a much older time might have entailedexplanations shorn of totemistic and shamanistic imagery.2. Uncountable Stones and Stones of the Giants and Gods Other local traditions — at least in Great Britain — hold that some of the stonehenges and circles that dot its landscape are populated by stones that refuseall attempt to enumerate or count. Each time a person tries to count them, adifferent answer will obtain. Similarly, “Many megaliths or large naturalboulders are said, in folklore, to have been placed in their positions by giantsof old.”11 Stonehenge itself was once known as the Giants Dance,12 andsimilarly, the stone circles of Sanguli in far-off Africa were said by localtribal traditions to be “built by ancient people who were eight metres tall.”13Yet another famous megalithic site, Baalbek in Lebanon, whose thousand-ton-plusstone “trilithion,” was according to tradition said to have been built by Cainand an ancient giant race.14 While this association of megalithic sites withgiants is not universal, it does have echoes, as we shall see, in places asdiverse as Meso-America, South America, and Egypt, where similar giant stoneconstructions are attributed to the gods or to the giants, or associated withthem in some other fashion.3. Desecration, Inhabitation, and Treasure Traditions In other traditions, disturbing stones — in effect, desecrating them — areassociated with various curses for doing so, among which are that the desecrator“can expect to be subjected to severe weather conditions such as freak winds orfierce electrical storms.”15 In this case, notes Devereux, there are actuallyexamples in the modern record of this actually happening: > In 1849, for instance, when Dean Merewether of Hereford and his team were> digging at Silbury Hill near Avebury in Wiltshire, a ‘dramatic high Gothick> thunderstorm’ broke out, and men working deep within the great mound felt it> shudder to its base. The Dean wryly observed that the significantly timed> storm was ‘much to the satisfaction… of the rustics.’16 Similarly, in 1940 a farmer approaching the so-called Hobgoblin Stone nearLampeter in Wales with the intention of breaking it up to make gateposts wassubjected to a violent thunderstorm which pursued the poor man as he ran for hishome.17In addition to these “desecration traditions,” there are also traditions thatmaintained treasure was often associated with the site, in a manner recollectingassertions of vast buried treasures of wealth and knowledge in the secret andancient sites of South America.184. Divination, Animation, Healing, and Numerical Traditions In other traditions, megalithic sites, in addition to their astronomicalorientations, were apparently used for actual divination.19 Local customspracticed in conjunction with this oftentimes “involve the numbers three, sevenor nine.”20 We have already seen how the number three emerges as a function ofthe topological metaphor in the previous chapter, and we have alreadyencountered the seven sacred sages or Rishis of the Hindu cosmology. We shallencounter these numbers, and the number nine, again when we turn to Egypt in asubsequent chapter.In addition to these peculiar traditions, especially those depicting movingstones, there are also other legends suggesting that these monuments areanimated and connected with life in other fashions, including traditionsascribing healing, virility, and fertility to various stones in suchmonuments.215. Gateway Traditions Finally, as Devereux notes in the case of the traditions of the American PuebloIndians, there are legends connecting such sacred sites to the flow of energiesbetween this plane of reality and “other concurrent realities,”22 as a kind ofgateway or door between worlds of one reality or another. Strangely enough, thisis reflected further south in the legends of the Maya and Aztecs, and also inMesopotamia, where the very name Bab-El or Babylon means literally, “door” or“gate of the gods.”B. Devereux: The Cosmology and Physics Implications of the Traditionsof Places of Power1. “Strange Radiation” Traditions All of this potently suggests that we might be looking at not just a hodge-podgeof entirely unrelated legends and lore about such places, but rather, at dimmemories of their possible purpose and function, a purpose that was, moreover,attributable to some kind of function for such monuments beyond enshriningcertain measures and astronomical alignments. They are strongly suggestive of anunderlying technological purpose and meaning; they suggest we are looking atcogs in a vast machine.This is made more evident, at least for Devereux, when one turns to consider oneof the more widespread traditions associated with such sites, that of “strangeradiations.”From the pyramids to Giza to those of Mexico, and from the henges and earthworksof Britain to those of North America and continental Europe, there are abundanttraditions that associate the presence of strange lights or glowing aura aroundsuch monuments.23 No one, for example, who has studied the lore associated withGiza in Egypt, or Teotihuacan in Mexico, can help but encounter such stories,for they are numerous and plentiful. In one sense, this is entirely to beexpected in the case of the massive stone pyramids of Meso-America and Egypt,for the piezoelectric properties of quartz under stress are phenomena that areregularly scientifically studied. Quartz crystals, when shattered or subjectedto stress, give off minute bursts of electricity, which show up as sparks oflight. And the massive structure of the Great Pyramid, composed of enormousamounts of limestone and granite — both types of rock embedding tiny quartzcrystals — is certainly in one sense a gigantic piezoelectric capacitor.24So in one sense, such stories are to be expected, for the phenomenon is nowwell-known to science. Yet, this does not exhaust the anomalous nature of whatsometimes is encountered at such sites. For example, Devereux uncovered evidencethat Native American Indians were familiar with concentrations of naturalradioactivity and even marked such sites with distinctive petroglyphs: > American researcher, Marsha Adams, has uncovered indications that a recurring> symbol found in prehistoric Native America rock art in Arizona and Nevada may> indicate locations of strong natural radioactivity. Adams has measured five> sites where the rock art symbol in question appears. Increased amounts of> radiation were found at four sites, while there were extremely strong> radiation levels at one. Maximum radiation readings were found close to the> symbol of interest. In at least one case, Adams had to undergo decontamination> procedures when she returned home after fieldwork at the rock at sites.25 Of course, such abnormal and anomalous radiation readings could be rationallyexplained by the presence of high amounts of pitchblende or other radioactiveminerals in the area. But no conventional model would explain how the NativeAmerican Indian populations knew about them, other than, perhaps, feeling aslight heat from the rocks.2. Shamanism, Radiation, and Grid Sites This leads Devereux into a very interesting line of speculation, a line ofspeculation mingling various versions of shamanistic tradition and lore withmodern science. He begins by noting that in places of abnormally high backgroundconcentrations of radiation, concentrations often associated with such ancientgrid sites, many people experience some form of “heightened awareness” or“increased consciousness.”26 This, he hypothesized, is due to some sort ofunknown or little understood relationship between radiation and consciousness, arelationship he calls “radiation-psi.”This is not as wild as it at first might seem, for the Canadian neurologistMichael Persinger published a paper in the June 1995 professional journalPerceptual and Motor Skills entitled “On the Possibility of Accessing EveryHuman Brain by Electromagnetic Induction of Fundamental Algorithms.”Additionally, there is a solid argument to be made that at least some temples ofthe much later classical period relied explicitly on the knowledge ofradio-engineering principles, in part for long-distance communications purposes,and in part for the possible manipulation of emotional and mental states.27 InPersinger’s case, the induction of visions and memories is produced by a specialhelmet which beams powerfully concentrated magnetic fields into a person’sbrain.For Devereux, the implications of so many people having such experiences at somany ancient sites are clear, for they imply that physical energy effects “weredeliberately and opportunistically employed at ritual sites,” making them“simply one part of an ancient technology of consciousness manipulation thatincluded initiatory ordeals, ritual activity, dancing, drumming, sensorydeprivation, the use of drugs — and even the nature of (the) sitesthemselves.”283. Devereux and the Possibilities of a Deeper Physics For Devereux, all of this is a manifestation of the continuance within variouslocal lore and tradition in Great Britain of the ancient Druidic philosophy ofthe prime matter, the physical medium itself.29 The Druids, it seems, laid outall their sacred sites along straight lines, much as did Chinese practitionersof the geomantic art of Feng Shui.30 Like Hancock and Faiia, whom we encounteredin the previous chapter, Devereux began to understand that he was looking atmore than just a philosophy confined to megalithic sites in northwestern Europeand Great Britain: > At these monuments we are in the presence of technology, the impressive> remains left by a group of races who were the founders of what has become> today’s ‘Western culture’, which has put its stamp, indeed has stamped, over> most of the world.31 For Devereux, this technology was designed to manipulate some “life force,” thepower of the physical medium itself: “It could be accumulated and controlled tosome extent, and esoteric technologies were developed to this end.”32In short, we are looking at an alchemical technology, an alchemical architecturewhose very blueprint is the entire grid itself.But to understand just how intricate and carefully planned that grid was, andhow that planning is further evidence of a coordinated effort on the part of agroup or groups possessing the knowledge and techniques to do so, we must,inevitably, do a little mathematics, for it is in the numbers and measure of theplacement of these sites, as well as the numbers inherent in the structuresplaced upon them, that we begin — at first dimly, then with growing light andillumination — to perceive just how deep the physics embodied in them mightactually be, and how high a civilization actually left them.C. Munck and the Grid Grid researcher Carl P. Munck has been investigating the intricacies of theworld grid with a mathematical precision that is unparalleled both in itsbreadth and in its depth, leaving almost no relationship unfathomed betweenvirtually each place on that Grid and every other place on it. Indeed, Munckhimself would object that his approach is not so much mathematical as it isarithmetical.33 For Munck, who calls himself an “archaeocryptographer,” numbersare indeed the code that links and decodes each component structure on theglobal matrix, not only in terms of its own unique position and purpose, butalso in terms of decoding its relationship to the other localities on the grid.In this approach to the primacy of numbers as the key to the Grid system, Munckis not alone, as we shall see, but he is certainly alone in the degree to whichhe has carried out detailed calculations.While more will be said in a moment about the details of Munck’s method indecoding this complex numerical relationship embedded in the Grid, one componentof it has already been mentioned in the previous chapter in our examination ofHancock’s and Faiia’s study of Angkor Wait, and it must again be highlightedhere: for Munck, as for other Grid researchers, the Grid only makes arithmeticalor numerical sense if one first uses Giza, or rather, the apex of the GreatPyramid itself, as the prime meridian of the ancient world,34 and secondly, onlymakes arithmetical and numerical sense if one uses — astonishingly — the Britishimperial system of measures and not the metric one.When this is done, an astonishing set of precisely placed relationships betweenvarious sites on the world Grid emerges, between such seemingly culturallyunrelated sites as: > 1) The largest North American Indian mound at Grave Creek, Moundsville, West> Virginia, and Sillbury Hill in England;35> 2) Chichen Itza in southern Mexico and Giza;36> 3) Teotihuacan, outside of Mexico City, and Giza;37> 4) The Florida circles and the Avebury circle in England;38> 5) Uxmal and Tikal in Meso-America, and Giza;39> 6) The Nazca lines in Peru, and everything else, for according to Munck, this> very old and strange monument — only visible from the air! — is a kind of> Rosetta Stone to the global Grid system;40> 7) Tikal in Central America, and everything else, for according to Munck,> this site, like the Nazca Lines in Peru, is a kind of “directory” to the world> Grid;41And on and on we could go, almost endlessly uncovering new relationships, solong as the apex of Giza’s Great Pyramid is used as the prime meridian. And tothis we may add, as we saw in the last chapter,> 8) Angkor Wat, and Giza.At most of these sites, one encounters one of two types of construction: eithera pyramid (or an earthen mound), or a stone or earthen circle.When one estimates the total number of such structures throughout the world oneobtains a rather astonishing figure: “85 in Egypt so far, more in the Sudan,over 100 in China, hundreds in Mexico, several dozen in Gautemala, several(unexplored) in Ecuador, estimates for 400 in Peru (all destroyed), the Akapanain Bolivia and reports of a super pyramid in Tibet.”42 To that, we may now addyet another, recently-discovered pyramid in Bosnia, unknown at the time Munckwrote his book.43 When one adds to this number all the various mounds ofeffigies or totems of various animals and the various stone henges and earthcircles, one is looking at literally tens of thousands of monuments, allprecisely placed on a huge global matrix.44 The purpose of all this placementaccording to Munck was, in part, precisely to mark significant locations on thematrix, but the reasons for doing so “are only partially clear at this time.”45There are, however, clues, and Munck, like Devereux, is not oblivious to thefact that something deeper is going on besides merely marking various locationson an abstract grid system. For Munck, the question is not who, when, and howthese monuments were built, but “why they were built as they were, and wherethey are.”46 Citing the famous case of the submerged pyramid in Rock Lake,Wisconsin, Munck notes that this site — like some of the megalithic sites inGreat Britain investigated by Devereux — is the home to consistent reports ofunusual phenomena. For example, local residents report seeing huge rocksfloating on the surface of the lake, or outboard motors on boats that will notwork at certain times, or how divers attempting to approach and film thesubmerged pyramid with their underwater cameras suddenly find they havemalfunctioned. Munck even notes that some divers report a strange sense of dreadas they prepared to dive to photograph the pyramid.47 For Munck, the clue to theresolution of this riddle may lie in the fact that another submerged structurein the lake, a triangle-shaped stone called the “Delta,” encodes the number5.337 in its placement on the Grid, a number close to the frequency of 5.34 MHz,which is a frequency in turn that its known to be able to alter the emotionalstate of an individual.48 In short, Munck, like Devereux, hints that at leastpart of the purpose in the placement of such structures might be the alchemicaltransformation of consciousness.This possible hidden microwave engineering in such structures also becomes, forMunck, a physics rationalization behind the Tower of Babel story. Assuming thestory to be true, Munck reasons that perhaps the builders simply built astructure that, when it reached certain dimensions, acted like a giganticmicrowave collector and reflector, literally transforming the brainwave activityof the builders and as a result, confusing the tongues!49While the microwave explanation is a speculative possibility, as we shall see insubsequent pages, the precision engineering of so many of these structuressuggests strongly that the designers of them, if not the builders, were at leastaware of the power of such structures to manipulate energetic radiations, makingsuch an “accidental” explanation of the “Tower of Babel Moment” unlikely, andthe biblical version of some sort of intervention from political motivationsmuch more probable.50In addition to all this, Munck, like Hancock and Faiia at Angkor Wat, concludesthat at least one of the major sites on the world Grid, Teotihuacan in Mexico,shows all the signs of several epochs of construction.51 This, suggests Munck,argues for a much earlier dating of the site than conventional archaeology wouldallow, placing the beginning epoch of construction to around 8000 BC, the sameera as some alternative dating for Stonehenge.52 While this is not yet the placeto evaluate the specific arguments for such an early dating of Teotihuacan, itis worth noting that such a date and extended period of construction implies thepresence of some group, an elite, with specialized knowledge and a long termagenda, an agenda considered to be so important that construction could not beabandoned over the long years of its undertaking.1. Munck’s Methodology With all this in mind, a closer look at Munck’s methodology is in order, formany aspects of it will form crucial components of our own examination ofcertain sites and structures in the remaining parts and chapters of this book.While Munck’s voluminous work does examine the earthen mounds and earthen andstone circles of other megalithic sites, our focus is on his methodology inexamination of pyramidal sites.The first of these methods is to “reverse-engineer” each pyramidal structure asit “came off the drawing boards of remote antiquity.”53 But in Munck’s handsthis implies two very specific, and crucial observations: > 1) True pyramids are five-faced objects, one side forming the base and the> other four faces forming the sides of the structure. Thus, the only true> pyramids in the world are the smooth-faced earthen pyramids in China, and the> smooth-faced stone pyramids of Egypt.54 All other pyramids are “corruptions”> of this basic form through the additions of staircases, terraces,> ornamentation, rectangular “temples” on their apexes or elsewhere on the> structure, and by offsetting terraces on some structures;55> 2) Thus, when “reverse-engineering” a pyramid, it is important to count all> the corners and faces, even on “corrupted structures.” When this is done, a> certain series of numbers will inevitably emerge from any smooth-sided pyramid> as a universal geometric law:> 1 — An apex at the top. > 3 — Each side of a true pyramid is actually a triangle with 3 sides or 3> corners. > 4 –Ground corners, or number of sides… > 5 — Total of 4 ground corners and the apex. > 8 — All ground corners and all sides. > 9 — Above 8 features plus the apex.56 Before commenting on the implications of this sequence of numbers, it isimportant to point out in the clearest possible terms the enormous implicationsof Munck’s method, for as wesh all see in the final chapter , this method ofcounting corners and faces is a clue to a profound and deep hyperdimensionalphysics and the formal mathematical and geometrical techniques employed todescribe it.If the last comment seems odd or even far-fetched, look closely again at thefirst two numbers embodied in a smooth-sided pyramid: one, and three, the verynumbers we saw emerge in the previous chapter in the topological metaphorcontained in the Hindu cosmology and in Hermetic texts, the very first twonumbers that emerge as functions of the differentiated physical medium containedin the metaphor. As we shall see in our subsequent examination of the cosmologyof Egypt, the other numbers of a pyramid enumerated above by Munck, also emergein that exact sequence within Egyptian cosmology! Egypt’s preoccupation withsmooth-sided pyramids would appear, then, to be anything but an accident, as itwould also appear to have little to do with entombing dead pharaohs. It haseverything to do with their view of physics and the physics of theinformation-creating, transumtative, alchemical physical medium itself. As weshall also discover in our examination of the Mesopotamian component of thismystery, it also has everything to do with music, with sound.> 3) The next crucial component in Munck’s methodology is his classification> scheme of ancient monuments. We have seen one component of this scheme> already, in the distinction between> a) Smooth-faced, or proper and true pyramids; and,> b) “corrupted” pyramids, to which alterations in the forms of terraces and so> on (and thereby the addition of more corners and faces to count), have been> added.Within each of these two classes, four further classifications are to bedistinguished: (1) structures embodying the geometric constant of π, (2)structures that “decode themselves” in only one aspect of their location, i.e.,either by longitude or by latitude, (3) structures that “decode themselves” withrespect both to latitude and longitude, and finally (4) structures that are notself-decoding in any respect of latitude or longitude, but that are decodableonly by reading the presence of other significant numerical relationshipspresent in the structure.57 One thus has eight classes into which a pyramid onthe Grid can fall:a) Smooth-faced, or proper and true pyramids;> (1) structures embodying the geometric constant of π;> 2) structures that “decode themselves” in only one aspect of their location,> i.e., either by longitude or by latitude;> (3) structures that “decode themselves” with respect both to latitude and> longitude; and finally,> (4) structures that are not self-decoding in any respect of latitude or> longitude, but that are decodable only by reading the presence of other> significant numerical relationships present in the structure.b) “corrupted” pyramids, to which alterations in the forms of terraces and soon (and thereby the addition of more corners and faces to count), have beenadded:> (1) structures embodying the geometric constant of π;> 2) structures that “decode themselves” in only one aspect of their location,> i.e., either by longitude or by latitude;> (3) structures that “decode themselves” with respect both to latitude and> longitude; and finally,> (4) structures that are not self-decoding in any respect of latitude or> longitude, but that are decodable only by reading the presence of other> significant numerical relationships present in the structure;> 4) The final component in Munck’s methodology is that it is necessary to> “de-toxify” measurements of such structures from the metric system and to> convert all measures into the British imperial system in order for the ancient> numerical code present in and between structures on the Grid to emerge.58While this point may seem at first glance to be purely arbitrary, it is in factbased on the careful and close study of ancient monuments themselves, and as Ipointed out in my previous book Genes, Giants, Monsters, and Men, there isconsiderable evidence that there is nothing really “British” about the imperialsystem of measures, and that the system comes down from high antiquity.59Within this constriction, there are a number of crucial techniques that Munckuses to derive the significant numbers, among them, the amount of cubic degreesin a sphere, squaring or cubing, or finding the square or cubic roots, ofnumbers, the tangents of numbers, and so on.A final component of this attention to specific numbers is the reliance upongematria, the ancient technique of assigning specific numerical values toletters in an alphabet. In this respect, Munck points out that the gematriannumbers are all multiples of 36, a significant number in the Sumeriansexagesimal system. These “Sumerian” numbers — all multiples of 36, are found inalmost all structure of the Grid, from Ohio’s Sep Mound, Mississippi’s EmeraldMound, the “Great Triangle” at Nazca in Peru, the Great Pyramid, Bent Pyramid,and Red Pyramid in Egypt, and even in the D&M Pyramid in the Cydonia region ofMars!60While we will deal more in detail with some of these structures in subsequentchapters, for our purposes here it is important to note what this vast listimplies, for once again, one is in the presence of a global phenomenon, implyinga group with global extent and a common mathematical and metrological heritageto conduct such a vast scale of constructions.It also implies something else, something usually missed by Grid researchers,and that is, the technique of gematria and the numbers “sacred” to it, issomething applied to texts as well as evidently to monuments. It thus stronglysuggests that one may not separate textual or mythological traditions from themonuments themselves. This will become a crucially important point when weexamine the Mayan and Aztec traditions of the monuments they found in theirmidst , and made use of.2. Munck’s Conclusions: The Work of an Elite The conclusions that Munck draws from this precise and exacting methodology ashe applied it to his years of research of the Grid clearly point to theexistence of at least one elite, extensive across not only the space of theglobe but also through untold millennia of time, for if sites of incomparableantiquity such as Stonehenge, and structures of purported later constructionsuch as the El-Kola pyramid in Egypt or the pyramids of Mexico all are found tobe speaking the same numerical and arithmetical language, then at least the planof the world Grid is of great antiquity.61There is, as Munck avers, also evidence of a suggestive sort that the Indianmounds of North America as well as the more massive Egyptian pyramids reach backinto remote antiquity, for the Native Americans would have had to build suchstructures “at the steady rate of over 25 per year — everywhere.”62 Nonetheless,as Munck also points out, tribal traditions do not record any construction ofthese sites in many cases; they are already present when the Indians arrived.Thus, many of the mounds and similar structures, contrary to traditionalarchaeology, were there many years before the tribes arrived. Similarly, inEgypt, notwithstanding the great antiquity of writing in that country, nowhereis the construction of its grandest structure, the Great Pyramid, evermentioned.63For Munck, all this vast methodology, combined with the sheer scale not only ofthe individual constructions, and also with the sheer scale of its global sweep,testifies to an extraordinary fact: > Nobody sets out to build 50,000-plus pyramids and mounds around a planet just> for the hell of it, or want of something to do. History teaches that these> primitive people were hunter-gatherers who spent their waking hours running> down their next meals. If that’s true, then who built these monuments? These> people didn’t have the time…. these things were not built at the whims of> medicine men. There was enormous global planning behind it all. In this assessment, the other great mathematical master of the earth matrix,concurs…D. John Michell, “Sacred Geometry,”“Sacred Science”, The Grid, and the Ancient Elite While Carl Munck may have run into gematria after years of research on theglobal Grid, British researcher John Michell (1933–2009) did just the opposite,having spent many years plumbing the numerical and gematrian depths of ancientand sacred texts, only to find the same thing encoded in the monuments of theworld Grid. As for many other researchers, for Michell the most prominentfeature of the Grid system is its universal extent across the globe.64 Ofunquestioned antiquity,65 there are, Michell maintains, perhaps even referencesto the system in the Old Testament.66For Michell, the overriding perspective with which to view the earth Grid systemis as a system of geomancy, that is, as “a science of landscape design based onthe idea of a living earth.”67 Curiously, general widespread European awarenessof this system only began in the nineteenth century, and due to a very curiouscircumstance: > A hundred years ago the practice of Chinese geomancy first became generally> known in the West through the complaints of European business men, who found> inexplicable resistance to their rational plans for exploiting the country.> Continually they were informed that their railways and factories could not> take certain routes or occupy certain positions. The reasons given were> impossible to understand, for they had no relevance, economic, social or> political, to the problem of laying out an industrial network. The Europeans> were told that a certain range of hills was a terrestrial dragon and that no> cutting could be made through its tail. Tunnels through dragon hills were> forbidden, and a proposed railway to run straight across low, flat country was> rejected on the grounds that the line would spoil the view from the hills. All> this was laid down by practitioners of the science of feng-shui, ‘wind and> water’, obscurely explained as ‘that which can not be seen and can not be> grasped’.68 It was during this same time period — the nineteenth century — that researchinto the grid system, or “ley lines,” first began in earnest in England andcontinental Europe, as we have seen, an interest that in turn was based onearlier probes, among them those of Dr. William Stukeley, an eighteenth centuryFreemason, who modeled his investigations after the seventeenth century work ofJohn Aubrey.69 Nor was Aubrey alone, for as early as 1580, Elizabeth I’s court“magician,” the “Aleister Crowley” of Elizabethan England, Dr. John Dee, noticedthat the earthworks around the famous Glastonbury abbey constituted a kind of“earthen Zodiac,” thus becoming the first in modern times to notice theastronomical alignments and significance of ancient sites.70Dr. Stukeley, however, was one of the first to observe the recurring presence inthese ancient sites of certain numbers also found as universal constants ingeometry and music, which in turn formed a crucial component of the hermetictradition of illumination in Freemasonry, a tradition we shall examine in muchmore detail in the section on Mesopotamia.71 In this, he anticipated the laterresearch of Munck and Michell themselves.But Stukeley and his forebear Dr. John Dee were not the first to notice thesystem either. The Spanish conquerors of Peru noticed the same “straight line”system in the far-flung Inca Empire, this time as a network of roads reservedfor the Inca Emperor and his messengers: > Fantastic efforts had been made to ensure that they ran dead straight. Stone> causeways were laid across marshes, steps were cut over mountains, tunnels> were bored through cliffs and amazing woven bridges spanned chasms. Obstacles> were never bypassed, but a way was built through or over them. In a very short> time these roads conveyed the Spanish missionary and military power through> every centre in the country.72 Nor were the Spanish even the earliest to notice the system, for according toMichell, the Romans ran into the same system of “straight line roads” as theirempire expanded into Gaul and Britain, over the ancient system of ley lines inthose countries, and soon paved these roads for Roman armies and commerce:“Unaware of any source of power except through trade and conquest, the Romansmay have thought that in laying their roads along the lines of theirpredecessors they were reestablishing a lost political empire.”73 Here I must,however, dissent from Michell, for there is abundant evidence that the Romans —or at least someone in the Roman republic — was well aware of the significanceof ancient sites and how to build temples that essentially functioned as simpleradio transmitters.74Adding all of the research together — that of Stukeley, Dee, Sir NormalLockyear, Heinsch and the German researchers, Michell reached an astonishingconclusion concerning the British part of the Grid, and it is worth citing ithere, for the same, as we have seen and shall see again, is true of Angkor Watand virtually every other place on the system: “The whole landscape of Britainhas been laid out to a celestial pattern. Every hill has is astrologicalmeaning, every district its centre of symmetry from which its hidden nature canbe divined.”75 This crucial point of “finding the center of a region” of landwill be seen in a moment.For now, however, there is another curious circumstance of the British componentof the system observed by Michell, and that is the recurring presence of noneother than the Egyptian god of wisdom, Thoth, and Baal, the ancient sun god,memorialized in place names along this ancient grid. Thoth was known asTheutates76 by the Druids, and Baal is found in Ball Hill, and there is even aBaalbeg — shades of Baalbek! — as the name of a deserted Scottish village aboveLoch Ness. And hundreds of Toot or Tot hills can be found dotting the Britishlandscape, testifying to Thoth.771. Finding the Center of the Land Delving deeper into this mystery, Michell learned one important principle was,as previously mentioned, to “find the center of the region.” The reasons forthis, however, were more than geomantic, for the social order itself depended,in a certain sense, upon it. Here, as elsewhere, the alchemical principle of “asabove so below” was operative, so that “social order is designed to reflect theorder of the universe”78 In short, there is for Michell a social engineeringcomponent to the Grid system.For Michell this social engineering component is further manifest in the ancientconception of kingship being “lowered from heaven,” a divine prerogative, as inthe ancient Sumerian and Egyptian civilizations. But for Michell, this divinecomponent is much more than just a claim of the ancient kings being chimericaloffspring of the “gods” and of man, but is rather a reflection of the celestialmachine itself: > At the locus of divine law, the cosmic pole is the most powerful symbol of> authority and is regarded as the only legitimate source of human laws. Its> many images include the scepter, the measuring rod, the king post, and the> central pillar. Kings and chiefs are installed upon the local world-center> rock, which empowers their rule, and when the rightful lawgiver pronounces> from it, his words have the same unchallengeable force as if the rock itself> had spoken.79 Thus, it became a consuming compulsion for ancient societies and kingdoms todetermine the center of their nation, the first component of this exercise beingto find or determine the main north-south axis of a given region or country. Itwas a symbol, an image, of the universal axis of the world.80 It was thisprinciple of geomantic power as the basis of political power that lay behind theselection of Hitler’s East Prussia headquarters, outlined in chapter two. Thenext step was to determine the “regional equator,” the main east-west axis.The principle is not entirely unknown to modern cartography, for “there arespecialists known as centographers, whose business it is to locate centers.”81In the United States, these specialists used what can only be called a “‘centerof gravity’ approach. They pasted a map of America on a board, cut out therelevant area, and found its point of balance on a vertical pivot.”82 When thiswas done, the center of the lower forty-eight states was found to be nearLebanon, Kansas.83 When Alaska and Hawaii were later added to the union, thesame method located the new center eleven miles west of Castle Rock in Buttecounty, South Dakota, a short way north of the small town of Spearfish in thenorthern Black Hills.84While such an approach may on the surface sound a trifle silly, it does suggestthat the center of gravity approach to a given surface and site location mightbe hinting at a deeper physics to such locations, a physics having to do withgravity and the very nature of space-time itself, a view also reinforced by theastronomical alignments of many of these sites.When this approach of finding the major north-south and east-west axes over themost land is taken with respect to the entire world, however, an interestingthing results, as the nineteenth century Scottish Astronomer Royal, Piazzi Smythobserved. Here, a map says it all:image [images/00036.jpg] Piazzi Smyth’s Map of the Center of the Surface of the World85 Giza, and more specifically, the Great Pyramid, are positioned as close to thenorth-south and east-west axes passing over the most land mass on the surface ofthe Earth, and additionally, over the northwest-southeast andsouthwest-northeast axes as well.86 It was hardly accidental then that Giza’sGreat Pyramid was set as a marker for the prime meridian. The question is, wasit something more than that, and if so, then what about the structures on therest of the Grid, and particularly, the pyramidal ones? 2. The Ancient Catastrophe, the Very High Civilization,and the Post-Catastrophe Elite Part of the mystery of the Grid for Michell, as for Hancock, Faiia, Munck andother researchers, is its apparent antiquity. Particularly in northern Europewhere such sites are evidently contemporaneous with, or even predate ancientEgypt, this phenomenon for Michell, as for the others, is “the relic of anancient scientific enterprise, conducted over many centuries and presumablydirected by a central college of astronomer-priests whose authority waseverywhere accepted.”87 And this poses tremendous problems for the “ex orientelux” standard model of cultural diffusion, in other words, the whole idea that> cultural, scientific and technological innovations were made in the early> civilizations of the ancient east, and reached Europe only in a dilute and> etiolated form through a slow and gradual process of diffusion. In terms of> this model, therefore, it is almost inconceivable that mere barbarians on the> remote north-western fringes of the continent should display a knowledge of> mathematics and its applications hardly inferior, if at all, to that of Egypt> at about the same date, or that of Mesopotamia considerably later.88 The sheer antiquity and scale of the undertaking led Michell to suppose that theGrid was the undertaking of some survivors of a very high civilization lost inthe mists of High Antiquity through some catastrophe.893. Michell on the Purpose of the Grid System But what was the purpose of all this activity? Michell’s answers to thisquestion go far beyond the usual “archeo-astronomical” or “archaeo-astrological”measuring markers, and even far beyond the idea of geodetic markers. For him,there is a much deeper functional significance to the global grid, a functionalpurpose perhaps revealed in the fact that, after whatever catastrophe as hadoverwhelmed the civilization that constructed it, the Grid system appeared tohave built to channel whatever energies it represented “to their own magicalpurposes.”90 Reviewing the work of the early twentieth century German Gridresearcher Heinsch, Michell notes that Heinsch’s conclusions were ratherbreathtaking, for “the laying out of a network of astronomical and geometricallines across the face of the earth implies a technology which would hardly havebeen developed to no practical purpose.”91a. Alchemy But if there were energies to be channeled, and if the grid does represent atechnology of some sort with “a practical purpose”, then what were thoseenergies, and what was the technology designed to do with them? What was its“practical purpose”? The global extent of the Grid itself poses enormousimplications for these questions:> Only within recent years, since the development of universal communications> allowed us to compare the antiquities of our own countries with those of> others, have we been able to see the extent of the vast ruin within which we> live. If we ignore all alterations to the landscape arising within the last> three thousand years and consider the world as it must have looked in> prehistoric times, the pattern that emerges is one so incompatible with our> idea of civilization that it is easy entirely to miss its significance. For> what we find is this. > A great scientific instrument lies sprawled over the entire surface of the> globe. At some period, thousands of years ago, almost every corner of the> world was visited by people with a particular task to accomplish. With the> help of some remarkable power, by which they could cut and raise enormous> blocks of stone, these men created vast astronomical instruments, circles of> erect pillars, pyramids, underground tunnels, cyclopean stone platforms, all> linked together by a network of tracks and alignments, whose course from> horizon to horizon was marked by stones, mounds and earthworks.92 Note the hidden implication of Michell’s remarks, for if the global Grid wastruly only perceived as a global network with the rise of modern transportationand communications in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, that implies thatthe elite or elites that constructed the Grid had at least a similar globalawareness. Such an awareness would, of course, be natural if that elite orelites were survivors of a prior Very High Civilization.But notice the real import of Michell’s remarks: modern man is living not onlyin the midst of a vast ruin of planetary extent, he was also living inside avast ruined machine of planetary extent, a machine to manipulate “something.”What that “something” may be was suggested by the research of William Stukeleyonce again, who discovered “recurrent forms — the serpent and the winged circle— which he identified as the symboils of the former patriarchal religion, onwhich Christianity itself was constructed.”93 We have already encountered asimilar “primordial patriarchal” image in the Hindu cosmology examined in theprevious chapter in relationship to Angkor Wat, but here it is crucial to notethat this winged serpent symbol is also common to Egypt, and as we shall see, toMeso-America as well. The image of “the serpent passing through the circle” isthe alchemical symbol of fusion par excellence, and Stukeley observed thissymbol at Avebury in England before the image was erased by encroachingcivilization.94As we saw in the previous chapter, this “serpent cosmology” contained a profoundclue to Hindu cosmology, which in turn led to a profound and deep “topologicalmetaphor” present in ancient texts, a metaphor of a primordial trinity arisingfrom the transmutative and information-creating nature of the physical mediumitself, as the ancients viewed it. It was this characteristic that made themedium the Philosophers’ Stone as such, and thus, Michell is quick to perceivethe deeply alchemical nature of the ruined architecture of the global grid, forthe “prehistoric alchemists were dealing with the earth itself, which theyregarded as the retort for the alchemical fusion between the ‘sulfur’ of solaror cosmic energies and the ‘mercury’ of the earth spirit.”95This point cannot be pondered too long, for if the “topological metaphor” ofancient cosmologies and texts has any grain of truth in it, then this means thatsomething more is involved in this prehistoric “alchemy” than merepseudo-science; one is looking not only at a ruined machine, but perhaps at aruined machine of much more sophistication than popular imagination, whetherancient or modern, would admit.b. Bloody Sacrifice Leaving no aspect of this alchemical mystery of the Grid unturned, Michell alsonotes something else, something sinister connected to some sites on the matrix:> The appearance of an organized spiritual technology, controlled by the> priests, was attended in every country by a massive increase in human> sacrifice. The Aztec massacres are notorious; the Druids in Ireland are said> to have decimated the population. The innumerable sacrificial stones, carved> with basins and channels for the flow of blood, and the traditional violent> and bloody associations of so many ancient sites confirms what is recorded of> the slaughter carried out by priests in the interests of necromancy. > The practice of human sacrifice flourished in the ruins of the universal> civilization. The secrets of spiritual invocation, once common property, had> become exclusive to those appointed by the community to procure the seasonal> renewal of fertility and interpret the will of god through the heavenly> portents. The priests, thus established in a position of power, began, as do> the members of all professions similarly placed, to extend their influence and> activities and to make demands on the population for sacrificial offering.96 Not all sites on the Grid, however, were places where human sacrifice waspracticed. This emerges in specific cultures — most famously in Meso-Americawith the Aztecs, as Michell mentions — and for specific reasons as will be seenin a subsequent chapter. For the moment it is important to note that thosereasons may have something to do with the alchemical nature of the Grid itself,and what human sacrifice may have been designed, or at least, perceived by some,to do. The clue is provided by Michell’s insight that the purpose of such apractice was magical and necromantic, that is, it was designed to manipulate, orintensify, whatever forces the Grid itself tapped into.c. Number, Measurement, and Time: The Grimoire of the Cosmos Michell, like Munck, sees the key to the Grid system to lie not only in itsastronomical alignments, but also in the numbers incorporated into each site’slocation, and in the dimensions of the structures built on them. And like Munckand many other Grid researchers, he jettisons the metric system as being of anyutility whatsoever for understanding these structures:> Modern students of ancient metrology, or units of measure, have been hampered> by their use of the irrelevant metric system in their researches. The French> metre is a modern contrivance of the late eighteenth century, based on an> inaccurately measured quarter of the earth’s circumference through the poles,> of which the metre was made a ten-millionth part. This new-fangled unit bears> no relation to any ancient unit, and by using it for antiquarian research> modern scholars have concealed from themselves the key to the elucidation of> ancient metrology. The key is in number. All the ancient units relate to each> other, and to the dimensions of the earth, by the same code of number as is> found in every other ancient form of art and science.97 Note carefully what is being implied here: the ancient units of measure arederived from the earth, these in turn give rise to certain recurrent numbers,present in the dimensions of the Grid structures only if one used some form ofancient measure. And more importantly, these same numbers are “found in everyother ancient form of art and science,” namely in the numbers hidden by gematriain texts.Succinctly stated, Michell is saying that texts are architecture, andarchitecture is text¸ and that when certain numbers are found, the purpose ofboth is alchemical in that the ultimate purpose is the manipulation of thephysical medium — the Philosophers’ Stone — itself.98A review — necessarily short — of Michell’s research on number and measure willshow why this is so. One of the first points to be observed is that the Englishimperial, Roman, and Greek units of the measurement of length are all related toeach other in the ratio of 24:25. Thus, > 1) 24 English miles of 5280 feet equal 25 Greek miles of 5068.8 feet; and in> turn,> 2) 24 Greek miles of 5068.8 feet equal 25 Roman miles of 4866.048 feet.99If one divides the Greek and Roman miles by 5000, one obtains the measures ofthe Greek and Roman foot, and 6000 Greek feet and 6250 Roman feet in turncomprise “one minute of a degree of latitude.”100 When the meridiancircumference of the Earth — 24,883.2 miles — is measured by the Roman and Greekunits, some very interesting numbers begin to occur, for that measure convertsto: > 135,000,000 Roman feet of .09732096 ft.> 90,000,000 Roman cubits of 1.4598144 ft.> 216,000 Roman furlongs of 608.256 ft.> 27,000 Roman miles of 4866.048 ft.> 129,600,000 Greek feet of 1.10376 ft.> 84,400,000 Greek cubits of 1.152064 ft.> 207,360 Greek furlnogs of 633.6 ft.> 25, 920 Greek miles of 5068.8 ft.101But that is not all; Michell observes that, “All these multiples are canonicalnumbers, representing powers and multiples of the number twelve.”102 Or putdifferently, all are multiples of the number six and sixty, the basis of theancient Sumerian sexagesimal system of measures and numbers. Note also that thelast number — 25,920 — is close to the amount of time for the precession of theequinoxes of the Earth to complete one revolution.These numbers, essentially all multiples of six, composed a numerical canon that“was once possessed by civilizations world-wide”103 as a kind of universalnumerical “grimoire.” For example, one such number, 5040, is divisible not onlyby six, but by all other numbers up to ten, and is moreover a peculiar number inanother way, for 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 = 5040 = 7 × 8 × 9 × 10.104 That bitof arithmetical magic would not be so extraordinary in and of itself, except forthe fact that its harmonic, 50.4 feet, is the mean diameter of the lintel ringat Stonehenge, which incorporates many more such numbers into the dimensions ofthe structure.105While it is tempting to get lost in these numerical excursions, the importantpoint to bear in mind is that since most structures on the world Grid embodymany of these numbers in their dimensions in a kind of “architectural gematria,”the implication is rather obvious, namely, that “the ancient philosophers wereconcerned above all to seek out the patterns in number which correspond to thosein nature, and to set them up as models in the conduct of human affairs.”106However, since these numbers were viewed as cosmological processes, componentsof the great machine of the heavens, there was another purpose for embodyingthem in structures:> In the design of temples, to give human satisfaction was only one part of the> architect’s purpose. The chief object for which a temple was built was to> attract the gods or forces in nature to which it was dedicated. This was done> by the use of the principle of sympathetic resonance or ‘like attracts like’.> Each temple was so framed as to include symbolic reference to the appropriate> deity. It was oriented according to the season and the heavenly body> corresponding to that deity, whose characteristic numbers were also expressed> in the dimensions of the building. Certain patterns of number, each with> corresponding musical and geometric types, represented certain aspects of> universal energy.107 It is important once again to pause and reflect on what Michell is reallyimplying here, given its context in the wider alchemical context of “as above,so below,” for this means that such architecture was a direct attempt — if onemay be permitted to employ the modern physics term for “sympathetic resonance”and “sympathetic magic” — to construct coupled harmonic oscillators capable ofmanipulating the physical medium itself.We have come a long and winding trail from the first tests of hydrogen bombswith their anomalously high yields, through the glimmers of a political geomancypracticed by Nazis and other researchers into the Grid system, through aprofoundly sophisticated “topological metaphor” of the primordial“masculine-adrogyous trinity” at Angkor Wat and various ancient texts, andfinally to the beginning glimpses of an alchemical architecture on a trulyglobal scale, an architecture encompassing numbers recurrent across the globe,an architecture that summons the image of modern man living inside a vast ruinedmachine of great antiquity. We have seen, too, the first stirrings of somethingdark and sinister in the form of bloody sacrifice hanging over some of thisproject. This program was so large, and so old, that one cannot help butentertain that this whole process was the product of some elite coordinating theproject.In the remaining chapters of this book, we will explore those cultures that saidthe most about numbers and music, that are so self-evidently identified withpyramids and antiquity, and that are even identified with human sacrifice. Inshort, we will focus our attention on the ancient sites of Central and SouthAmerica, on Mesopotamia, and of course, on the center of it all, Egypt, to seeif we can peel back the layers of this machine, and to see if, lurkingunderneath, there may be the suggestions of a profoundly sophisticated, and allbut lost, physics and technology of the manipulation of the medium and ofconsciousness.Before we do so, however, a more detailed review of what we have encountered inprevious chapters is in order.

The clues that we haveencountered are vast and different, and seemingly unrelated, but as we shall nowsee in this review, there is a common conception underlying them all.> 1) Anomalous Yields from Early Hydrogen Bomb Tests revealed that the> supposedly unaccounted-for fusion reactions of lithium-7 were the> publicly-stated reasons for the enormous yield of the Castle Bravo test, which> far exceeded the predicted yield. However, two facts revealed that this public> explanation was probably a cover-up for something else: > a) the first hydrogen bomb test, “Mike”, was not fueled by any lithium> component at all, thus rendering the lithium-7 explanation of its anomalous> yield inapplicable in this case; and, > b) the lithium-7 reaction was known prior to the Castle Bravo test, both by> the Argentine physicist José Balseiro, and to the Nazi physicist, Dr. Ronald> Richter, who was relying upon that very lithium-7 reaction in his so-called> fusion experiments in Argentina. > c) Further examination of Dr. Richter’s project and his own statements made> later in personal interviews to the U.S.Air Force revealed that he believed> that rotating plasmas functioned as transducers — as “gates” — of the zero> point energy, or of the energy of the fabric of space-time itself. Reduced to> its simplest form, this means that any rotating mass of a non-linear medium> can act as a transducer of the energy present in the local geometric> configuration of space-time, which, by the nature of the case, is> ever-changing; > d) Thus it was speculated that any slight deviation from perfect symmetrical> compression of an atomic core could conceivably introduce a minute rotation or> torque into the plasma of a nuclear explosion, thus making it function as a> gate or transducer, for a brief moment of time, of the local geometry of> space-time, which is, of course, variable over time and dependent on the> relative positions of celestial bodies; > e) This view was corroborated by the existence of the work of Dr. Nikolai> Kozyrev in the Soviet Union, who noticed similar effects in the sun itself — a> large rotating ball of plasma — and posited that these were due to the> functions of time itself playing into the thermonuclear reactions of the sun; > f) Thus, the celestial machine with its component bodies functions in itself> as a kind of a grid system, which is mirrored on the Earth by the placement of> structures deliberately aligned with celestial markers.

With respect to the ancient systems of measure,> it was seen that most Grid researchers are aware of the importance, and> ancientness, of the British imperial system as well as of other ancient> systems of measure for obtaining the numerical values connecting grid sites.> It was also seen that the Greek, Roman, and British imperial measures were> related to each other in the precise mathematical ratio of 24:25, yielding> numerical coefficients of geodetic measurements that were based on a Sumerian> sexagesimal system. Many of these numbers in turn are gematrian numbers which> can be substituted for letters in ancient texts. This suggested that one was> looking at a combined system of texts and monuments that both made use of the> same systems of “sacred numbers.” > 4) The Grid and the Social Engineering of Power and Consciousness was also> implied, not only directly by Michell with frequent allusions to the need to> “find the center” of a region, but also in the regalia of royalty that> suggested the “cosmic axis”, such as the scepter. For Michell, the Grid was> intended in some sense as a manipulation of consciousness, as the social> engineering of society done in deliberate reflection of the celestial machine> that the Grid was designed to emulate. > 5) Bloody, and Human, Sacrifices were also associated with some aspects and> sites on the world Grid — one need only think of the blood and gore of the> Meso-American sites — but not with all of them. As noted, Michell suspected> that this was due to the concept that somehow such sacrifices were able to> intensify the magical manipulation of whatever forces the ancients thought to> be involved at the site. It was thus implied that the technology of such sites> itself, which we have argued was for the ultimate purpose of the manipulation> of the physical medium itself, may also have been involved in the manipulation> of consciousness, and sacrifice was somehow a means to this end, though in> ways we have yet to examine. > 6) Medium Manipulation, Consciousness Manipulation, the Topological Metaphor,> and the Implications: We saw also that contained within certain ancient> cosmologies and texts was a “topological metaphor” that led to a primary> initial “differentiation” creating a primordial “masculine-adrogynous”> trinitarian or triadic structure — as in the metaphor of Vishnu’s tripartite> manifestation — of two differentiated regions in the physical medium, plus> their common shared surface. This led to the view that the physical medium, in> the ancient view, was a transmutative medium that created information,> information that was analogical in its structure due to the fact that all> differentiations derived from their common substrate. This “analogical> structure” and metaphor suggests that on the ancient view there was a common> understanding both of the physical medium and of consciousness, and a deep> physics underlying the two. In the coming chapters, we will attempt to unfold this deep relationship and itsrelationship to the Grid system and some of its monuments, with a view tofurther understanding of their, and its, possible designed purpose and function.In the course of this examination, we will have occasion to briefly suggest thepossible reasons for human sacrifices, originating in a perverted understandingof the physical medium and its relationship to consciousness.1 John Michell, Secrets of the Stones, p. 117.2 It is important to understand what is being said here. The lithium-7explanation for the anomalous yields of the Castle Bravo test do make sense, butpossibly do not account for all the anomalous yield. The mere fact that thereaction was known prior to the test makes it unlikely that such an obviouscomponent of fusion reactions was overlooked by American nuclear engineers. Theexchange between Drs. Balseiro and Richter in Argentina, in other words, cast anaura of suspicion over the official Castle Bravo explanation."},{"pageContent":"PART TWO:THE MESO- AND SOUTH-AMERICAN“PYRAMID PEOPLES” “Again there comes a humiliation, destruction, and demolition.

The first, andoldest of these, features large stones with irregular cuts, so precisely joinedtogether, without mortar, that knife blades cannot be inserted into the cracks.The most famous of these is a twelve-sided stone with such irregular cuts as todefy the imagination, yet, it is fitted perfectly to all the surrounding stones.image [images/00037.jpg] The Twelve-Sided Stone in an Ancient Wall near Cuzco.2 Note that all of the stones seen in the above picture are joined togetherwithout mortar, and the twelve-sided stone implies a measure of technologicalsophistication to even cut and fit the stone so precisely with the surroundingblocks. Oftentimes these cyclopean structures are topped with a later layer ofconstruction made according to a more traditional “rectangular brick and mortar”approach typical of Incan construction.But why would an earlier culture construct walls in such a complex way? Oneanswer, given by engineers, is that in earthquake-prone Peru, the cavitation ofan earthquake would certainly shake the walls, but, given the irregularity ofmany of the stone blocks in these walls, the stones would simply fall more orless back into their original position and the wall would remain intact. Thelater layers of Incan construction, built according to more conventional models,do not fare so well.Similar construction principles are found elsewhere in the world, as, forexample, in the Gate of the Nekromonteion near the ancient city of Ephyra.image [images/00038.jpg] The Gate of the Nekromonteion in Greece Again, the stones are irregularly cut and joined so precisely, that thestructure, like the walls in Peru, has survived for centuries in spite of themany earthquakes in the region.A. The Riddle of Sacsayhuaman1. Indicators of Advanced Machining Technology A closer look at the walls near Cuzco — at a place called Sacsayhuaman — are inorder to see precisely how intricate this method of construction could be.Indeed, so intricate is it that the sixteenth century Spanish chronicler,Garcilaso de la Vega, described his own shock at discovering the wall, and hisdeeper shock over its implications:> Its proportions are inconceivable when one has not actually seen it; and when> one has looked at it closely and examined it attentively, they appear to be so> extraordinary that it seems as though some magic had presided over its It…> construction is made of such (enormous) stones, and in such great number, that> one wonders simultaneously how the Indians were able to quarry them, how they> transported them, and how they hewed them and set them on top of one another…> They are so well fitted together that you could not slip the point of a knife> between two of them. If we think, too, that this incredible work was> accomplished without the help of a single machine… how may we explain the fact> that these Peruvian Indians were able to split, carve, lift, carry, hoist and> lower such enormous blocks of stone, which are more like pieces of a mountain> than building stones? Is it too much to say that it represents an even greater> enigma than the seven wonders of the world?3A glance at a picture will demonstrate the enormity of the mystery, one that hasnot cleared up in the centuries between de la Vega’s observations and thepresent.image [images/00039.jpg] The Irregular Cut Stones of the Wall of Sacsayhuaman It is intriguing to note that the notion of machining these massive andirregularly cut stones did not originate in late nineteenth or twentieth century“pseudo-archaeology,” the favorite term of the academically-blinded, for de laVega’s observations were made in the sixteenth century, and even then, theimplications were obvious and apparent. Indeed, one scientist calculated theweight of one of the enormous stone blocks in the wall and concluded it weighedapproximately 355 tons, one of the heaviest such cut stones in the world,4 andexceeded in weight only by some of the truly gigantic stones of Baalbek inLebanon.Conventional archaeological theory here as elsewhere seems unable, or afraid, toconfront the obvious, and attributes these huge constructions to the Incas, who,it maintains, used a “trial and error” approach in cutting and then fittingthese stones together so snugly. But having stated this nonsensical position,conventional archaeological theory admits that the Incas, for some inexplicablereason — just as the Egyptians — left no records nor even maintained anytraditions about the construction of these huge walls!5 As Hancock and Faiiapoint out, the only record of the Incas even attempting to move such a hugestone, recorded once again in de la Vega’s Royal Commentaries of the Incas,“suggests that they had no experience of the techniques involved — since theattempt ended in disaster.”6And there is one final, highly significant, fact to be noted about Sacsayhuaman,and that is, that the Inca name means, quite literally, “Satisfied Falcon.”This, notes Hancock and Faiia, connects the site to the unlikely place of Egyptin a more direct way, since the name “Falcon” is a name of Horus, and suggeststhe secret “mystery school” or elite of Egypt, the Shemsu-Hor, the Followers ofHorus.72.The Incas, the Grid, and Human Sacrifice The scholar William Sullivan noted that, just as in the Old World, the ancientsites of the New World were used to convey complex astronomical information, ina “language of sacred revelation grounded in empirical observation,”8 but likethe Aztecs, the Incas, according to Sullivan, took the symbolism of the heavenlymachine, and the individual person’s ascent to it after death, literally, andthus were led “into the dark hell of black magic and human sacrifice.”9 In theIncas’ case, these sacrifices were always offered along the system of theirstraight roads, roads that were laid out in the customary design of makingstructures on Earth correspond to celestial constellations,10 the magical powerthus conjured being concentrated at the place of sacrifice and “transmitted”throughout the empire by means of those roads and “ley lines.”The contrast is acute and compelling, and again, raises the central mystery:> In Mexico and the Andes astronomically aligned, pyramidal monuments were used> as part of the apparatus of sacrifice. In Egypt and Angkor astronomically> aligned pyramidal monuments were used as part of a gnostic quest for> immortality.11In other words, from one and the same mythological cosmology, two entirelydifferent practices subsequently emerged. This is a crucial point, and we shallhave occasion to return to it in a later chapter, but for the present moment, itis important to understand the significance of this point, for if the ancientcosmology examined in conjunction with Angkor Wat and some ancient texts(examined in chapter three) conceals a sophisticated topological metaphor of thephysical medium, whose principal property is the creation of information via an“analogical process,” then the implication is that,in the ancient view, there isa direct relationship between consciousness and that physical medium. It is thisdirect relationship that leads to the subsequent divergence of the religiouspractices — one contemplative, the other very murderous and brutal — inconnection with it.3.The “Aerial” Mysteries: The Transition to the Heart of the South AmericanRiddle There are other mysteries, equally imponderable, to be found in Peru.The famous Nazca Lines in Peru, for example, are only visible from the air:image [images/00040.jpg] Part of the Nazca Lines in Peru. Note the Straightness of the Lines This has led some in the “ancient astronauts” school to propose that the lineswere direction markers in some ancient “spaceport.” But then, how does oneexplain these parts of the Nazca Lines, also only visible from the air?image [images/00041.jpg] Nazca Lines in Peru with the Famous “Hummingbird” Glyph More recent investigations have shown many of these glyphs, the “Spider”(notshown) and the “Hummingbird” to be configured, once again, to certainastronomical alignments.Turning south from Peru towards Bolivia, the area surrounding Tiahuanaco is evenstranger, for there the system of straight “ley lines” is even more in evidencefrom an aerial view of the Aymara Indian country surrounding Lake Titicaca, thesite of Tiahuanaco.image [images/00042.jpg] Straight Ley Line System in Aymara Indian Country in Bolivia, Near LakeTiticaca. And this brings us to the strangest ancient site in South America, and perhapseven the strangest of all sites on the world Grid, Lake Titicaca, and thecurious ruins of Tiahuanaco and Puma Punkhu.B. Tiahuanaco and the Puma Punkhu Paradox: Ancient Machining No one visiting Tiahuanaco and Puma Punkhu can come away with anything less thanawe and puzzlement, for there, amid the ruins of what was clearly an ancientcity, high in the thin air of the lake, are the great stone remains of acivilization that clearly possessed an advanced technology able to machine theintricately cut stones. As we shall see, the presence of such clear evidence fora sophisticated stone-working technology raises in a clear fashion thepossibility that one is looking at the debris of a very ancient civilization,remains that have led many to question the whole standard history and model ofhow mankind came to the South and North American continents.Just a glance at some of these will demonstrate this point better than any wordscould possibly do.image [images/00043.jpg] Intricate Stone Cutting at Tiahuanaco12 More than any other of the huge stones at Tiahuanaco, the so-called “H Blocks” —huge stones intricately cut — testify to the existence of some sort oftechnology, to the existence of some sort of advanced ancient machiningtechnology:image [images/00044.jpg] Trapezoidal Cuts in an “H-Block” at Tiahuanaco13 And not far away, at Puma Punkhu, are the famous “H-Blocks” themselves: image [images/00045.jpg] “H-Block” at Puma Punkhu,14 image [images/00046.jpg] Twin “H-Blocks” at Puma Punku15 When engineers carefully examined these huge, finely-cut blocks, they discoveredsomething else: the cuts were so placed on each block that the bocks were meantto be joined together, as if they were three-dimensional pieces of an intricatejigsaw puzzle.image [images/00047.jpg] Artist’s Rendition of the Joining of the H-Blocks16 The mystery only deepens, the closer one looks, and one researcher who did takea closer look was my friend and colleague in alternative research, IgorWitkowski.Best known for his truly magisterial research in the field of Nazi technology,The Truth About the Wunderwaffe,17 Witkowski turned his investigative talents tothe question of human origins in the Americas in a fascinating study, Axis ofthe World: The Search for the Oldest American Civilization, a work we shallfollow closely in this chapter, for Witkowski’s conclusions are nothing lessthan stunning, and his book also makes available for the first time in theEnglish language some of the investigations into these mysteries undertaken inEastern Europe.1. The Heart of All South American Mysteries Witkowski justifiably calls Tiahuanaco and Puma Punkhu “the heart of all theSouth American and Transpacific mysteries.”18 We shall see presently why he saysthat it is at the heart of the “Transpacific” mysteries. As has already beenseen with the pictures of the elaborate stone-work of Tiahuanaco and PumaPunkhu, however, the site “is a perfect illustration of a certain ‘challenge’ toall the theories, namely that it experienced a period of uncanny technologicalprogress, followed by an equally unexplainable period of deterioration,”19 for“the precision of stonecutting visible here and the level of its complexity areevident remains of some technological civilization’s activity.”20This problem is compounded by Tiahuanaco’s and Puma Punkhu’s location at LakeTiticaca in Bolivia, at an altitude of nearly 10,000 feet above sea level, analtitude of such thin air that only the nearby Aymara Indians are accustomed tobreathing and working in it; for Europeans such as Witkowski, the effort oftenproduces nosebleeds, exhaustian, and pre-heart attack symptoms.21 How could sucha technologically sophisticated civilization emerge or settle in such an extremeplace?The problem is further compounded by the fact that the gigantic machined stonesof Puma Punkhu are scattered chaotically over the site, as if smashed by someheavy hand of destruction.22 To Wiktkowski, when one considered all the varioussites evident in South America and the varying degrees of technologicalsophistication they exhibited, it was evident that the most recent Inca periodwas the least sophisticated. The further back one went, the more the evidencesuggested that the technology itself was far superior in remotest times, thanmore recent ones. This suggested something of great significance for thechronological development of the South American civilizations to Witkowski, whenone compared the great technological sophistication of Puma Punkhu, to the lesssophisticated level of technology evidenced by nearby Tiahuanaco:> Looking at the site we have the overwhelming impression that we deal here with> a backward development from an advanced, sophisticated technology in the> remote past, through a moderately developed technology in nearer history, up> to its almost complete atrophy presently.When taking into account modern construction achievements, we face the truththat many of the construction methods that were applied in Puma Punkhu haveabsolutely no equivalent anywhere else in the world and would even be hard toreproduce in our time.23 In other words, we have the following broad outlines of a tripartite structureof chronological and technological development:> 1) The most sophisticated technological evidence, stretching back to “High> Antiquity”; > 2) A less sophisticated layer of technological development, stretching back to> “antiquity”; and, > 3) The least sophisticated layer of technological development, comprising the> known civilization of South America, the Incas. This broad, tripartite chronological pattern is quite the crucial point, for weshall be returning to it later in this chapter in connection withthe actualdating of Tiahuanaco, but also in subsequent chapters when we consider thedating of places such as Teotihuacan in Mexico, and most importantly, Giza inEgypt.24Witkowski outlines the complexity of attempting to machine the H Blocks andother stones found at Puma Punkhu, and just how precise the machined tolerancesof these blocks really is:> A serial stonecutting of the blocks (of very hard andesite) was applied,> characterized by a precision hardly achievable today! I cannot imagine a> contemporary designer who would propose to build some large object of> megalithic blocks having such complex shapes, reproduced with a precision of> the order of one tenth of a millimeter (which is roughly the thickness of this> sheet of paper), while the convex edges, formed by merging surfaces made with> such a precision were to correspond with analogous concave two- or> three-dimensional edges of other blocks. Such a designer would have to be> crazy! But such precision can be found at Puma Punkhu!The cutting machines currently in use (millers, for example) with rotating toolsdo not enable us to make such sharp concave edges, and in particular such sharpthree dimensional concave corners merging three perpendicular surfaces — not tomention the serial production of them! Such a technology simply does not exist.You can make a precise surface and polish it, or connect two such surfaces witha convex or concave edge, but it would be quite a challenge to connect threesuch surfaces and create a 90o concave corner, still keeping the 0.1mm precisiontolerance in the very corner!25 But such precise tolerances are not the only technological problem posed by PumaPunkhu.The other problem posed by the H Blocks is that they have “almost 80 surfaceseach!” Witkowski quips — not inaccurately — “I suspect that a contemporaryengineer could not even imagine designing them without a computer.”26 ForWitkowski, the mere presence of such technological sophistication, in additionto a globally aligned system of sites, constitutes “a very serious challenge” toconventional academic views of the evolution of human civilization. Indeed, thecontemporary historical, archaeological, and anthropological sciences seemutterly unwilling even to consider the facts.27And let us note one final thing by way of a question: why would one need such analmost optical precision in the H Blocks? Such precision by the nature of thecase implies that it served some functional purpose, as in a machine.2. The Traditions Concerning Tiahuanaco However, in order to fully appreciate the deep significance and implications ofPuma Punkhu, we must now turn our attentions to the second site at LakeTiticaca, and to the second, later and intermediate layer of technologicalevidence and chronological progression: Tiahuanaco. Here, interestingly enough,we discover many of the traditions that we found associated with megalithicsites elsewhere in the world.The first of these is evident by the ancient name for Tiahuanaco: Taypicala. Notsurprisingly, this means “the Stone at the Centre,”28 giving yet anotherinstance of the ancient “geomantic” practice of finding the center of a region.Indeed, the Inca tradition itself recognized that the ancient name of Tiahuanacomeant the Stone at the Center of the world.29Even more interesting is the fact that when the first Spanish explorers arrivedin the region and asked the local Aymara Indians if the structures at Tiahuanacoand Puma Punkhu had been built by the Incas, they were greeted with laughter.The Aymara explained that their ancestral tradition stated that the structureswere built “long before the Inca reign” and that they had literally been builtvery suddenly, in the span of one night!30 More interesting still, the site wasalso said to have been built by the first creations of the sun-god, Viracocha,who created a race of giants, who were later overthrown by a worldwide delugewhen they had displeased him.31 This is, of course, not the first time we haveencountered such traditions concerning these cyclopean megalithic structures,for we have already encountered similar traditions already with respect toStonehenge in England, Baalbek in Lebanon, and even stone circles in Africa.The sun-god Viracocha requires a closer look, for once again, as in the case ofVishnu, the symbolism surrounding this god is multi- layered, and indicative ofa possible deeper physics, though it should be made clear that, just as Vishnu,Viracocha is also manifested and precisely described in the Andean traditions asa bearded, blue-eyed white man of large stature, and the giver of civilizationto the Incas, just as we shall discover Quetzcoatl to be when we turn northwardto Mexico.32As the sun-god, however, Viracocha like Atum in Egypt and Vishnu in India andIndochina, was the great self-generative power in, and of, the cosmos.33 He iscarved above the well-known “Gate of the Sun” at Tiahuanaco:image [images/00048.jpg] Viracocha’s Image on the Gate of the Sun at Tiahuanaco? 3. The Image of Vicacocha: A Schematic of a Technology? There is something peculiar about this image, and it has haunted me ever since Ifirst became aware of it many years ago. In The Giza Death Star, I observed theresemblance of this highly-stylized image to the schematic of a three-stagefission-fusion-fission hydrogen bomb.34 Let us recall the schematic of such abomb from chapter one, and compare itto the image:image [images/00049.jpg] Comparison of Three Stage Hydrogen Bomb Schematic with Viracocha Of course, such comparisons are suggestive, if not fanciful, but they do giveone pause especially considering that Viracocha was a sun-god. Even moresuggestive is what happens when one rotates the Viracocha image 180 degrees onits vertical axis:image [images/00050.jpg] Viracocha Image Rotated 180o on its Vertical Axis Upside-down, one cannot avoid the vague impression of the outlines of a bomb.While such comparisons may be fanciful, there is a further tradition surroundingViracocha that suggests that the comparison to modern technologies might not,indeed, be so questionable, and that is that Viracocha ushers in five newepochs, each one being heralded by a “new sun”, each epoch being called apachacuti. This word signifies a literal “‘overturning of the world’ (accordingto Sir Clements Markham’s translation), and an ‘overturning of space-time’according to William Sullivan.”35 In other words, if one accepts the hypothesisthat the anomalous yields of early h-bomb tests were in part the result ofgating of energies from the variable conditions of the geometry of localcelestial space-time, the peculiar resemblance of the Viracocha image at the SunGate at Tiahuanaco to such devices, and the traditions of such over-turnings ofspace-time in the epochs or world ages that Viracocha destroys and thenre-creates (one recalls Vishnu’s similar role), then the comparison may not beall that fanciful.4. Traditions Connected Half a World Away There is one final tradition concerning Viracocha that is also worth mentioning,for it illustrates yet another very bizarre and unusual connection withtraditions half a world away in Mesopotamia, for there are traditions which hailthe engineering accomplishments of Viracocha and his companions, who are called,suggestively, “messengers,” and “the shining ones.”36 If this sounds vaguelyfamiliar, it should, this precise term, “the shining ones,” was also used insome ancient Mesopotamian texts to describe the Annunaki, the Watchers, the raceof “gods” that came to earth and, in some readings of the stories, helped toengineer the human race itself. They were thus designated because of theluminous character of their faces.37As if this was not enough, there is another strange connection between thetraditions of the Incas in the New World, and those of the Old World, for theIncas believed that the soul ascending to heaven after death was accompanied byblack dogs, and in Egypt, the soul’s ascension was accompanied by Anubis andUpuaut, symbolized by black dogs.385. The Difficulty of Dating Tiahuanaco Conventional and standard archaeological dating of Tiahuanaco is unusuallydivided over the date of the site, assigning a terminus ante quem to the secondmillennium BC, and a terminus post quem to as late as the ninth century AD.39All standard archaeological models of Tiahuanaco are, however, agreed that thesite has nothing to do with the Incas.40 Even on the early dating of Tiahuanacoby conventional archaeology, this would make the site older than the Mayan ruinsof Meso-America, and far older than the Inca empire.41But these termini ante et post quem have always been challenged, even as earlyas the nineteenth century, by amateur archaeologists who have pointed out anumber of problems even for the earliest dating. The French archaeologist LePlongeon, for example, uncovered a layer of seashells after making somesuperficial excavations at the site, suggesting that it was once a seaport. Heconcluded from this that the site may have been antediluvian, a suggestion,notes Witkowski, that “turned out to be surprisingly long- lived.”42 Thisfinding was echoed in the early twentieth century by the German-American ArthurPoznansky, who wrestled with the riddle of Tiahuanaco for almost thirty years.43Poznansky’s reasons for this conclusion derived from his mapping of the site’sbarely-visible remaining canals, leading him to conclude the city had once beensurrounded by the lake, and the shoreline higher.44However, this method of dating by the level of the shoreline soon compounded thedifficulty, and the mystery, of the entire Tiahuanaco-Puma Punkhu complex. Whenone examines the entire vicinity of the sites, there are clear indications that“the end of the ‘Golden Era’ must have had a rather sudden character,” forscattered about it, “there were numerous large stone blocks just abandoned invarious phases of cutting.”45 This was not the only indicator of suddendestruction, nor was it the only problem.> The old shoreline was also clearly visible, as if the change came almost> overnight. It was plotted on a map and with this came the first surprise It> turned out that the old shoreline was significantly inclined to the present> level… in the scale of the entire lake the difference amounts to around 1000> feet… It appeared, moreover, that the old coastline doesn’t form a closed> loop, but is open on the south; it simply ends, some distance from the ruins.> It other words, had the lake’s surface been that much higher, its waters would> have spilled over the southern part of the altiplano, towards Lake Poopo;> there was no natural barrier. But there must have been something! The only> reasonable explanation in this situation was that there must have been a> glacier, which could stop the waters. No one knew how long ago such conditions> existed, but it was a kind of confirmation that the ruins were indeed quite> old.46The circumstantial evidence for a glaciers was not the only thing pointed toTiahuanaco’s “extreme antiquity,” for also found on the Gate of the Sun — theGate with the image of Viracocha discussed above — are the representations ofelephant heads. And yet another relief at Tiahuanaco shows “quite clearbas-reliefs of mastodons.”47 The youngest known fossils of mastodons in SouthAmerica are some 10,400 years old.48To make the dating of the site even more difficult, radiocarbon dating placesthe site to about 1500BC!49So on the one hand, the geological and indirect evidence points to a site ofgreat antiquity, to the period of the end of the last Ice Age and to a periodwhen the last mastodons were known in the region, that is, to a period of ca.10,500 BC (there’s that date again!), while the radiocarbon dating points tosomething much more recent, and hence, becomes the terminus ante quem forconventional archaeology. Before considering an extremely speculative resolutionof this difficulty, however, it is worth looking at more recent moves withinconventional archaeology to redate the site to a far earlier period than 1500BC.This shift began in ca. 1996–1997 when Dr. Oswaldo Rivera, the Director ofBolivia’s National Institute of Archaeology, and “one of the world’s leadingexperts on Tiahuanaco,”50 made an announcement confirming his belief that thesite was some 12,000 years old.51Moreover, this new dating was based on an examination of existing structures atthe site. But Rivero went on to explain that there was in all likelihood anotherTiahuanaco buried beneath the present ruins.52The implications of all this were and are enormous, for this means that ifTiahuanaco is some 12,000 years old, then Puma Punkhu is even older than that!6. Back to the Technology of Puma Punkhu So we return to Puma Punkhu, to observe even more mystifying evidence ofadvanced technological machining, bearing in mind we are now looking at atechnology in use before Tiahuanaco.> Examination of the blocks reveals also the use of one more unconventional> technology. In some places one can observe groups (usually rows) of very> precisely made holes. The precision is so great that it rules out manual> processing. First and foremost, they generally have exactly the same diameter,> the sides are very smooth (if the holes are not damaged, of course) and> precisely parallel. The deviations in this respect — i.e., differences of the> diameter between the top and the bottom of the hole — are on the order of 0.1> mm. This corresponds with drilling by a machine fixed on some mount, for it> could not be done by holding the tool in one’s hands, especially working a> very hard stone.53The evidence of such technology is, indeed, overwhelming, but Witkowski isacutely aware that there is a type of “scholarship” that balks at concluding theobvious, and that proposes ludicrous alternative theories. Witkowski’s proposedmethod of persuading them of the error of their thinking is somewhat novel:> From skeptical scientists, the “debunkers,” we often hear that all the wonders> of prehistoric construction were accomplished only (by) very simple stone or> copper hand tools, accessible to primitive peoples. I would propose to chain> such a scholar to a comparatively hard and large stone block, along with such> primitive tools, until he turned it into a block such as one just described.54Worse yet, Witkowski made a series of very exact measurements of the dimensionsincorporated into the various surfaces of the H Blocks, and discovered, to hisastonishment, that many of them incorporated a significant number: 3.1418,differing only from the ideal of π by .0002!55As if that were not enough, other recurring measures resulted in values thatwere exactly one fourth of the Sumerian unit of measure, the “ell”.56There is a final thing testifying to the high technology surrounding PumaPunkhu, and this time it comes from Andean tradition itself, and in it, we seethe glimmer, perhaps, of a solution to the radiocarbon dating which was at suchodds with the geological and indirect evidence for its antiquity. According tothose legends, Puma Punkhu, with its large precisely-cut multi-faced stoneblocks — some of which were simply abandoned in the middle of machining, as ifsome sudden catastrophe had overtaken the site — was “destroyed by Viracochawith ‘deadly rays’ before the deluge.”57In other words, its destruction was deliberate and accomplished by means of atechnology, and with an apparent suddenness. One is, perhaps, looking at theSouth American version of some primordial “Tower of Babel Moment,” when whateverwas being constructed there was perceived as a threat to someone else, whointervened, and ended the project.Moreover, the type of technology is even suggested by those legends; it was atechnology involving electromagnetic radiation. Exposure to concentratedradiation would, indeed, massively distort radiocarbon dating efforts, makingold things appear far younger than they actually were.Maybe the comparison of the image of Viracocha on the Sun Gate at Tiahuanacowith a modern three-stage hydrogen bomb is not so fanciful after all.C. The Axis of the World Across the Pacific1. The Mystery of Easter Island For the careful reader familiar with standard explanations of how mankind cameto the Americas — the celebrated “land bridge” across the Bering Strait fromSiberia to Alaska — the paradox of Puma Punkhu raises significant difficulties.Those difficulties are massively compounded when one considers the context ofTiahuanaco and Puma Punkhu within the context of the Grid system that stretchesfrom South America, across the Pacific — in nearly a straight line as we shallsee, or what Witkowski calls “the Axis of the World” — to the Indiansubcontinent.We have seen how local traditions concerning Puma Punkhu and Tiahuanaco conjointwo things: (1) a sudden and deliberate destruction by the means of an impliedtechnology and an implied act of war, and (2) a subsequent catastrophe in theform of a flood.One finds these two traditions coupled, once again, in the very unlikely placeof Easter Island. There, the flood story is cast in the wider context of a lostland that sank under the sea, never to be seen again:The young man Tea Waka said: — In the old times our land was large, very large. Kuukuu asked him aquestion: — Why it turned small then? Tea Waka replied: — Uwoke has lowered his stick on it. He has lowered his stick on the Ohirotown. Big waves raised and the land became small. It has been namedTe-Pito-o-te-Henua. Uwoke’s stick was broken on the Puku-Puhipuhi mountain.Tea Waka and Kuukuu talked about the Ko-te-Tomonga-o-Tea-Waka village (the placewhere Tea Waka has reached the shore). Then the Hotu Matua king came ashore andsettled on the island. Kuukuu said to him:— Once this land was greater.The friend Tea Waka said:— The land sunk.Then Tea Waka added:— This town is now called Ko-te-Tomonga-o- Tea-Waka.Hotu Matua Asked:— Why the land sunk?— Uwoke did this, he has pushed the land — replied Tea Waka. The land was namedTe-Pito-o-te-Henua. When Uwoke’s stick was long, the land has collapsed into theabyss. Puku-Puhipuhi — that’s how the place where Uwoke’s stick was broken isnow called.— The Hotu Matua king said to Tea Waka:— My friend, it was not Uwoke’s stick. It was the thunder of the Make Makegod.58While at first glance this Easter Island Flood legend might seem rathersimplistic, a closer examination reveals some interesting details that parallelthe Andean legends of Viracocha, the Flood, and the destruction of Puma Punkhuand Tiahuanaco:> 1) The flood is brought about by the deliberate action of a god or gods, in> this case, Uwoke, and Make Make; > 2) Both gods use some sort of technology to do so, Uwoke a “stick,” and Make> Make uses “thunder;” and finally, > 3) Note the association of Uwoke’s stick with a mountain, an unusual> association, for effectively this means we have the association of a god with> a weapon with a mountain. This is a formula that has been seen before, for it> is a formula seen in the ancient epics of Mesopotamia describing an ancient> “cosmic war of the gods,” where the same association of mountains with gods> with pyramids occurs.59 To put it succinctly, one is in the presence, once> again, of more or less the same association and constellation of relationships> in Easter Island, and far-off Mesopotamia. And that means that the loss of> land spoken of in the Easter Island version of the legend somehow fits into> the wider context of a global deluge and a war of the gods. The end result of this technological intervention was the loss of a “large”land. One cannot help but think how closely this legend resembles Plato’sallegory of Atlantis, where, following a devastating war, the fabled continentis overcome by disasters, and sinks into the ocean.That such a legend would arise on such an isolated and small island with almostno resources, such as Easter Island, and that it would so closely parallel —even in its “formula” of associating gods with weapons with mountains —Mesopotamian myths and the Platonic allegory, highlights the problem, for thechances of these specific details arising by mere coincidence is almost nil. Theproblem is further compounded by the fact that Easter Island actually developeda rather sophisticated form of writing, well in advance of anything exhibited ordeveloped in North America, which, if the standard theory of a “land bridge” bywhich the native populations of the Americas came to the continents, spreadingfrom north to south, is true, meant that the northern tribes had far longer atime to develop sophisticated writing. Yet they did not do so, but the EasterIslanders did!60It is in fact this script that demonstrates that the original settlement ofEaster Island was anything but an isolated affair, or that it was disconnectedfrom civilization elsewhere. The connections to “civilization elsewhere” inEaster Island’s case are, however, quite problematical, for the script connectsit to one side of the Pacific, but the construction in evidence on it connectsit to the other.This may most easily be illustrated, again, by pictures of the type of “jigsaw”construction methods that we have already encountered in Peru:image [images/00051.jpg] Stone Wall at Easter Island61 image [images/00052.jpg] Irregular Stone Cuts at Easter Island62 Witkowski points out that there are four distinctive features of theconstructions of these walls on Easter Island that tie them directly to thewalls of Sacsayhuaman, Tiahuanaco, and even the high Andean “Incan” fortress ofMachu Picchu:> 1. The stone blocks are very closely matched to each other, despite rounded,> complex shapes; > 2. They are polygonal; > 3. Their external surfaces are convex; and, > 4. The entire wall is inclined toward the center of the construction.63 All this evidences at least some sort of contact between these far-flung localesin historical times.64Before looking at the script that ties Easter Island to the other side of thePacific, it is worth mentioning that in 1956 the famous explorer andarchaeo-navigator Thor Heyerdahl discovered a statue on Easter Island whollyunlike its more famous moai “Face” statues, in that this one was a bearded manclosely resembling in style similar statues found at Mohenjo Daro in India. Twosimilar specimens were discovered in Bolivia near Tiahuanaco. This is the firstbeginning of some “cracks” in the “land bridge” theory that the Native Americanpopulations migrated across the Bering Strait thousands of years ago, for whatthese connections suggest is rather a migration across the South Pacific.65The most telling evidence for such a connection, however, is the aforementionedscript of Easter Island, the Rongo Rongo writing.image [images/00053.jpg] Rongo Rongo Script of Easter Island66 Witkowski notes that his fellow countryman, the linguist Professor Benon Z.Szalek of the University of Szczecin, made a detailed study and comparison ofthe Rongo Rongo script with the writing of the Indus Valley civilization inIndia, the civilization centered around the mysterious ruins of Mohenjo Daro:image [images/00054.jpg] Comparison of Rongo Rongo Script to that of the Indus Valley67 Compounding the difficulty that this astonishing resemblance represents is thefact that the Indus Valley-Mohenjo Daro civilization disappeared ca. 1000–1200years BC according to conventional archaeology.> It means that at the moment when Easter Island was inhabited, Mohenjo Daro’s> unique system of writing, its religion, etc.… lived only in human memory. It> (had) been gone for over two millennia (at least according to officially> accepted theories)! It was simply one of the three oldest civilizations on our> planet, along with the Sumerians and the empire of the Pharaohs. Could Easter> Island’s culture reach that deep into the prehistory of mankind? Incidentally,> these circumstances make the Rongo Rongo script the oldest system of writing> in use in historical times, for no less than four thousand years.… In the case> of this chain of traces, the truth seems so obscure, and so strange at the> same time, that one has to ask himself a question: what really happened there,> in the Pacific and Indian Ocean, all those thousands of years ago?68As we shall see in a moment, that question becomes even more peculiar when oneexamines the ruins of Mohenjo Daro themselves, for they afford yet anotherconnection with distant Tiahuanaco and Viracocha, and a very bizarre one atthat.Contributing to this mystery is the fact that Easter Island’s own indigenouspeoples are of apparent Polynesian descent, but their local legends tell of anearlier race of a “long eared” people with “taller skulls, brighter skin, and ofcourse a very different cultural heritage. They spoke a non-Polynesian languageand according to the known tradition, it was they and only they, who knew thesecret of writing.”69 These “long-ears” were, according to local tradition,white skinned and red haired!70 This tradition was confirmed by the firstpermanent European settler on the island, the French priest Eugene Eyraud, whobegan a campaign of burning the wooden tablets containing the Rongo Rongoscript. Eyraud observed that the local natives were not able to read thewriting, confirming the idea that the “long-ears” kept the secret of reading thewriting to themselves.71 According to the islanders’ traditions, “the firstking, Hotu Matua, brought with him 67 most precious tablets from their land oforigin in the west.”72This tradition is very suggestive, for it indicates not only that the EasterIslanders maintained that they came to the Island “from the West,” i.e., acrossthe Pacific, but that part of the purpose may have been to bring pricelessrecords of some sort to the island, and perhaps from thence, elsewhere. In anycase, this tradition is also suggestive of another possible connection to theWest, and to the celebrated Sumerian “Tablets of Destinies,” the terribleobjects of power with which and over which the “gods” fought a tremendous war,upon the conclusion of which, some were destroyed and others were taken“elsewhere.”73If bringing some priceless records was the purpose of the migration to EasterIsland, then there is a sort of logic to it, if the purpose was to prevent suchrecords from falling into the wrong hands by hiding them in a remote place, forone cannot get much more remote than Easter Island.That there was some sort of hidden purpose behind the migration to this remoteand desolate place is evident from the fact that the semi-triangular islanditself covers only about 45 square miles, and from the fact that its hardigneous rock contains little soil suitable for agriculture. Yet, the islandcontains several distinctive and famous statues of heads — the famous Maoi —weighing as little as 10 or as much as 200 tons,74 all of which are facing thecenter of the island in order, according to local legend, to protect the islandfrom sinking into the sea as had happened a previous time in the population’slegends.75 All this, of course, has prompted the question of how such a smallpopulation in such an isolated place could have quarried and then transportedsuch enormous and finely-carved statues.image [images/00055.jpg] Maoi Heads on Easter Island image [images/00056.jpg] Maoi Heads on Easter Island Local legend and tradition does not help much in answering this question, for onEaster Island, just as at various ancient sites on the Grid in Great Britain,the tradition states that the stones moved themselves!There is, however, a clue as to the means of this movement in local tradition,but that clue opens up yet another mysterious connection between Easter Islandand, of all places, Egypt:> …(According) to the legend the stony giants moved “on their own,” to> designated places thanks to the magical power called “mana.” regardless of> whether it’s true or not, it is, however, nonetheless a fact that the same> type of description of motive power emerges in the “second best” place of> archaeological mystery in the Pacific, namely Nan Madol — some 10,000 km away> to the west (around 6200 miles)…However this is by no means the end of the puzzling parallels. The mana powerwas symbolized by a sign that perhaps was supposed to concentrate is, and whichwas carved out on the backs of some statues. Strangely enough, it bears astriking similarity to the Egyptian magic “ankh” cross, which was supposed toperform the same function.76 Nor is the presence of the strange “ankh-like” symbol the only connection to thedistant cultures of the Middle East.The idea of “bird-men” figured prominently into the cultus of Easter Island andits traditions.77 This chimerical concept even appears as a heiroglyph in theRongo Rongo script itself.78 This bird- man symbol was perhaps the hieroglyphfor the islanders’ chief god, Make Make, who lived in the sky and who had such acommand over the mysterious “mana” force that he was isolated, because his powerover the mana was dangerous.79 Make Make’s dangerous control or use of the manaforce was manifest in lightning, “exactly the same motif associated with themain Andean god, Viracocha,”80 and, for that matter, the similar association ofthe principle god of Greece — Zeus — with thunderbolts, and the Mesopotamiangods Ninurta and Nergal with the same thing.81Moreover, there are other strange connections of the “bird-men” gods to theMiddle East. One need only think of the depiction of the Egyptian god of scienceand wisdom, Thoth:image [images/00057.jpg] Similar chimerical bird-man depictions are also found in Mesopotamia:image [images/00058.jpg] Mesopotamian Bird-Man It would thus appear then that in addition to a world-wide grid phenomenon thatwe are also confronted with the global extent of more or less the same religiousand mythological images accompanying it.2. The Mystery of Mohenjo Daro Nowhere is this better in evidence than in the suggestive ruins of Mohenjo Daroin India. We have already encountered the local legends of Viracocha suddenlydestroying the civilization of Tiahuanaco by “deadly rays,” with “lightning.”Make Make, Easter Island’s chief “sky god” similarly wields lightning, and itsRongo Rongo script connects it directly to the Indus Valley Civilization.The ruins of Mohenjo Daro are gruesome testimony that such a deliberate act ofmass destruction by some sort of technologically advanced means may haveactually once happened, for at Mohenjo Daro one finds a city and citadeldesigned with modern plumbing, sewers, and an intricacy of planning andsophistication that boggle the imagination, as a glance at its street plan willdemonstrate:image [images/00059.jpg] Street Plan of Mohenjo Daro in the Indus Valley image [images/00060.jpg] The Ruins of the Central Citadel of Mohenjo Daro However, the most peculiar thing about the ruins of the city is the fact that,lying strewn about its molten, vitrified ruins are several human skeletonslaying in the streets, some even holding hands, as if caught in some suddencatastrophe while going about their daily business: image [images/00061.jpg] The Skeletons of Mohenjo Daro Archaeologists investigating the area discovered a layer of radioactive ash nearthe region in Rajastan, India, covering an area of three square miles. So highwere the levels of radiation that the Indian government cordoned the regionoff.82 Digging further they discovered evidence of an atomic blast that occurredbetween 8,000 and 12,000 years ago.83 One of the skeletons of Mohenjo Daro wasdiscovered to have a level of radioactivity some “50 times greater than itshould have been due to natural radiation.”84Vicacocha’s “deadly rays,” indeed!Surveying this gruesome scene, one is reminded of the chilling words in theIndian epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana, depicting an ancient “war of thegods”:> Gurkha, flying in a swift and powerful vimana,Hurled a single projectile, Charged with all the power of the universe, An incandescent column of smoke and flame, As bright as ten thousand suns, Rose with all its splendour. > It was an unknown weapon,An iron thunderbolt, A gigantic messenger of death, Which reduced to ashes The entire race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. > The corpses were so burnedAs to be unrecognizable. Hair and nails fell out; Pottery broke without apparent cause, And the birds turned white…85 > (It was a weapon) so powerfulThat it could destroy the earth in an instant — A great soaring sound in smoke and flames — And on it sits death…86 > Dense arrows of flame,Like a great shower, Issued forth upon creation, Encompassing the enemy…. A thick gloom swiftly settled upon the Pandava hosts. All the points of the compass were lost in darkness. Fierce winds began to blow. Clouds roared upward Showering dust and gravel … The earth shook, Scorched by the terrible violent heat of this weapon. … From all points of the compass The arrows of flame rained continuously and fiercely.87 In my book The Giza Death Star I noted that these texts “are more thansuggestive of the effects and results of the use of nuclear weapons,” includingthe loss of hair and teeth88 and the reduction of glass and pottery to a fragilebrittleness due to exposure to high neutron and gamma radiation.But I also suggested that a closer examination of certain details of these textshinted at some other kind of weapon, one that could indeed “hurl lightning” in aconcentrated bolt of plasma, rather like squeezing the blast effects of ahydrogen bomb through a pipe, the “most significant” of those “suggestivephrases” being those which clearly stated that one was dealing “not with manynuclear bombs,” but with “one single weapon.”89 Additionally, other phrasessuggested something other than nuclear or thermonuclear weapons: > 1) “all the power of the universe” suggested a weapon somehow reliant upon the> energy of space-time itself; > 2) “the earth shook” suggests — if one take the phrase in the sense that> “earth” means the entire planet, and not simply “land” — suggests that the> entire planet’s energy was utilized or affected; > 3) “arrows of flame” that radiate “from all points of the compass” suggest,> again, a radiant energy converging on a target by means of electromagnetic> interferometry.90 I concluded that the Hindu epics, in addition to plausible descriptions ofnuclear weaponry in the conventional sense, were also describing a weapon basedupon the ability to manipulate the physical medium itself.91We now have an odd constellation of facts indicating a relationship betweenwhatever high civilization was behind the ruins of Puma Punkhu, Easter Island,and the Indus valley, among which are mythological parallels between Viracochaand the gods of the rest of the world, the similarity of construction methodsbetween Easter Island and Tiahuanaci and Puma Punkhu on the one hand, and theRongo Rongo script connecting it to the Indus Valley on the other.To this high strangeness we may now add yet a further piece of evidence thatsuggests a common civilization of in high antiquity, dispersed, for whateverreason, across the globe, and that is liguistics. Witkowski points out that hiscountryman, Professor Benon Szalek, made a comparison of the common word rootsof Basque, Hungarian, and…Japanese! From this he concluded that “these peoplesmust have been subjected to the influence of some single state organism — orthat they were once part of it.”92 Or perhaps we are in the presence of theinfluence of a hidden elite or elites with a common cultural origin?Howsoever one answers that question, Prof. Szalek’s linguistic investigationsrevealed something else, namely, that whatever connections as once existedbetween these groups was broken ca. 7000 BC.93 In other words, if there was tobe any “Tower of Babel Moment” in human history, it most likely occurred priorto 7000 BC.By now one will have noticed a peculiar thing: all the dates with which we havebeen concerned point to something pre-existing the ancient high civilizations ofSumer, Egypt, and the Indus Valley, and over and over again there is thefixation upon the date of 10,500 BC, within which the atomic layer of ash inIndia fits. Even the linguistic evidence suggests that “something catastrophic”happened to put an end to whatever civilization as may have existed in this timeframe. But there can be no doubt that something existed, and that it wassomething of great technological sophistication, for the ruins of Puma Punkhuclearly suggest it.3. The Mysterious Connections Deepen: Nan Madol, Mohenjo Daro, and Easter Island Nan Madol, which might justifiably be called the ancient Venice of the Pacific,and whose name means “in the middle of the way” in the ancient Dravidictongue,94 lies just slightly off-center of that “axis of the world” stretchingfrom Mohenjo Daro to Easter Island. A veritable pile of ancient stone ruins andcanals spread across islands in the southeastern Pacific, Nan Madol is anotherone of those places where the closer one looks, the more the mysteries multiply.Dotted with stepped pyramids about 30 feet high and various stone platforms, oneof the most curious features of Nan Madol is that basalt roads emanate from manyof these pyramids and lead “straight into the ocean!” As if that were notenough, one of these roads emerges from its submerged journey one thousand milesaway at the island of Rarotonga,95 a fact that strongly indicates that the areawas once above water.Like other spots on the Grid, Nan Madol and the wider Polynesian culture alsohas its traditions associated with certain sites, and in this case, twotraditions interest us. Like Easter Island, where the giant Maoi head statueswere said to have moved by themselves by some mysterious force called “mana,”the stone blocks of the pyramids at Nan Madol, weighting several tons, were saidto have been “moved and raised by magic.”96The second tradition, however, brings into stark relief yet another mysteryassociated with the Grid. Viracocha, the “sun-god” whom we previouslyencountered, was also the great “civilizer” god of the Incas, and was said to bewhite-skinned, bearded, and blue-eyed. As we shall discover in the next twochapters, the same claim is made for the civilizing god of the Mayans andAztecs, Kukulcan and Quetzlcoatl.The Polynesians, as many other Asian peoples, have similar traditions. After thefirst European missionaries arrived in the islands, they discovered that thePolynesians referred to themselves as “aomata,” a term that simply meant“humans.” But the Europeans were called “te-i-matang,” which meant “men from theland of the gods.”97 Other Polynesians referred to the white missionaries as“‘gold-haired children of Tangaroa,’ the god who according to their traditionscame millennia before as a teacher and civilizer.”98 The idea is repeated in theJapanese legend of the ancient Yamato,99 the white people who supposedly came toJapan, teaching civilization, in the legends of the Hopi tribe in North America,and even in the Hindu epic, the Ramayana.But if this tradition is “so strong and important, and so common, then we cannotassume that it wasn’t somehow anchored in reality.”100 However, if it isanchored in some “reality” lost in the mists of pre-history, what sort ofreality is it? Are we dealing with a vast dispersion, or the activity of anelite? Or both? The problem is compounded by recent genetic studies, which placethe origins of mankind in Africa, and from the black races some 150,000 to200,000 years ago. While this is not the place to explore possible resolutionsof this dilemma, it is worth suggesting that perhaps the dispersion of thiswhite group of peoples was done with a purpose, one suggested by the traditionsthemselves, for in each case they say that there was a purpose involved, anagenda, namely, to bring “civilization” to the rest of humanity. We might belooking at the purposeful dispersion of an elite, not a migration. In eithercase, given the extent of the traditions of such contacts across the globe, andthe equally suggestive linguistic evidence mentioned earlier, we are looking ata global activity and dispersion of this group of people.101In the middle of this historical conundrum sits Nan Madol, an ancient citycovering an area of almost eleven square miles, the center of which is a complexof artificially made islands occupying about one square mile. These islands areconnected by tunnels.102 The site has also almost defied all attempts at asystematic exploration. The first explorer to do so — Kubary in the nineteenthcentury — committed suicide after a ship bearing artifacts recovered by him atNan Madol sank on the way to Europe, and all his records and notes perished in ahouse fire. To this could be added dozens more who, visiting the site, perished,or were simply never seen again.103Kubary was succeeded by the German Paul Hambruch in the early twentieth century,whose extensive survey of the site was popularized by Herbert Rittlinger in abook published in Germany in 1939.104 Rittlinger also mentioned a story thatplatinum metal tablets, covered with an unknown form of writing, were recoveredthere. If this story is true, then it might be yet another possible connectionto those lost Sumerian “Tablets of Destiny,” and yet another possible connectionto the activity of someone trying to preserve knowledge.4. The Lost Civilization and the Flood: Polynesia, Egypt, and the Hopi As has been noted, one of the curious features of Nan Madol is the many roadsthat emanate from its pyramids, and then disappear into the ocean, and we havealready noted the Easter Island tradition of the Flood, the disappearance of aland to the west, and its faint suggestion that this was linked, somehow, to adeliberate action. Interestingly enough, Polynesian legends confirm this view,and even Egypt has a legend of “a great land in the east, among the waters of‘Uaj-ur’ (as they named the eastern seas) that has been claimed by the sea.”105Most interesting of these “lost land” legends, however, are those of the Hopi inNorth America, who maintain that they were evacuated to South America, whencethey made their way to North America.1065. The Land Bridge Collapses The Hopi legends raise a number of questions about the standard “land bridge”model of Amerindian migrations to the Americas, across a land bridge on theBering Straits between Siberia and Alaska, and thence gradually expandingsouthward from North America to South America. This theory was first formulatedin 1938 by Dr. Alexd Hrdlicka of the Museum of Natural History in New York.107But almost as soon as it was formulated the theory began to show cracks. Thefirst and most obvious was apparent even when Hrdlicka formulated the theory,for the anthropological diversity among Amerindians was far greater than histheory would allow.108 The most serious problem imposed by the theory, however,is that it carried with it the implicit assumption that the most advancedcultural traces should be found in North America, and as the migration spreadfurther south, less developed cultures should have emerged. But as we have seen,the most advanced culture in evidence — that at Puma Punkhu and Tiahuanaco — arefar in advance of anything further north.109 The chronological progression ofthe facts is not that implied by the theory.The discovery of human remains in 1963 in South America dating to 50,000 yearsago, along with tools, was such an obvious contradiction to the theory that itis all but ignored by anthropology in North America.110 Worse yet, remains ofblack, white, and mixed human skulls in Meso- and North America have added anelement of racial diversity on the American continents that the standard landbridge theory is unable to sustain.111 Even worse still, excavations in southernChile of a human settlement — the oldest on either of the American continents —was found to be approximately 33,000 years old.112 In other words, it was SouthAmerica, and not North America, that “became the scene of the most interesting,even breathtaking achievements — the continent that supposedly was peopled atthe very last.”113Worse yet, at Tafi del Valle, northwest of Buenos Aires in Argentina, there is alittle-known megalithic site, that deserves attention. “the Argentine sitewouldn’t be anything unusual either, if not for the fact that it looked as ifall the characteristic elements from Neolithic Europe were transferred there, asif by some magic force.”114 These included trilithions, aligned to the cardinalcompass points, stone circles, and phalluses.But the most fatal blow to the land bridge theory comes from mitochondrial DNA,the DNA that all humans inherit from their mother. When this DNA is sampled, theoldest human remains in the Americas shows that they belong to a distinctivelyPacific group called haplogroup B, common to the Pacific and southern NorthAmerica, but not to Siberia or Alaska.115 Worse still, blood-typing of SouthAmerican mummies revealed a preponderance of Blood type A Rh negative, a featurecommon to Europeans predominantly.6. Summary We have journeyed far from the Paradoxes of Puma Punkhu, but the paradoxes thereof advanced machining, and the genetic and cultural diversity of Amerindianpeoples point to a very different picture than that of the standard land bridgetheory. The almost unanimous traditions from Polynesia to the legends of the“white- skinned,” bearded civilizing gods Virachoca and — as we shall see in thenext two chapters — Kukalcan and Quetzlcoatl, point to a population that is verydiverse, and to the possible activity of a group of people traveling throughoutthe globe with an agenda, for over and over those traditions insist that thesepeople came to teach “civilization,” to aid in its preservation and rebuildingafter a great catastrophe.That catastrophe was evident in that the traditions of a Flood abound in almostall these cultures, a tradition that in some cases implies that the catastrophewas in part brought about by the use of technology in conflicts. In some cases,the giant stone remains — as at Puma Punkhu — were clearly the products of anadvanced machining technology well in excess of anything possessed even today.In other cases, legends and traditions ascribed a mysterious “force” to theplacement of such gigantic stones, the force of “mana” on Easter Island.Can any of these layers be peeled back still farther, to make some sense of thehistory of mankind, and why such monumental structures were undertaken at somany places? The answer is, yes, but in order to understand that answer, we mustnow journey northward, to Meso-America, and scrutinize the legends andstructures of the Mayans and Aztecs.1 Igor Witkowski, Axis of the World: The Search for the Oldest American Culture(Kempton, Illinois: Adventures Unlimited Press, 2008), p. 203.2 The wall is located at Sacsayhuaan, near Cuzco.

Accordingly, we shall focus here upon three sites — Tikal, ChichenItza, and Teotihuacan — and one mythology, the Mayan?Popol Vuh.The beginning of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and Meso-America in thesixteenth century saw the burning of many priceless records and books of theindigenous cultures, the records of thePopol Vuh, or The Dawn of Life and theGlories of Gods and Kings, among them.> Backed by means of persuasion that included gunpowder, instruments of torture,> and the threat of eternal damnation, the invaders established a monopoly on> virtually all forms of visible public expression, whether in drama,> architecture, sculpture, painting or writing. In the highlands, when they> realized that textile designs carried complex messages, they even attempted to> ban the wearing of Mayan styles of clothing. Hundreds of hieroglyphic books> were burned by missionaries, but they were still in use as late as the end of> the seventeenth century in Yucatán and the beginning of the eighteenth in> highland Guatemala.2In the midst of this destruction, the Mayans acted to preserve their culture byadopting a rather clever strategy, using Christian saints to disguise referencesto the ancient gods and using Roman alphabetic characters “as a mask for ancienttexts.”3Humanity would know little, if anything, about the Mayan creation myths andlegends were it not for these efforts, for the Popol Vuh as we have it now wasthe effort to preserve in alphabetic writing those myths, an effort undertakenby the three noble houses of the Mayans: “the Cauecs, the Greathouses, and theLord Quichés.”4 The book itself, as extant today, is as much a mystery as itsauthors, and it is best to cite its English translator, Dennis Tedlock, atlength here:> At the beginning of their book, the authors delicately describe the difficult> circumstances under which they work. When they tell us that they are writing> “amid the preaching of God, in Christendom now,” we can catch a plaintive tone> only by noticing that they make this statement immediately after asserting> that their own gods “accounted for everything — and did it, too — as> enlightened beings, in enlightened words.” What the authors propose to write> down is what Quichés call the Ojer Tzij, the “Ancient Word” or “Prior Word,”> which has precedence over “the preaching of God.” They have chosen to do so> because “there is no longer” a Popol Vuh, which makes it sound as though they> intend to re-create the original book solely on the basis of their memory of> what they have seen in its pages or heard in the long performance. But when we> remember their complaint about being “in Christendom,” there remains the> possibility that they still have the original book but are protecting it from> possible destruction by missionaries. Indeed, their next words make us wonder> whether the book might still exist, but they no sooner raise our hopes on this> front than they remove the book’s reader from our grasp: “There is the> original book and ancient writing, but the one who reads and assesses it has a> hidden identity.” ...If they are protecting anyone with their enigmatic> statements about an inaccessible book or an anonymous reader, it could well be> themselves.5Fascinating as the history of the Popol Vuh and Mayan culture are,> however, our attention must remain fixed upon its contents and its> implications for our study of the Grid. But before we examine its contents,> one last point must be mentioned, for one of the things that clearly emerges> from Mayan culture is that its frequent references to a place called “Tulan”> or “Tula” mean precisely the ancient ruins of Teotihuacan, outside of Mexico> City.6 We shall have much to say about this site later in this chapter.A. The Popol Vuh1. The Primordial Triad and Differentiation:The Topological Metaphor, Mayan Style Like the Hindu cosmology laid out in stone reliefs at Angkor Wat, The Popol Vuhbegins in an abyss of mystery, an abyss laid out in eloquent and elegantlysimple words and imagery whose power is made even more manifest by their poeticsimplicity:This is the account, here it is:> Now it still ripples, now it still murmurs, ripples, it still sighs, still> hums, and it is empty under the sky.> Here follow the first words, the first eloquence.> There is not yet one person, one animal, bird, fish, crab, tree, rock, hollow,> canyon, meadow, forest. Only the sky alone is there; the face of the earth is> not clear. Only the sea along is pooled under all the sky; there is nothing> whatever gathered together. It is at rest; not a single thing stirs. It is> held back, kept at rest under the sky.> Whatever there is that might be is simply not there: only murmurs, ripples, in> the dark, in the night. Only the Maker, Modeler alone, Sovereign Plumed> Serpent, the Bearers, Begetters are in the water, a glittering light. They are> there, they are enclosed in quetzal feathers, in blue- green.> Thus the name, “Plumed Serpent.” They are great knowers, great thinkers in> their very being.> And of course there is the sky, and there is also the Heart of Sky. This is> the name of the god, as it is spoken.> And then came his word, he came here to the Sovereign Plumed Serpent, here in> the blackness, in the early dawn.... ThunderboltHurricane comes first, the> second is Newborn Thunderbolt, and the third is Sudden Thunderbolt.So there were three of them...7By now, this powerful, evocative imagery should recall the image of Vishnu atAngkor Wat, superintending the cosmic tug-of-war of the great naga serpent inthe Milky Ocean.Yet, this appears half a world away, in an entirely different culture!Note too, that the topological metaphor of a primordial trinity is preserved.Everything begins as an emptiness “under the sky” and there is not yet anydifferentiation within it: “there is not yet one person, one animal” and so on.There is only an empty sky, and pooled water at rest beneath it. The only thingexisting is Sovereign Plumed Serpent and a mysterious reference to “Bearers” and“Begetters in the water” who are described as “great knowers, great thinkers intheir very being,” who are later found, just like Vishnu, to be manifestationsof Sovereign Plumed Serpent.The Popol Vuh is telling us, in other words, the same thing we saw at AngkorWat: there is a primordial “nothing”, Sovereign Plumed Serpent, and then thereis a primordial “trinity,” of endless indistinct “sky” and below it a “sea”, andthe implied common surface between the two. Nothing else whatsoever, at thisjuncture, exists, except a faint “murmuring” and “rippling” in the night,implying somehow that sound, frequency, vibration give rise to all the fecunddistinctions and variety to follow.Indeed, at the very beginning, the Popol Vuh informs us that “This is thebeginning of the Ancient Word, here in this place called Quiché. Here we shallinscribe, we shall implant the Ancient Word, the potential and source foreverything done...in the nation of the Quiché people.”8 Note that the AncientWord is something to be implanted, again recalling the imagery of Vishnuejaculating into the primordial sea, which was but himself under anothermanifestation. Note too the very suggestive notion that this Word, this sound orvibration as it were, is “the potential and source for everything done,” thatis, that all the diversity that arises, arises from this pure and infinitepotential.Consequently, it would appear that the Popol Vuh, in its very opening pages, issuggesting the very same topological metaphor of the physical medium that weencountered in chapter three, in connection with Vishnu’s “trifurcation” anddifferentiation of himself as a primordial Nothing, and that we also discoveredoperative in some passages in the Hermetica, which were of Egyptian provenance,only here the metaphor of that “differentiated Nothing” is even more clearlysuggested by the notion of an endless sky and endless sea, in neither of whichnothing else exists; there is only the sky, the sea, and the surface touching,differentiating, or bracketing, both; again we have three entities of yetanother primordial triad.Thus, our chart from chapter three now looks like this:image [images/00062.jpg] So now, we may add to what we stated about this topological metaphor of themedium in chapter three, for now we encounter yet more imagery — sky, sea, andthe implied surface between the two — all saying the same thing: that we aredealing with a differentiated Nothing, whose first differentiation must alwaysbe triadic or trinitarian in nature:> 1) the “bracketed” region of Nothing, or image [images/00026.jpg], Hermes’> “Kosmos”, the Padama Purana’s Shiva, and now, the Popol Vuh’s “sky”; > 2) the rest of the Nothing, or image [images/00027.jpg], Hermes’ “God,” the> Padama Purana’s Vishnu, and now, the Popol Vuh’s “sea”; and, > 3) the “surface” Nothing that the two regions share, or image> [images/00028.jpg], Hermes’ “Space,” the Padama Purana’s Brahma, and now,> thePopol Vuh’s implied common surface between “sea” and “sky”. However, the Popol Vuh goes on to make an even more interesting and suggestiveset of statements that would seem to associate the creation of mankind itselfwith this process of emerging differentiation from some sort of materia prima or“primordial nothing.”2. The Engineering of Man Very quickly after this account of the initial “trifurcation” of creation, thePopol Vuh moves to the creation of mankind himself, after the creation of landand animals,9 and it does so once again, in equally evocative, elegant, andpowerful poetic imagery:> Again there comes an experiment with the human work, the human design, by the> Maker, Modeler, Bearer, Begetter:“It must simply be tried again. The time for the planting and dawning isnearing. For this we must made a provider and nurturer. How else can we beinvoked and remembered on the face of the earth? We have already made our firsttry at our work and design, but it turned out that they didn’t keep our days,nor did they glorify us. “So now let’s try to make a giver of praise, giver of respect, provider,nurturer,” they said. “So then comes the building and working with earth and mud. They made a body,but it didn’t look good to them. It was just separating, just crumbling, justloosening, just softening, just disintegrating, and just dissolving. Its headwouldn’t turn, either. Its face was just lopsided, its face was just twisted. Itcouldn’t lookaround. It talked at first, but senselessly. It was quicklydissolving in the water. “It won’t last,” the mason and sculptor said then. “It seems to be dwindlingaway, so let it just dwindle. It can’t walk and it can’t multiply, so let it bemerely a thought,” they said. So then they dismantled, again they brought down their work and design.10 Note that the rough order of creation in the Mayan mythology is that of thebiblical Genesis: land forms, then animals of various types, and then finallythis first “protohuman.”But what is very different about the Mayan version is the clear indication thatmankind is the result of an experiment, one that was for the express purpose ofcreating intelligent servants to “the gods.” In other words, the Mayans arereproducing, centuries later, and half a world and an ocean away, and what wasfirst suggested in the texts of Mesopotamia: mankind was an engineered creation,created for the express purpose of servitude to the gods. He wasproperty.11Life, on this view, was less a gift, than a debt to be paid inendless service.The Popol Vuh gives a further hint of this concept of mankind as an experiment,and with it, the Flood is introduced:This was the peopling of the face of the earth:> They came into being, they multiplied, they had daughters, they had sons,> these manikins, woodcarvings. But there was nothing in their hearts and> nothing in their minds, no memory of their mason and builder. They just went> and walked wherever they wanted. Now they did not remember the Heart of Sky.> And so they fell, just an experiment and just a cutout for humankind. They> were talking at first but their faces were dry. They were not yet developed in> the legs and arms. They had no blood, no lymph. Their complexions were dry,> their faces were crusty. They flailed their legs and arms, their bodies were> deformed.> And so they accomplished nothing before the Maker, Modeler who gave them> birth, gave them heart. They became the first numerous people here on the face> of the earth.Again there comes a humiliation, destruction, and demolition. The manikins,woodcarvings were killed when the Heart of Sky devised a flood for them. A greatflood was made; it came down on the heads of the manikins, woodcarvings.12A little further on, there is even more commentary: > Such was the scattering of the human work, the human design. The people were> ground down, overthrown. The mouths and faces of all of them were destroyed> and crushed. And it used to be said that the monkeys in the forests today are> a sign of this. They were left as a sign because wood alone was used for their> flesh by the builder and sculptor.So this is why monkeys look like people: they are a sign of a previous humanwork, human design — mere manikins, mere woodcarvings.13 In other words, there is no notion or conception of anything resemblingevolutionary theory; rather, monkeys are the signs of another failed attempt at“the human work and design.”3. The Primordial “Masculine Homosexual Androgyny” of Man and the Tower of BabelMoment The strangest aspect of the Mayan account of the creation of mankind is itssuggestion of a kind of “primordial masculine homosexual androgyny” for thecreature, and its coupling of the subsequent division of the sexes with a lossof human knowledge and intellectual power in a kind of Tower of Babel moment.This part of the Popol Vuh begins by noting that at the beginning of the“conception of humans” there was a search for “the ingredients of the humanbody” by the “Bearer, Begetter, the Makers,Modelers named Sovereign PlumedSerpent.”14 It is interesting to note that one is dealing with Quetzlcoatlagain, but note that this deity is spoken of both in singular and plural terms,rather like a “council of the gods.” This fashioning of mankind is called themaking or modeling “of our first mother-father,”15 and with that, we haveencountered our first Mayan androgynous image for God Himself.The Popul Vuh goes on to explain this androgyny in explicitly masculine terms:“They were good people, handsome, with looks of the male kind.”16 Then followsone of the most bizarre passages in the entire book:> And then they saw everything under the sky perfectly. After that, they thanked> the Maker, Modeler:> “ Truly now,> double thanks, triple thanks> that we’ve been formed, we’ve been given> our mouths, our faces,> we speak, we listen,> we wonder, we move,> our knowledge is good, we’ve understood> what is far and near,> and we’ve seen what is great and small> under the sky or on earth.> Thanks to you we’ve been formed,> we’ve come to be made and modeled,> our grandmother, our grandfather.”they said when they gave thanks for having been made and modeled. Theyunderstood everything perfectly, they sighted the four sides, the four cornersin the sky, on the earth, and this didn’t sound good to the builder andsculptor: “What our works and designs have said is no good: “‘We have understood everything, great and small,’ they say.” And so theBearer, Begetter took back their knowledge.“What should we do with them now? Their vision should at least reach nearby,they should at least see a small part of the face of the earth, but what they’resaying isn’t good. Aren’t they merely ‘works’ and ‘designs’ in their very names?Yet they’ll become as great as gods, unless they procreate, proliferate at thesowing, the dawning, unless they increase.”“Let it be this way: now we’ll take them apart just a little, that’s what weneed. What we’ve found out isn’t good. Their deeds would become equal to ours,just because their knowledge reaches so far. They see everything,” so said> the Heart of Sky, Hurricane,> Newborn Thunderbolt, Sudden Thunderbolt, Sovereign Plumed Serpent,> Bearer, Begetter, Xiyacoc, Xmucane, Maker, Modeleras they are called. And when they changed the nature of their works, theirdesigns, it was enough that the eyes be marred by the Heart of Sky.... And such was the loss of the means of understanding, along with the means ofknowing everything, by the four humans. The root was implanted....And then their wives and women came into being.17This passage requires careful scrutiny and unpacking in order for the fullweight of its implications to sink in.> 1) Note first of all that, just as in the Biblical story of the Tower of> Babel,18 there is no notion of morality in play, for the activities of mankind> are not perceived so much as immoral but rather as an implicit threat to the> power of the gods “just because their knowledge reaches so far.” One is> reminded of the biblical reason given for the confounding of languages at the> Tower of Babel, for if the Tower was completed, mankind would be able “to do> whatever it imagined to do;” > 2) This human knowledge, in so far as the Popol Vuh is concerned, relates> somehow to mankind’s cosmological knowledge, to his understanding of the> physics of the cosmos and being able to sight “the four corners in the sky, on> the earth.” Given thetopological metaphor we have examinedpreviously, the> metaphor here seems to be suggesting thatmankind’s knowledge was of the very> way the physical medium itself was constituted and of how it operated. This> too is mirrored in the biblical Tower of Babel story, where the purpose of the> Tower is to “reach unto heaven;”19 again implying that somehow human knowledge> was of a deep physics; > 3) In the Popol Vuh, all this knowledge and deep insight is coupled somehow to> what can only be described as mankind’s primordial “masculine> homosexual-androgyny,” a fact that seems also to be reproduced in the way that> this creature refers also to the Sovereign Plumed Serpent, or God, both as> grandmother and grandfather, as an androgyny; God, in other words, is viewed> in the same way and this, somehow, suggests that in mankind, in his primordial> masculine homosexual-androgynous constitution, had knowledge of some> characteristic of the physical medium that he would not otherwise have had;> this leads to the next point: > 4) The Popol Vuh makes it very clear that this primordial “masculine> homosexual-androgyny” had to be divided “just a little” in order to eradicate> the threat posed by the knowledge he possessed in that original state; the> division of the sexes is accomplished, and at this point “their wives and> women came into being,” causing procreation and the corresponding loss of> human knowledge. This seems to imply that in mankind’s primordial state,> immortality was the natural consequence, and therefore with it, a> commensurately wide knowledge. It is worth noting that a vaguely similar idea> is even suggested in the biblical account of the Tower of Babel moment, where> it says “And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one.” Again, the solution is> to divide humanity; in the biblical instance, it is division through> multiplication of languages; in the Mayan instance, it is division by the> division of the sexes; > 5) And lest it be thought that this primordial view of mankind as a kind of> “masculine homosexual-androgyny” is far removed from the world of the Old> Testament half a world andcenturies away, a closer look at Gen 1:27 is in> order. In the standard English translation the verse reads “So God created man> in his own image, in the image of God created he him; make and female created> he them.” But in the Septuagint Greek of the verse, the word “them” is> actually “them,” but with one difference, the word “them” here is also> masculine in gender, but lacks a second repetition of the word “them” in the> feminine gender. Thus, while the verse can certainly be interpreted in the> traditional manner with the masculine “them” as a pars pro toto usage> designating a male and female “them,” it is also worth nothing that it is> capable of bearing a Mayan-like interpretation as well, as indicating a kind> of “primordial masculine homosexual-androgyny,” with the subsequent division> of the sexes in Genesis chapter two representing a kind of “second creation;”> this little-known possibility would in fact lead to many interesting> speculations in the early centuries of Christianity, but this is not the place> to delve into them.20 As we turn from this suggestive passage and all the previous allusions to thetopological metaphor in the Popol Vuh to a consideration of the actualstructures of Meso-America themselves, bear in mind that deep knowledge and theimplied deep physics, for now it begins to come home to roost; and with it, wealso see the beginning glimmers of the reasons for the practice in thesesocieties of human sacrifice.B. The Structures1. Tikal and Chichen Itza We will begin this technical exposition at Tikal in CentralAmerica. The firstthing to be noted about Tikal is that it lies exactly120 degrees longitude westof Giza, in other words, exactly one third the distance around the world fromGiza. Here there are five large Mayan pyramids, which are unusual in that theyare all taller than they are wide. In this, the Mayan Pyramids — like theirmythology —suggests connections to India, where similar temples are in evidenceat Madurai:image [images/00063.jpg] The Madurai Temples in Southern India There are five such elongated pyramids at Tikal, and like the temples of Maduariin India, they all have a temple-like structure at the top of the edifice:image [images/00064.jpg] Layout of Tikal21 Munck gives the heights of these temples as follows:> 1) Temple I: 154.8 feet; > 2) Temple II: 142.7 feet; > 3) Temple III: 177.8 feet; > 4) Temple IV: 228.6 feet; > 5) Temple V: 188 feet.22 Additionally, each of these Temples incorporates some harmonic of the number656, usually at the level of the platform on which the temple atop the structurerests.23Three of the temples — II, III, and IV — face east, temple V faces north, andtemple I faces west, and again, the center of the compound is 120 degrees westof the Giza prime meridian. Moreover, each of these temples, with the exceptionof temple II, all have ten steps or terraces, with the temple atop the tenth.Temple II has three major terraces. But most importantly, all these temples areall, per Munck’s classification, corrupted pyramids, that is, they are steppedpyramids with corners and faces, and all of them are higher than the width oftheir base. For the moment, we will forego the counting of corners and faces onthese monuments to comment on the second fact concerning these pyramids: thatthey are taller than their base.It is this fact that leads us into the deep physics that these structures werepossibly designed to access, for all pyramids have one property in common: theyall have some relationship of base-to-height proportional to π divided by two,that is, the basic formula of all pyramids is:image [images/00065.jpg]where h = height, b = base.This point recalls remarks concerning secret Soviet research into pyramids thatI wrote years ago in The Giza Death Star Deployed, which are cited at lengthhere in order to illuminate the relationship of thethree basic types of pyramidsand the deeper underlying physics possibilities that they embody:> A much more substantial research into “pyramid power” was undertaken in the> former Soviet Union where several large pyramids were built and their> properties investigated at great expense. The research is being continued by> Dr. Volodymyr Krasnoholovets of the Institute of Physics of the Ukrainian> National Academy of Sciences in Kiev. Notably, Krasnoholovets has been led by> his research to posit a “sub-quantum mechanics” with some peculiar properties> that recall our own speculations about the tetrahedral properties of the> mediumNoting that the electromagnetic, the weak, and the strong forces of currentquantum mechanics intersect at a scale of 10-28 cm, Krasnoholovets then takesthis measure as the size of the building blocks of space itself. Space thus hasa cellular structure... where particles appear as deformations of thisstructure.24 These elementary perturbations of space itself, these “fundamental particles”,Krasnoholovets very suggestively calls “inertons.” Without going into thecomplicated argument of his paper, it is worth noting that Krasnoholovets makesmention of the “ex nihilo” characteristics:“Of special is the approach proposed by Bounias (1990, 2000) and Bounias andBonaly (1994, 1996, 1997). Basing on topology and set theory, they havedemonstrated that the necessity of the existence of the empty set leads totopological spaces resulting in a “physical universe.” Namely, they haveinvestigated the links between physical existence, observability, andinformation. The introduction of the empty hyperset has allowed a preliminaryconstruction of a formal structure that correlates with the degenerate cell ofspace supporting conditions for the existence of a universe. Besides, amongother results we can point to their very promising hypothesis on a non-metrictopologcial distance as the symmetric difference between sets: this could be agood alternative to the conventional metric distance which so far is stilltreated as themajor characteristic in all concepts employed in gravitationalphysics, cosmology, and partly in quantum mechanics.”25 I then observed the following:> Behind the obtuse technical language lies a series of very unique insights:> 1. The current mathematical “languages” used to describe the interactions of> sub-atomic particles with space is inadequate; > 2. It is inadequate because it is based on a form of mathematical language> where measurements of distance, or more simply, vectors are the primary thing> in view; > 3. A more adequate way to account for the peculiarities of quantum and> sub-quantum mechanics is via set theory, that is, a mathematical language that> compares the properties of systems or sets wherein properties of distance and> vectors are only sub- sets of a greater set of properties. Simply put,> Krasnoholovets is saying that the fundamental language of physics must change> from a linear mathematical language — points, lines, planes, vectors and so on> — to a non-linear language inclusive of such things but not limited to them.> Hence his emphasis on information. Sets of physical properties, on this view,> are a much fuller description of the “information in the field.” Note now that Krasnoholovets is thinking in the same terms as our previouslydiscussed topological metaphor, which also employed differentiations on theempty hyper-set image [images/00066.jpg] to model the emergence of observableentities from a primordial Nothing.> Thus...Krasnoholovets introduces the idea that the fundamental relationship> between a particle and space itself is harmonic in nature, since a particle,> by moving, exhibits inertia and sets up an oscillation in space itself. Or as> he puts it, “It is the space substrate, which induces the harmonic potential> responding to the disturbance of the space by the moving particle”26 itself> that is in primary view.Again, we must pause to note how well our topological metaphor corresponds tothis idea of harmonic relationships between the various cells in space-time, forit will be recalled that by differentiating that primordial nothing image[images/00066.jpg]we ended with two regions distinguished by a common surface:image [images/00027.jpg], image [images/00026.jpg], and image[images/00067.jpg]. Note that each expression formally distinguishes image[images/00024.jpg]but that the signature of image [images/00024.jpg] remains ineach expression: each of the three entities is, in other words, analogically orharmonically related to the other two; each is an oscillator of the others.> But what has all this to do with pyramids? Krasnoholovets’ answer is rather> breathtaking:> “Let A be a point on the Earth’s surface from which an inerton wave is> radiated. If the inerton wave travels around the globe along the West-East> line, its front will pass a distance L1=2πrearth per circle. The second flow> spread along the terrestrial diamater; such inerton waves radiated from A will> come back passing distance L2=4πrearth. The ratio is:> L1/L2 = π/2.> If in point A we locate a material object with linear sizes (along the> West-East line and perpendicular to the Earth’s surface_ such that it> satisfies (the above) relation, we will receive a resonator of the Earth’s> inerton waves.27I then noted that the Great Pyramid, “because it is constructed in preciselysuch a fashion and geometric disposition with respect to the earth, is a coupledharmonic oscillator of the very inertial properties of the planetary spaceitself.”28But the same can now be said of all pyramidal structures, for allof them, without exception, bear some relationship to that fundamental ratio ofπ/2, according to that equation noted previously:image [images/00065.jpg]where h = height, b = base. As I observed in The Giza Death Star Destroyed every pyramid is in relationshipto this ratio, and there are thus only three types of pyramids that can result,depending on their relationship to that ratio; I reproduced the followingdiagram:image [images/00068.jpg] Relationships of Pyramid Types to the Ratio π/2 Note that the temples of Tikal(as those at Madurai in India), are of the sharppyramidal type, while all other pyramids — with the notable exception of theGreat Pyramid and the Cephren Pyramid at Giza — are of the obtuse type.But what would the functions of these different shapes be? Here is it best tocite what I wrote in The Giza Death Star Deployed once again:> Krasnoholovets speculates that “the sharp pyramid plays the role of a> radiator” and that it may also “function as an antennaabsorbing inerton> radiation from outer space.”29The obtuse pyramid “to the contrary... may> rather function as a radiator that emits amplified interton waves into the> Earth surface.”30 And thus, the most efficient shape to combine both functions> would be in the dimensions of the Great Pyramid itself, “the happy medium.”31To put it succinctly, on this view of pyramids as resonators of the fabric ofspace-time, of the physical medium itself, then Tikal is an antenna array.But it is that all-important method of Munck — the counting of faces and corners— that as we shall see in a later chapter, leads to the most astonishingconfirmation of this view, and in a way that most Grid researchers neverimagined. Before leaving Tikal, however, it is important to mention just a fewof the significant numerical coding that Munck discovered there that confirm theview of Krasnoholovets that these structures are resonators of the Earth. Inthis case, the width of the “temple” atop the first pyramid at Tikal is24.9015 feet, which is the equatorial circumference of the Earth in miles:24,901.5 miles.32 This, plus the fact that Tikal is exactly 120 degrees west ofthe Giza prime meridian — plus the counting of faces and corners that we shallexamine later — tends to confirm the view of Michell that we are, indeed, livinginside of, or in the midst of, a vast, ruined machine.2. Chichen Itza and Human Sacrifice We must now journey to Chichen Itza and Teotihuacan, to briefly view the massivepyramids of the other type: the obtuse pyramids of Meso-America. The mostprominent feature of Chichen Itza is the massive pyramid ofKukulcan/Quetzlcoatl, an obtuse pyramid:image [images/00069.jpg] Pyramid of Kukulkan, Photo Courtesy of Dr. Scott D. de Hart The four staircases of this pyramid contain exactly 365 steps, the number ofdays in a year. But here, as at Tikal, the numbers conceal yet anotherconnection to the Giza Prime Meridian.Each of the four staircases up the pyramid are, of course, 90 degrees apart. Ifone divides 365 by 90, one obtains 4.055, and this is the “tangent of thesurface distance of 7123.85 statute miles which separates the Kukulkan Pyramidfrom Giza’s Great Pyramid.”33 Like Tikal, the numbers point to a consciouslyconceived and deliberately constructed system anchored upon Giza. Again, we arelooking at a vast machine, and notably, the “sharp pyamids” of Tikal and theobtuse Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza — and those of Teotihuacan as we shallsee in a moment — are tied to the two grat Pyramids at Giza, which are in the“perfect” shape to be both antennae resonators and emitters.There is, however, a darkness hovering over Chichen Itza, one we have mentionedbefore, and it is time to begin to address it more directly: human sacrifice.The Popol Vuh makes it clear that both males and females34 were sacrificedwithin Mayan practice, and for the usual reasons, to guarantee fertility amongthe population, and so on.35One passage of the Popol Vuh records the gods’ twisted delight in the smell ofthe burnt offerings:“It has turned out well, your lordships, and this is her heart. It’s in thebowl.”> “Very well. So I’ll look,” said One Death, and when he lifted it up with his> fingers, its surface was soaked with gore, its surface glistened red with> blood.> “Good. Sir up the fire, put it over the fire,’ said One Death.> After that they dried it over the fire, and the Xibalbans savored the aroma.> They all ended up standing here, they leaned over it intently. They found the> smoke of the blood to be truly sweet!36A similar attitude to the aroma of sacrifice is recorded in the Book of Genesis:> And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of> every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And the LORD> smelled a sweet savor...37But why, at least in Meso-America, would the practice of sacrifice even arise onits famous Grid sites?There are only two clues. The first of these is that sacrifice is a kind ofpayment to the gods.38 This follows from the idea of the creation account in thePopol Vuh itself: life was not a gift of the gods to man, but was merely a meansto an end: mankind’s perpetual service to the gods; mankind was a slave,property, a kind of collateral to perpetual debt, a concept with which we shallhave much to say in the next chapter.The second clue is provided by the quotation cited above, and by the following:> And this is the sacrifice of little Huanhpu by Xibalanque. One by one his> legs, his arms were spread wide. His head came off, rolled far away outside.> His heart, dug out, was smothered in a leaf, and all the Xibalbans went crazy> at the site.39Here the Xibalbans, the “gods,” are “going crazy” at the site of the sacrifice,and this is consistent with the attitude cited earlier, that the aroma of thesacrifice was pleasing to them, an attitude we find echoed — over and over againin fact — in the Old Testament.Viewed objectively, it would appear that bloody sacrifices are understood toinduce some change in the state or attitude of conciousness in the “gods.” This,plus the fact that at least in Meso- America’s case these sacrifices are beingperformed at Grid sites, might be a profound clue as to why the practice arosein the first place.To summarize: the practice of sacrifice appears to be tied to two distinctconceptions, as least, in so far as the Popol Vuh is concerned:> 1) To the conception of humanity in perpetual slavery, servitude, and debt;> and, > 2) To the idea that bloody sacrifice somehow induces a change in the state or> attitude of consciousness in the “gods.” When we add to this list the observations concerning the shapes of pyramids andtheir relationship to π/2, we have a very odd constellation of things indeed,for clearly the pyramidal shape, the numbers encoded in them, and therelationship of Tikal, Chichen Itza and virtually every other site on the Gridto Giza, means that we are living inside a ruined machine of planetary extent.We have furthermore seen that, insofar as the deepest physics is concerned, thatmachine was intended somehow to manipulate the physical medium itself.So is there a relationship between that deep physics, consciousness, andsacrifice? And if so, what is it?To answer that question, we need more data, and we will find it, further north,at Teotihuacan, and with the Aztecs.1 Dennis Tedlock, trans.

Why this practiceshould have arisen at some locations and within some cultures on the Gridremains a mystery, although, as we saw in the previous chapter, there are clues.Perhaps no human culture has been so identified with the practice, however, thanthat of the Aztecs. It intrudes itself as a moral ugliness and incongruity intoa society and culture in which — as with the Mayans — it seems out of place, aninexplicably bloody ugliness. Hancock and Faiia capture this terrible anomaly asbest as anyone, in very evocative words: > Travelers in Central America who have attempted to explore its monuments and> its past have come away haunted by the intuition of a great and terrible> mystery.

The Aztecs and Human Sacrifice:1. The Original Teaching of Quetzlcoatl The Aztec’s principal god was the god Quetzlcoatl who, like the Mayan’sKukulcan, and the Incas’ Viracocha, was a white-skinned, blue-eyed, bearded“civilizer god” who taught the Aztecs the basics of civilization. Like theMayans’ Sovereign Plumed Serpent, Quetzlcoatl was a feathered serpent. Rulingthe Mexica in a past Golden Age when he taught the arts of civilization, he alsostipulated, clearly and unequivocally, that living things were never to beharmed and, more importantly, that humans were never to be sacrificed. The onlythings to be sacrificed were various plants, fruits, and flowers of a particularseason.3 If one were to place this conception within the cultural framework ofthe Old Testament, Quetzlcoatl would be the Old Testament’s Cain — who offeredGod only sacrifices of plants — to its Abel, who offered the “more acceptable”sacrifices of animals.We are looking, in other words, in all likelihood, at a common metaphor, asymbolic motif, that is not unique to one specific religion — in this case, thatof the ancient Hebrews — but at a much more widespread idea, for in both cases,the earliest type of sacrifice is hardly bloody, but is later replaced by onewhich is. Indeed, as far as the Aztecs were concerned, their civilization — likethe Egyptians’ views of their civilization an ocean away — was a legacy receivedwhole cloth from Quetzlcoatl.4As if to reinforce this idea of common motifs spread over the planet anddispersed among distinct cultures, one can also observe a number of peculiarparallels between Quetzlcoatlt and, of all people, the Egyptian god Osiris. LikeOsiris, Quetzlcoatl was buried in a sarcophagus, whence he was resurrected toascend into heaven to become a star.5But how, with such commonality, did the Aztecs derive the practice of humansacrifice? Laurette Sejourne, drawing on the vast legacy of Aztec culture leftbehind, concluded in 1956 that the whole apparatus and practice of humansacrifice was a badly understood metaphor, a metaphor of a ritual of initiationthat had been taken literally by the Aztecs. Thus, for the “cutting out of theheart,” a metaphor for the soul’s “cutting out” from the body at death,, the“flailing of the heart” was a metaphor for spiritual detachment from thephysical body and senses, and so on. All of these metaphors for spiritualprocesses were, argued Sejourne, massively misunderstood by the Aztecs, andbecame part of the ritual of sacrifice.If this be the case, then it was a metaphor massively misunderstood by theMayans and Incas as well. Moreover, Sejourne is not entirely correct, for theAztec’s own statements indicate that if there was misunderstanding involved,then it was not original to them, but rather, a misunderstanding deliberatelyinculcated as an old order was overturned, and a new one ushered in to replaceit. Once again, the chronological progression was from sacrifices of plants andflowers and grains, the original order of the civilizing god Quetzlcoatl, and alater order of bloody human sacrifices.Curiously, their practice of sacrifice also has something to do with the Flood,for just as we saw in the previous chapter, Noah made bloody sacrifice after theFlood. The Flood, in Aztec cosmology, is in turn connected to their doctrine ofthe Five Suns, or if one prefer, the Five World Ages. Each of these ages is a“sun” and is ended by various catastrophes, and each requires the re-establishment of life and of humanity.6The first sun ended with all life literally consuming itself. This was followedby the destruction of the sun itself.7 The second sun age ended in a destructionby wind, when all life and even the sun itself was destroyed by a massive wind.8The third sun age was ended in a rain of fire.9 The fourth sun age ended withthe Flood,10 ushering in this, the final and fifth sun age.At this juncture, according to the Aztec creation and history, the CodexChimalpopoca, the Sun refused to move for four days: > Then the gods say, “Why doesn’t he move?” Then they send the blade falcon, who> goes and tells the sun that it has come to question him. It tells him, “The> gods are saying, ‘Ask him why he doesn’t move.’” > Then the sun said, “Why? Because I’m asking for their blood their color,> their precious substance.” > … > Then all the gods get together: Titlacahuan, Nuitzilopochtli, and the> women Xochiquetzal, Yapalliicue, Nochpalliicue. And there in Teotihucan they> all died a scarificial death. So then the sun went into the sky.11 In other words, the celestial machinery was so broken it had stopped, and couldonly be restarted by the sacrifice of the gods themselves — notably atTeotihuacan. In so far as the Aztec’s cosmology was concerned, sacrifice wasintimately connected to the physics. But again, why?2. Curious Statements, The Human Payment, and Two Elitesa. Unusual Ritual Parallels As one reads more deeply into the Codex Chimalpopoca, the mystery only deepens.For example, shortly before the account of the fall of Tollan, the Aztecs’version of Tula, Thule, or the land across the sea from whence they came, thereis an account of the dedication of a temple of the King Ce Acatl in a ritual ofblood sacrifice that, to some, will sound very familiar:> Now, Ce Acatl’s uncles, who are of the four hundred Mixcoa, absolutely hated> his father, and they killed him. > And when they had killed him, they went and put him in the sand. > Then the king vulture says to him, “They’ve killed your father. It’s over> yonder that he lies, that they’ve buried him.” > So he went and dug him up and put him in his temple, Mixcoatepetl. > Now, his uncles, the ones who killed his father, are called Apanecatly,> Zolton, and Cuilton, and they say, “How will he dedicate his temple? If> there’s only a rabbit, if there’s only a snake, we would be angry. A jaguar,> an eagle, a world would be good.” And so they told him this. > Ce Acatl said — he told them — “Alright. It shall be.” > Then he called the jaguar, the eagle, and the wolf. He said to them,> “Come, uncles. They say I must use you to dedicate my temple. But you will not> die. Rather you will eat the ones I use to dedicate my temple — they’re those> uncles of mine.” And so it was without any real purpose that ropes were tied> around their necks. > … > Then his uncles are furious, and off they go, Apanecatl in the lead,> climbing quickly. > But Ca Acatly rose up and broke his head with a burnished pot, and he came> tumbling down. > Then he seizes Zolton and Cuilton. Then the animals blow (on the fire).> Then they sacrifice them. > … And after they’ve tortured them, they cut open their breasts.12 If one did not know better, one might think one was reading the rituals of thefirst three degrees of Freemasonry, for we find no less than these commonelements between them:> 1) a king, in the Masonic ritual, Hiram Abiff, king of Tyre, who is building> the Temple, and in the Aztec version Ce Acatl;> 2) his “three attendants,” in the Masonic ritual, Jubelo, Jubela, and> Jubelum, and in the Aztec version Apanecatl, Zolton, and Cuilton;> 3) a temple, which in both cases, is “dedicated” by human sacrifice, in the> Masonic ritual, by the murder of King Hiram by his three attendants, and in> the Aztec case, just the reverse, by the king’s murder of his three> attendants; and,> 4) torture, followed by the cutting open of the breast, which recalls the> Masonic ritual once again, where the point of a compass is pressed to the left> nipple of the candidate for initiation.The ritual of the Blue Lodge of Masonry is of unquestioned antiquity, but whatare its echoes doing here, in the Valley of Mexico, in the Aztec culture, and inconnection with sacrifice? This, and the strange resemblance of Quetzlcoatl (andKukulcan and Viracocha) to Osiris, removes such correspondences from the realmof coincidence and places them in to the category of evidence that we arelooking at the remains of a common cultural inheritance, differently construedby the legacy cultures it left behind.b. Giants and Cannibalism > Nor is this the only strange parallel between New World sacrifices and Old> World legends. There is another strange connection, this time, in legends of> cannibalistic giants: > Now, in Tollan the people were no more. > Huemac was ruler., The second was called Necuametl, the third was> Tlaltecatzin, the fourth was called Huitzilpopoca. The four were lift behind> by Topilzin when he went away. And the ruler of Nonoalco was called Huetzin… > Now then, an omen came to him; he saw an ash-bundle man, a giant. And it> was the very one who was eating people. > Then the Toltecs say, “O Toltecs, who is it that’s eating people?” > Then they snared it, they captured it. And what they captured was a> beardless boy. > Then they kill it. And when they’ve killed it, they look inside it: it has> no heart, no innards, no blood. > Then it stinks. And whoever smells it dies from it, as well as whoever> does not smell it, who (simply) passes by. And so a great many people are> dying. > Then they go to drag it away, but it cannot be moved. And when the rope> breaks, those who fall down die on the spot. And when it moves, all those who> come in contact with it die. It eats them all.13 This not only parallels accounts from the Old World identifying giants with thepractice of cannibalism, but in the Aztec context, there is a subtle implicationthat the story has something to do with the practice of human sacrifice itself,with the literal consumption of the people being “cooked” as burnt sacrificesfor the gods; the “giant,” we are told, is opened up, and there is no blood, noheart. The giant, who consumes the lives of the people, is a heartlessmachine.14c. Quetzlcoatl, Sacrifice, Payment, and “the Sorcerers” We now come to confront the issue of human sacrifice in Aztec culture, as it isrecounted in the Codex Chimalpopoca, directly. In one place, the account statesthat in the year 1487, or the year 8 Reed as the Aztecs called it, some 80,400prisoners were sacrificed on the top of the pyramid at Tenochtitlan, the Azteccapital.15 Indeed, the numbers are so staggering that one begins to wonder ifthe whole vast program of Aztec conquest was really driven by a perceived “need”for a constant supply of sacrificial victims.However, that same Codex makes it very clear that the god who was considered bythe Aztecs themselves to have founded their civilization, Quetzlcoatl, forbadeit. The following story of its origins is told, and with it, one has a furtherinsight into the Aztec version of the Masonic ritual and dedication of theTemple:> The Toltecs were engaged (in battle) at a place called Netlalpan. And when> they had taken captives, human sacrifice also got started, as Toltecs> sacrificed their prisoners. Among them and in their midst the devil Yaotl> followed along. Right on the spot he kept inciting them to make human> sacrifices. > And then, too, he started and began the practice of flaying humans… Then> he made one of the Toltecs named Ziuhcozcatl wear the skin, and he was the> first to war a totec skin. > Indeed, every kind of human sacrifice that there used to be got started> then. For it is told and related that during his time and under his authority,> the first Quetzlcoatl, whose name was Ce Acatl, absolutely refused to perform> human sacrifice. It was precisely when Huemac was ruler that all those things> that used to be done got started. It was the devils who started them. But this> has been put on paper and written down elsewhere. And there it is to be heard. > … Huemac sacrificed a human streamer, thus making payment.16 There are three things to notice here:> 1) Sacrifice is considered a payment, i.e., something that is owed, and> hence, the implied concept is that there is a debt to be paid, for whatever> reason;> 2) Sacrifice was not the original order of society, but was instituted at> some later period by devils; and,> 3) it was instituted by one devil in particular, someone named Yaotl, whose> name contains the root “Ya” and who both in name and in character sounds more> than a little like the “Yahweh” of the Torah, the first five books of the Old> Testament, who takes such delight in smelling the aroma of sacrificed animals.One final thing should also be noted before we continue, and that is that thename “Quetzlcoatl” appears to be understood by the Aztecs to be a titular name,the name of an office as much as it is the name of a person, and office similarin nature to the Mayans’ description, “Sovereign Plumed Serpent.”The idea of “devils” having been behind the institution of sacrifice is furtherelaborated: > 7 Rabbit (1018). Here began the sacrifice of the human streamers. At that> time, in the time of 7 Rabbit, a great famine occurred. What is said is that> the Toltecs were seven-rabbited. It was a seven-year famine, a famine that> caused much suffering and death. > It was then that the sorcerers requisitioned Huemac’s own children and> went and left them in the waters of Xochiquetzal and on Huitzco and on> Xicocotl, thus making payment with little children. This was the first time> that the sacrifice of human streamers occurred.17 We have already encountered Huemac as one of the Aztec kings mentioned in theCodex Chimalpopoca, but now we learn of another presence behind the practice ofhuman sacrifice: sorcerers, in addition to devils. In other words, the Aztecmythology is suggesting that we are looking at the activity of an initiatedelite. And once again, sacrifice is referred to as a payment. It is thusdifficult to avoid the conclusion that the “devils” were the ones demandingpayment.However, of all the suggestive passages in the Codex that refer to humansacrifice, one in particular stands out above all the rest for the breadth ofits implications. > Well, it is told and related that many times during the life of Quetzlcoatl,> sorcerers tried to ridicule him into making the human payment, into taking> human lives. But he always refused. He did not consent, because he greatly> loved his subjects, who were Toltecs. Snakes, birds, and butterflies that he> killed were what his sacrifices always were. > And it is told and related that with this he wore out the sorcerers’> patience. So it was then that they started to ridicule him and make fun of> him, the sorcerers saying they wanted to torment Quetzlcoatl and make him run> away. > And it became true. It happened. > … > Then they tell how Quetzlcoatl departed. It was when he refused to obey> the sorcerers about making the human payment, about sarificing humans. Then> the sorcerers deliberated among themselves, they whose names were> Texcatlipoca, Ihuimecatly, and Toltecatly. They said, “He must leave his city.> We shall live there.”18 This is a significant passage, for in it one finds the clear outlines of apeculiar story emerging: > 1) The “old order,” represented by Quetzlcoatl, which refuses to institute> human sacrifice;> 2) The “new order” represented by three sorcerers, who eventually force> Quetzlcoatl to abandon his city and take it over. These three sorcerers, along> with King Quetzlcoatl, represent yet another variation, perhaps, of the Aztec> version of the Hiram Abiff story, with the dedication of a temple by> sacrifice;> 3) Sacrifice is again referred to as a “payment,” a debt, and Quetzlcoatl’s> refusal to institute the practice is, perhaps, suggestive of the fact that he> did not accept the whole notion of payment and debt to begin with.To put it succinctly, it would appear that one is looking at two ideologies, twoconceptions, of the place of mankind within the vast “cosmic machine,” an olderone, and a newer one, represented by Queztlcoatl and the sorcerers respectively.Those sorcerers were elsewhere called “devils,” and one in particular, “Yaotl,”was behind the practice.All of this occurs in the post-Flood world of the Fifth Sun, so it is importantto note one final thing. After the flood, the gods create “a new sun from theflames of the ‘spirit oven’ at Teotihuacan…”19 The notion of sacrifice, in otherwords, was deeply tied to the most mysterious site on the world Grid in all ofthe Americas, as it was also tied to the notion of a recreation, arevitalization, of the sun and celestial machinery itself.But before we look at the implications of these ideas at Teotihuacan, a closerlook at the notion of sacrifice, payment, and debt in the culture thatconfronted the Aztecs is in order.B. Sacrificial Atonement in Latin Christianity:Anselm of Canterbury’s Cur Deus Homo All across Western Europe, from whence the Conquistadores came, sacrifice wasbeing offered in all the hamlet chapels, parish churches, deaneries,monasteries, and cathedrals of Europe: the sacrifice of the mass. Moreover, itwould not take a great deal to show that many of these chapels, churches, andcathedrals were built over old pagan shrines or cult centers, occupying placeson the world Grid. In brief, the sacrifice of the mass was understood to be asupremely alchemical act, the transubstantiation of earthly bread and wine intothe heavenly body and blood of Christ, which had been sacrificed to God theFather at the Crucifixion. It was an act that made that sacrifice reallypresent.Two cultures, both of them practicing sacrifice of some sort, thus confrontedeach other, and though it could be said that the Spanish were hardly practicingactual human sacrifice, a closer look at the theological doctrine underlyingWestern Latin Christian belief will reveal that there was no great broadconceptual ocean dividing the two cultures, but rather the reverse, that much ofthe language and conceptulization behind both cultures’ practice and belief wasthe same.For the western Latin Church, the constellation of ideas surrounding thesacrifice of Christ were most completely enunciated by the 11th centurytheologian, Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury (1033-1109), in a work entitled CurDeus Homo, or Why the God-Man? Here, the “logic” of sacrifice, debt, and paymentis laid out clearly, and with a cold-bloodedness that lies just hidden beneaththe surface language of piety.The first indicator that even Christ Himself is viewed as but a cog in a vastsacrificial “machine” is found in the opening lines of the Cur Deus Homo, thevery lines that formed the epigraph to this chapter: “…in fine, leaving Christout of view (as if nothing had ever been known of him), it proves, by absolutereasons, the impossibility that any man should be saved without him.”20 In otherwords, once Christ is out of view, then it is the “absolute reasons” that formthe basis of the machine of sacrifice into which Christ steps as “the essentialcog.”A reading of a few select passages will make this clear.1. Debt and Will The Cur Deus Homo is laid out as a set of dialogues between Anselm and hispupil, Boso. We begin our examination of the logic of sacrifice in Anselm withthis exchange between the archbishop and his student in chapter IX of the CurDeus: > Boso: …How it was of his own accord that he died, and what this means: “he was> made obedient even unto death; “ and: “for which cause God hath highly exalted> him;” and: “I came not to do my own will; “ and: “he spared not his own Son;”> and: “not as I will, but as thou wilt.” > Anselm: It seems to me that you do not rightly understand the difference> between what he did at the demand of obedience, and what he suffered, not> demanded by obedience, but inflicted on him, because he kept his obedience> perfect. > … > That man, therefore, owed this obedience to God the Father, humanity to Deity;> and the Father claimed it from him. > Boso: …For death was inflicted on him for his perseverance in obedience and he> endured it; but I do not understand how it is that obedience did not demand> this. > … > Anselm: …It may, indeed be said, that the Father commanded him to die, when he> enjoined that upon him on account of which he met death…And this, since none> other could accomplish it, availed as much with the Son, who so earnestly> desired the salvation of man, as if the Father had commanded him to die; and,> therefore, “as the Father gave him commandment, so he did, and the cup which> the Father gave to him he drank, being obedient even unto death.” Note the curious statement “since none other could accomplish it,” a statementthat many interpreters take as referring to the insufficiency and weakness ofthe human will and its inability not to sin. Christ, as a “perfect man”presumably does not suffer this weakness, and therefore, is able to offer aperfect obedience.But this would be to reduce Anselm’s argument, for this is not the only“absolute reason” that he has in mind.2. Debt, Payment, and Satisfaction That “absolute reason” is revealed by what Anselm has to say about the ideas ofdebt, payment, and satisfaction in chapter twelve of the Cur Deus:> Anselm: Let us return and consider whether it were proper for God to put away> sins by compassion alone, without any payment of the honor taken from him. > … > But if sin is neither paid for nor punished, it is subject to no law. Here the notion of payment and debt becomes more fully defined: it is a “paymentfor the honor taken” from God by man.This is further elaborated in chapter nineteen: > Anselm: Therefore, consider it settled that, without satisfaction, that is,> without voluntary payment of the debt, God can neither pass by the sin> unpunished, nor can the sinner attain that happiness, or happiness like that,> which he had before he sinned; for man cannot in this way be restored, or> become such as he was before he sinned. > Boso: …For, if we pay our debt, why do we pray God to put it away? Is not God> unjust to demand what has already been paid? But if we do not make payment,> why do we supplicate in vain that he will do what he cannot do, because it is> unbecoming? > Anselm: He who does not pay says in vain: “Pardon”; but he who pays makes> supplication, because prayer is properly connected with the payment; for God> owes no man anything, but every creature owes God… Here the language of “debt” and “payment” has come fully out into the open, butnote, that in the implicit logic of Anselm’s argument, both God and man arecaught as cogs in a machine of higher logic, that of an abstract justicedemanding punishment and satisfaction for sin. Lest this point be missed, Anselmis really saying that there is no intrinsic forgiveness whatsoever; there is nofiat of forgiveness without the shedding of blood.This gruesome logic is elaborated even further in chapters twenty throughtwenty-three:> Anselm: Neither, I think, will you doubt this, that satisfaction should be> proportionate to guilt. > … > When you render anything to God which you owe him, irrespective of your past> sin, you should not reckon this as the debt which you owe for sin. But you owe> God every one of those things which you have mentioned…. > Boso: Truly I dare not say that in all these things I pay any portion of my> debt to God. > Anselm: How then do you pay God for your transgression? > Boso: If in justice I owe God myself and all my powers, even when I do not> sin, I have nothing left to render to him for my sin. > Anselm: What will become of you then? How will you be saved? > … > (We) set aside Christ and his religion as if they did not exist, when we> proposed to inquire whether his coming were necessary to man’s salvation. > (CHAPTER XXI) > … > Anselm: Therefore you make no satisfaction unless you restore something> greater than the amount of that obligation, which should restrain you from> committing the sin. Here the implicit logic is finally revealed, for mankind owes a debt that hecannot repay, yet, since it is mankind that owes the debt, he must repay.And this leads to the heart of the logic of Anselm’s “machine of sacrifice.”3. Infinite Debt, Infinite Payment, and the InternalLogic of the Sacrifice of Christ According to Anselm Mankind owes a debt that is, in effect, infinite, since his sin was — as wasseen in the citations above — an affront to the honor of God, an honor one canonly assume was infinite, like God Himself. Because of this, the infinite debtcan only be “paid off” or “satisfied” by an infinite payment, yet, mankind hadto pay it, since he himself owed it. And thus we come to the heart of the CurDeus Homo, the Why the God-Man, for only God, by coming man, could both satisfy,and pay, the abstract infinite debt, as is enunciated in Book II, chapters sixand seven of the Cur Deus:> Anselm: But this cannot be effected, except the price paid to God for the sin> of man be something greater than all the universe besides God. > Boso: So it appears. > Anselm: Moreover, it is necessary that he who can give God anything of his own> which is more valuable than all things in the possession of God, must be> greater than all else but God himself. > Boso: I cannot deny it. > Anselm: Therefore none but God can make this satisfaction. > Boso: So it appears. > Anselm: But none but a man ought to do this, other wise man does not make the> satisfaction. > Boso: Nothing seems more just. > (CHAPTER VII) > Anselm: … For God will not do it, because he has no debt to pay; and man will> not do it, because he cannot. Therefore, in order that the God-man may perform> this, it is necessary that the same being should be perfect God and perfect> man, in order to make this atonement. And with those statements, Anselm has reduced God, man, and Christ as cogs in akind of “accounting” adjustment as vast cogs in an impersonal machine of justiceand sacrifice. Anselm “wins” the argument, and his disciple Boso summarizes thisprinciple in chapter eighteen of Book Two:> Boso: …And you, by numerous and positive reasons, have shown that the> restoring of mankind ought not to take place, and could not, without man paid> the debt which he owed God for his sin. And this debt was so great that, while> none but man must solve the debt, none but God was able to do it; so that he> who does it must be both God and man. And hence arises a necessity that God> should take man into unity with his own person; so that he who in his own> nature was bound to pay the debt, but could not, might be able to do it in the> person of God. Pause and consider quite carefully what this means. On Anselm’s view, God is abanker, and Christ is less a person than an action of sacrifice balancing thebooks; all other aspects of the life and teaching of Christ are, really, merelysuperfluous to this overriding sacrificial necessity. On this view, even lifeitself is an indebtedness, and this reveals the flaw in Anselm’s logic, for iflife itself is an indebtedness, could mankind ever sufficiently “honor God” topay back the debt of life?There is, of course, a further flaw in Anselm, and it is a moral one, for itmakes God the Father demand the death-by-torture of his own Son to satisfy anaffront to His honor, an act that, even on human terms, seems neither just norbefitting a “God of Love,” and an action few, if any, human fathers would everdemand.We are dealing, in short, with a kind of closed “economico- theological” system,with God’s honor as the interest, and mankind the principal and collateral onit.With this view of mankind as a mechanism in a machine, let us now return to theAztecs, to Teotihuacan, and look more closely at the possible physicsconnections.C. Teotihuacan Teotihuacan may rightly be said to be the Giza of the Americas. Its massivePyramid of the Sun and Pyramid of the Moon dominate the Valley of Mexico, andtheir names themselves are both specifically mentioned in the local native lore,and were adopted by the Aztecs themselves when they moved into the Valley.21 Thename Teotihuacan itself means “city of the gods.” Indeed, the emperor Montezumahimself thought that the Pyramid of the Sun was the “original primeval moundmarking the spot where creation had been set in motion at the beginning of thepresent epoch of the earth.”22 In this, as we shall discover, the Aztecs echoedthe Egyptians, who also regarded their great pyramids at Giza as representingthe primeval mountains of creation.In other words, the pyramids of Teotihuacan and in particular the Pyramid of theSun were regarded as somehow fundamentally connected to the cosmologicalprocesses of creation itself. For the Aztecs, as for the Egytptians, they were,in some rudimentary sense, understood to be machines manipulating the physics ofthe cosmological process of creation and destruction itself at the highest,topological level.However, for the Aztecs, unlike for the Egyptians, that manipulation wasaccomplished through the barbaric practice of human sacrifice, a practiceoverseen by priests who, according to Nahuatl tradition, directed sacrifices aspart of the ritual of immortality and ascension connected with the pyramids.23Before proceeding to a more detailed examination, it is worth speculating on whysacrifice was thought, in some manner, to be connected with pyramids,immortality, and the manipulation of the medium.We have already noted that pyramids were understood by the Meso-Americans, insome rudimentary form, as machines directly linked to the cosmological processesof creation, to a physics. As I have also noted in my book The Cosmic War, someof the ancient technologies seem to have been operable, or were perceived asbeing operable, only in close conjunction or actual physical contact with theirpossessors.24 It is also known that the Aztecs in particular practiced humansacrifice with what may best be described as reckless abandon, as if, somehow,the sheer numbers and emotional trauma associated with them somehow enhanced theeffect - whatever it was perceived to be - of the practice. Taking the Aztec andMayan myths as our clue, we may conclude that at some point during thedevelopment of the Grid, that an elite arose - or perhaps simply asserted itself- that understood that there was a direct effect of consciousness upon thephysical medium, and through the practice of massive human sacrifice, wasattempting literally to “traumatize” or “shock” it.Turning to Teotihuacan itself, it is to be noted that the site is very ancient,and bears the marks of several eras of construction.25 The problem is, that noone really knows who built it, nor really, when it was built. Indeed, when theConquistadors discovered the site,> No one could tell them who had built the great ceremonial center, whence the> builders had come, or whither they had gone. All they could learn was that two> centuries earlier, when the Mexica had arrived in the valley, they had found> the mysterious city already in an abandoned condition, covered with earth and> vegetation.26 The presence not only of vegetation but of earth covering the monuments ofTeotihuacan suggests that when the Aztecs came upon the site, it had beenabandoned for some time.There is loosely corroborating support for the antiquity of this site from Mayantexts, Aztec mythology and ritual practices. Peter Tompkins notes that theAztecs and Mayans may have inherited the practice of human sacrifice from somecontact with the Phoenicians, who were the ultimate practitioners of childsacrifice. Citing the work of archaeologist Hugh Fox, Tompkins notes that thepractice of sacrifice in the Old World, emerged after the Flood in conjunctionwith an attempt to appease the gods and ward off another catastrophe, aconjunction of ideas also apparently at work in Mayan and Aztec thinking.27 TheMayan Troano Codex spoke of a great catastrophe that had sunk an island in theAtlantic Ocean “extending eastward in a crescent as far as the Canary Islands”ca. 9937 BC.28 The close proximity of this date to the 10,500 BC date mentionedelsewhere should be noted, for again it suggests that one is looking at a commoncultural inheritance spanning the globe.It is fairly certain that the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan was oncededicated to the Sovereign Plumed Serpent, Quetzcoatl, for the Mexicanarchaeologist Batras discovered many worked shells depicting snakes on andaround the pyramid during his excavations of the site in the early twentiethcentury.29However, there was a much deeper mystery concerning the Pyramid of the Sun, onesuggesting that the structure was conceived for some machine-like function:> An unpublished find on the fifth level has never been adequately explained.> While the Sun Pyramid was first being probed by Batras in 1906, an> archeologist working with him reported a thick sheet of mica covering the top> of the fifth body. This material was apparently carried away during the course> of the restoration. > Coincidentally, a “Temple of Mica” was also found to the south of the Sun> Pyramid about 350 meters down the Way of the Dead, where the local guard will> still let one peek through a glass panel at the floor covered with mica slabs.> Mica has two outstanding characteristics: high electrical resistance and> opaqueness to fast neutrons. Hence it acts as an insulator or nuclear reaction> moderator, which raises the question as to why two separate areas of> Teotihuacan were covered with mica.30 In addition to these properties, mica may also be used in the manufacture ofcapacitors and as an insulator in high voltage machines.While mica was used in ancient times for purposes other than these modern ones,its presence in the Pyramid of the Sun, plus the structure’s possible antiquity,suggests that one may not too easily close the door on the possibility that itspresence served some functional purpose. In this case, there are three possibleproperties: > 1) as an electrical insulator;> 2) as a dielectric in a capacitor; and> 3) as a nuclear moderator.Given these choices, one may speculate that perhaps the first two usages wereintended by the structure’s builders, but we will have to reserve any furthercommentary about this structure and its possible functional purpose for apossible future sequel on the Grid.Munck notes that the Teotihuacan-Giza parallelism is quite acute, for the threemain pyramids of Giza, Mycerinus, Cephren, and the Great Pyramid itself, areexact analogies to the Moon Pyramid, the Sun Pyramid, and the “Quetzlcoatl”complex at Teotihuacan.31 And both these places with their three main structuresare, as most know, laid out according to the patterns of the stars of theconstellation Orion’s “belt.” For our purposes, however, we make an assumption,and note one thing. The assumption - which will be argued in chapter thirteen -is that we are looking an machines designed to engineer a hyper-dimensionalphysics. Once we have granted that assumption, then something immediatelyfollows: Giza and Teotihuacan are designed according to the same basic plan,that is to say, they could be coupled oscillators to each other in some fashion.Munck makes some crucial observations regarding the most massive structure atTeotihuacan, the Pyramid of the Sun, and these play directly into ourassumptions that we are looking at “hyper- dimensional engineering.” A glance atthis structure in side elevation, courtesy of the detailed line drawings ofengineer Hugh Harleston, Jr., is in order.image [images/00070.jpg] Hugh Harleston Jr’s Side Elevation view of the Pyramid of the Sun.Note that all measures are given in meters.32 Note, says Munck, that the pyramid is deliberately offset, much like the“temples” of Tikal.33 The offset, moreover, occurs on the level of the secondterrace, and of all five terraces, only the lower two are centered. Followinghis method of counting faces and sides, this gives Munck the followinginteresting set of numbers: > 1) Centered terraces:  2> 2) Faces on one side elevation of the pyramid 6> 3) Number of terraces  5> 4) Offset faces on one side elevation 434Taking each of these numbers times π times each other, e.g., 2π x 4π x 5π x 6πyields 23,378,.18184, which translates to 19o 41’ when converted to normaldegrees measures.35 This is, of course, our first clue that we are indeeddealing with a hyper-dimensional structure, for the first of the Platonicsolids, a tetrahedron, is circumscribed in a sphere, with on vertex on therotational axis, will have the other three vertices touching at 19 degrees 47minutes north or south latitude, depending upon which rotational pole the fourthvertex is positioned. And was we shall see in chapter thirteen, this is aprofound clue to hyper-dimensional geometries, to geometries done in more thanthree spatial dimensions.Here we must begin, however, to take some issue with Munck, for from a strictlygeometrical perspective, there is no difference between terraces and faces; fora geometer, they are both the same. Additionally, we would have to multiply hisnumbers by four, since there are four sides to the structure (remember, theterraces count as one face since they extend around the entire structure, so wedo not multiply them by four).We would get the following adjusted table of numbers: > 1) Centered faces (i.e., faces and terraces) 10> 2) Offset faces (i.e., faces and terraces) 19> 3) total faces (i.e., all faces and terraces) 29Note that we are counting only the faces of the basic structure, not the facesthat would be added from the staircases and so on. Now there are two morenumbers that should be added to this list: corners and edges:> 4) Number of corners, or vertices 44> 5) Number of edges  78As we shall see in chapter thirteen, these sorts of numbers are stronglysuggestive of strange sorts of hyper-dimensional objects called compounds,though as we shall also see, there is a problem. But nonetheless, these sorts ofnumbers permit us to offer yet another speculation about what kind of machinesthey are: by dint of the numbers of faces edges, and vertices embodied in theirnumbers, these objects appear to be constructed as three-dimensional analoguesof higher-dimensional objects, as resonators of them.If this sounds like the flights of purest science fiction fantasy, it isn’t, forthe mathematician Hugh Harleston Jr, whose diagrams we have been utilizing,noticed the same thing about the musical and tetrahedral properties ofTeotihuacan, and its relationship to the physics of the medium:> The angles and perspectives in the Teotihuacan layout appear to Harleston to> show the framework of an integrated earth and heaven - along with the> megaspace of the heavens above - as being the work of a master mathematician.> To Harleston the messages of Teotihuacan point to a new way of looking at time> and space, and to some new source of energy from the cosmos, some new field> fabric that our science has not yet isolated… > Harleston says that once the student at Teotihuacan learned the important> values of thirds, sevenths, and ninths, that squares and sqaure roots were> basic mathematical tools, the next step was to understand the relationship of> two simple geometric solids: the sphere and the tetrahedron. > It was some time before Harleston found the clue to a tetrahedral geometry> incorporated into the Teotihuacan complex, but he finally found it in the> dimensions of the Pyramid of the Sun. Unlike the Pyramid of Cheops, which is a> very exact scale model of the Northern Hemisphere (with the apex as the North> Pole, the base as the equator, and its perimeter equal to one-half minute of> arc), the Sun Pyramid does not fit such a system; it does, however, very> accurately give the entire surface of the earth.36 Why is this so? because as we have already seen, the tetrahedral number of 19.5is already approximated in the structure in terms of its number of faces and π.But there is also another way it is incorporated: > Oddly, or coincidentally, the relation between a tetrahedron and a sphere> constitutes the thrust of the work of Buckminster Fuller, who, in his book> Synergetics, maintains that the tetrahedron gives the basic mathematical> blueprint for the universe. > From what he calls his “isotropic vector matrix” Fuller obtains a constant> of √9/8, which comes to `1.065066, so close to Harleston’s 1.059 constant that> it fits the Teotihuacan complex virtually as well.37 This tetrahedral redundancy that was built into Teotihuacan was not lost onHarleston: > Pointing out that the carbon atom - which is the basic building block from> which the material bodies of all living organisms are made - is a regular> tetrahedron, and that the water molecule has characteristics that conform to> the tetrahedral structure, Harleston concludes that the fundamental message> conveyed by the Teotihuacanos is that the physical universe is tetrahedral> from the microscopic level of the atom all the way up to the macroscopic level> of the galaxies on a scale of vibrations in which man stands about the center.> Man would thus have built into him, as suggested by Pythagoras and Plato, the> tool for unlocking the geometry of the cosmos and recovering the knowledge of> his role in the scheme.38 Those numbers, 9 and 8, and those mystics, Pythagoras and Plato, we shallencounter again in the next chapter, and man’s unique position, as the microcosmand mediator in this cosmic, tetrahedral temple, we shall have much occasion tocomment on in the fourth part of this book in connection with Egypt.That positioning of man somewhere in the middle of all this physics, however,does suggest one final, significant clue as to why human sacrifice was practicedby some with a possible understanding of this physics, of the analogical natureof consciousness itself, and of the analogical view of the physical medium whichthe ancients held, for standing midway between the physics of the very small andthe very large, man himself was the natural and most efficient resonator of allthose things. For those intending to exercise power and influence over themedium via its interface with consciousness, through the instrumentality ofshock and emotional trauma induced within it by brutality and sacrifice, theselection of mankind is in some sense the manifestation of a twisted logic and atwisted music.39But the original music, echoed from the Vedas down through Mesopotamia andEgypt, must now come into view, to see just how twisted that logic really was.

McClain1No survey of the underlying physics of the world Grid system would be completewithout a mention of Mesopotamia, for it is there, in the crossroads of theancient Middle East, that the cultures of Egypt, Sumer, Babylon and India, met.Indeed, more than one author has commented on the peculiar links of Mesopotamiancivilization to the ancient Vedic civilizations,2 and it could be said with somejustification that Mesopotamia owes its sophistication and cosmology to thelegacy of the East. It is there that the planetary motions were fused withnumber theory and music to an extraordinary degree.Plato himself, as we shall see, owed much of his numerical codes to theinfluence of Pythagoreanism, and that in turn owed much to Mesopotamiancivilizations. A proper understanding of the Grid system and the cosmologiesthat underwrote it cannot therefore be had without a consideration of themassive influence that the civilizations “between the rivers” had on itsdevelopment, and in particular, on the development of music. In thisunderstanding, no work is more magisterial and important than that of ProfessorErnest G. McClain.A. The Unified Intention of Symbol and Musical Codes In my previous books I have spoken at length about a conception that I call “theunified intention of symbol,” i.e., the idea that ancient myths were carefullycomposed, multi-leveled structures designed to encode a massive amount oftechnical information that could be decoded when science had advanced to asimilar state of development as the society that originally created the myths.3It has been my assumption that this “mythological creation” was the deliberateact of a post-cosmic war elite or elites seeking a method to enshrine andtransmit technical information in a form that would last over time. If studiessuch as De Santillana and Von Dechend’s Hamlet’s Mill, or Ernest G. McClain’sPythagorean Plato and The Myth of Invariance are any indicators, the program waswildly successful, for those myths, from Scandinavia to Polynesia, encode awealth of astronomical, geometric, and musical data.1. Music as the First Physical Unification and the MusicalMeanings of Pantheons I am not the only one, by any means, to have noticed this multi- leveled, almostparonomasial symbolism at work in ancient myths. Commenting on this phenomenonin the Vedic texts, McClain observes that there are at least four “languages” ormodes of expression at work simultaneously: > 1) the language of Non-Existence (Asat),> 2) the language of Existence (Sat),> 3) the language of Images and Sacrifice (Yajna), and> 4) the language of Embodied (Rta) Vision (Dhih).> These four languages are the expressions of a sensorium which organizes itself> primarily on a model of sound.4It is the recurrence of similar numbers, in a similar order, from the Rig Vedasof India, and on into Babylon, Egypt, and Greece that indicates an underlying,common spiritual and philosophical tradition. Indeed, for McClain, music was“the one force capable of projecting a philosophical synthesis” because musicwas the first physical unification.5 This musical code manifests itself, withinthe Vedic tradition, as hymns and musical numerology that link Sun, Moon, theplanets, to the Indian pantheon “in which sons create their own mothers and allare counted.”6In the effort to decode these musical-numeric codes, Plato is, for McClain, akind of Rosetta Stone “to the more obscure science of earlier cultures.”7 Of allthese cultures, the Vedic was by far the oldest, and its myths and hymns were,in fact, codes of a musical science:> The numbers Rgvedic man cared about define alternate tunings for the musical> scale. The hymns describe the numbers poetically, distinguish “sets” by> classes of gods and demons, and portray tonal and arithmetical relations with> graphic sexual and spatial metaphor. Vedic concerns were with those> invariances which became the focus of attention in Greek tuning theory.> Because the poets limited themselves to integers, or natural numbers, and> consistently used the smallest integers possible in every tonal context, they> made it possible for us to rediscover their constructions by the methods of> Pythagorean mathematical harmonics.8 We may now add to the accumulated levels of meaning associated with the “unifiedintention of symbol” a new understanding of “gods:” > 1) At the most prosaic level, the gods represent real “people” or beings who> interact with humanity;> 2) At a second, deeper level, the names of gods might be titular, as denoting> a planet or its ruler, or ruling house;9 and now we have, in addition to this,> 3) At a third level, the names of classes of gods also represent sets of> notes generated by certain mathematical relationships.There is a clue here, for as was seen in my book The Cosmic War, there is yetanother formula which emerges from Mesopotamian and Egyptian texts: > Mountains ≈ Planets ≈Gods ≈ Pyramids,10 where the symbol ≈ means “is> associated with.” We may now add a new component to this formula: Mountains ≈ Planets ≈ Gods ≈Pyramids ≈ Music. But why associate music with mountains, pyramids and planets?The answer to that question emerges from a careful consideration of McClain’sdecoding of the “musical paleophysics” of the myths of Pythagoreanism andPlatonism. It is music that adds a hierarchy of order to the otherwise infiniteand chaotic series of numbers:> What we are investigating then, is actually a realm of number theory in which> music sets the problems, since musical patterns elevate certain numbers to a> prominence pure number theory would not accord them. Musical values introduce> a hierarchy into the number field: as we shall show… even numbers which define> the octave matrix are “female,” odd numbers which fill the matrix with> “tone-children” are “male,” and the smaller numbers define intervals of> greater importance.11 Or to put it into terms reminiscent of Rene Schwaller de Lubicz, music denotesthe functions that numbers symbolize.What certain numerical relationships in ancient mythological texts are actuallydoing, in other words, are defining systems of tuning in the attempt to reducethe chaos of the harmonic series to an engineerable order. Why this is sorequires a little explanation by way of a simple illustration.Every musical tone has a natural harmonic series of overtones extending aboveand below it into infinity. The problem is, that each “overtone” or “harmonic”decreases in interval relationship to its fundamental the higher one goes. Ifone sits at an acoustic piano, presses the note “C” down silently, and then hitsthe note “C” an octave lower, one will hear this silently pressed “C” vibratingin sympathetic resonance with the struck note. Now, go up a fifth to the note“G”, and repeat the experiment. Silently press down “G” while hitting the note“C”. Again, one will hear the silently held note “G” vibrating sympatheticallywith the struck note “C”. Again, go up a fourth — note that the interval isdiminishing — to another note “C,” press it silently, and hit the note “C” twooctaves below it. Again, the silently held “C” will vibrate.Repeating this process will inevitably lead to a note that does not exist on thepiano keyboard, but that does exist in the natural harmonic series of “C”, andthat note lies in the crack between A and Bb. And as the intervals continue todiminish, more and more notes are added that do not exist on the keyboard. Ourmodern music, and particularly keyboard instruments, have been tempered or tunedto an artificially engineered overtone series that allows all twelve noteswithin an octave on the keyboard to function in any key of music, without havingto stop to retune the whole instrument in order to do so.Plato, in his Republic, encoded this “equal tempering” as a politicalphilosophy: “The necessity of tempering the pure intervals, defined by theratios of integers” that is to say, the harmonic series as it naturally occurswith its infinite overtones for each note, “is one of the great themes ofPlato’s Republic. In his allegorical form, ‘citizens’ modeled on the tones ofthe scale must not demand ‘exactly what they are owed,’ but must keep in mind‘what is best for the city.’”12 That is to say, they must be willing to submitto a slight mathematical adjustment to allow them to function with each other ina harmonious fashion.The number twelve here is a key, for it points directly to Mesopotamia and toits “sexagesimal” numerical system, a system that as we shall see wastaylor-made to solve the tuning problem, and to a secret held by those culturesand passed down through the Pythagoreans. It points also to the twelve houses ofthe zodiac, and with that, the connection between music and astronomy comes alittle closer into view.B. Music, the Alchemical Medium, and Astronomy The Vedic tradition is full of allusions to the “luminous nature of sound”.Indeed, the word for light (svar) is similar to the word for sound (svara).13This, as I have observed elsewhere, is another clue that perhaps we are viewinga legacy of a lost sophistication in physics, for the idea of a “sound-light”can also be understood as “electro-acoustic,” i.e., as longitudinal electricalwaves in the medium, recalling the “Sound-Eye” spoken of in the Egyptian Edfutexts.14The regularity of that physical medium was, for the ancient mind, expressed inthe regularity of the cyclic nature of the heavens, and the precession of theequinoxes through a long cycle through the twelve houses of the Zodiac. Twelve,then, became the number of choice for expressing the musical harmony of thespheres. We may illustrate this by again sitting at an acoustic piano, andplaying through the circle of perfect fourths and fifths: Circle of Fourths (Asdending)1) C2) F3) Bb4) Eb5) Ab6) Db7) Gb/F#8) B9)E10) A11) D12) G13) (C)Circle of Fifths, Descending (Reading the above chart bottom to top)Again, the notes we play are not the result of the natural overtone series, butof a tempering or “tampering with” by means of a mathematical adjustment toharmonize with the celestial motions of precession through the twelve houses ofthe Zodiac. As McClain states it, “Ancient cosmology required just enough numbertheory and just enough musical theory to harmonize the heavens with the scaleand the calendar.”15 The musical allegory is expressed in poetic terms in theRig Veda > Formed with twelve spokes, by length of > time, unweakened, rolls round the > heaven, this wheel of during order. > Twelve are the fellies, and the wheel is single.16 This astronomical and calendrical correspondence is even evident if one playsthe white keys of the C major scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, for these seven toneswere understood to represent not only the seven day week, but, in Vedictradition, the Seven Rishis or Seven Sages.17The Rig Veda also knows and speaks of the primary “tripartation” that wediscovered in connection with Angkor Wat and Vishnu’s triadicself-manifestation:> The Gods are later than this world’s production, > Who knows then whence it first came into being?18 That is to say, all the multiplicities of the god-notes follow upon that firsttripartation.But what happens, then, if we take thirds, or the powers of three, and followthose around “a circle of thirds”? The result is perplexing, for if we startagain at C, and follow intervals of a major third, we get the following: 1) C2) E3) G#/Ab4) CWe are far short of generating the twelve equidistant tones of the circles offourths and fifths. In other words, the primary mathematical and musical problemfaced by ancient civilizations, was how to reconcile the two “sets” of god-tonesinto a harmonious whole. This leads us inevitably to a consideration of the “female” and “male” numbersof the ancient tuning systems.C. The Male and Female Numbers and the Physical Medium The image of the musical circle was one that haunted the Vedic literature.> The chariot of the gods is actually a “wheel-less car… fashioned mentally”> (10.135.3). The Celestial Race itself “was made by singers with their lips,”> and the same singers “with their mind formed horses harnessed by a word” to> drive the chariot,” a light car moving every way (1.20.1–3). Of the car> itself, in what I assume to be an allusion to rotation and counter-rotation in> the tone-circle, we hear that it “works on either side,” the car-pole to which> the horses are harnessed thus “turning every way” (10.102.1 and 10.135.3).19 In other words, the primary feature of the physical medium in view in theancient cosmology was its rotational frequency, and the resulting “music”therefrom.Frequency is the key here, for it shows how and why the ancients approached thesubject of tuning via whole number integers and ratios. Suppose you are sittingat the massive console of a pipe organ. Before you are five octaves on itsvarious keyboards, beginning with the lowest note, “C” on your left. You pull aneight foot stop, say, the stop Prinzipal. On the stop knob there is a number 8followed by a foot sign, thusly: 8’.20 This means that the pipe, from the mouthto the tip, is exactly eight feet long, and will sound the note “C”. Go up anoctave, and the pipe will be exactly four feet long, and so on.We thus have the ratio 8:4, which reduces to 2:1, which reduces even further, to2. Two thus becomes the ancient number assigned to the octave of any note. It isa “female” number, and with this, occurs another problem:> The number 2 is “female” in the sense that it creates the matrix, the octave,> in which all other tones are born. By itself, however, it can only create> “cycles of barrenness.” In Socrates’ metaphor, for multipication and division> by 2 can never introduce new tones into our tone-mandala. In musical> arithmetic, the powers of 2 (2±n) generate cyclic identities; that is, they> leave the musical relationship of the octave cycle invariant.21 Previously we saw how the primordial Nothing tripartitioned itself into Vishnu’sprimordial trinitarian manifestation.McClain speaks of this same thing, and now we come to the musical application ofour previous topological analysis. McClain obserfved that “the starting point ofthe Rg Veda’s intentional life is the Asat, the non-existent, “the wholeundifferentiated primordial chaos…”22 Thus, the sexual metaphor also enters thepicture:> It is a theme of much ancient mythology that the Divine Unity is a> hermaphrodite, producing a daughter, “2,” by a process of division without> benefit of of a mother. God is “1”, but he cannot preocreate except via his> daughter, “2,” the female principle and mother of all.23 But this, as we saw in our topological commentary on Angkor Wat, is not strictlytrue. It is not the number two which is first produced, but the number three,corresponding to the two regions of “differentiated Nothing” sharing a commonsurface. The common surface of the two regions becomes the topological symbol ofthe octave matrix, the regions defined by it.To put it in terms of the numerical ratios that would have been used by theancients, a primordial unity, once differentiated, gave rise to a primordial“triad,” and two is the arithmetic mean between the two: 1+3=4/2=2. In otherwords, our “ancient topological metaphor” is also a musical metaphor. The oddnumbers are thus “male” numbers, including 1, 3, and especially 5, since thesenumbers, 3 and 5, generate the differentiation of tones within the octave“mother” or matrix.24 In this, the “female principle was deified, but it wasexclusively the male element on which the world developed and differentiateditself.”25 Thus, Plato could define a father as “‘the model in whose likenessthat which becomes is born.’ The only fathers we need from here on are ‘3’ and‘5,’ which appear to have meant in the Rg Veda exactly what they meant longafterward in the Republic.”26 The powers of three, and the multiples of threeand five, define the eleven tones of our modern equally-tempered chromaticscale.27But why would ancient cosmological-musical systems equate femininity with theoctave, and masculinity with the differentiating process that gave rise to(tonal and topological) diversity? We are perhaps here in the presence ofanother clue to the degree of sophisticated scientific knowledge bequeathed as alegacy to these ancient civilizations, for as modern genetics now knows, femalescarry only the female sexual chromosome, but males carry both sexual chromosomesand are capable of biologically reproducing either a male or female offspring.There is, as it were, a kind of inbuilt androgyny to the male that does notexist in the female. This might account for the assignation of “maleness” tothose arithmetic ratios of odd numbers that produced differentiation in thegeneration of musical tones.Why give such prominence to the “male” numbers? And what other numbers do theygenerate. Again, the answer is cosmological in nature:> The male odd numbers take precedence over their female octave “doubles” not> only because they lie closed to god = 1, but presumably because they permit> the divine unity to be subdivided rigorously according to the principle of> unity; if we limit generative ratios, as Greek musical theory did> traditionally, to those between two consecutive intergers… then each odd> number (oddness itself being due to an element of unity) functions as the> arithmetic mean for an earlier superparticular ratio, and subdivides it> according to the same principle. We can schematize this subdivision as> follows: image [images/00071.jpg]Note carefully the implications of this musical-topological metaphor, forclearly, it is not impaled on the horns of the either-or dialectic of having tochoose between “pure monotheism” — a “feminine” principle in terms of theancient worldview — nor a “pure polytheism”, or “masculine” principle in termsof the ancient worldview. The metaphor is an acid drip on that conventionalopposition, for what one is looking at is an “androgynous both-and,” oneencompassing both unity and diversity, and attempting to relate the two in acarefully conceived topological and musical metaphor. The musical metaphor of the circles also lies behind the “churning of the MilkySea”, for the diversity of the universe, as we saw at Angkor Wat, arises fromthe tension created by Vishnu’s original “tripartation” or differentiation.Rotation, understood in musical terms, in the terms of frequencies, is thekey.29 It goes without saying that spin and rotation moment are crucial conceptsin distinguishing sub-atomic particles; thus as we shall see in chapter 13,there may be even deeper meanings to these ancient metaphors. There is even adimension of Vedic teaching which relates all this cosmological topology andmusic to consciousness itself, for Soma, the magical food and drink of the godsthat confers expanded consciousness, does so first of all by bringing insightinto the musical experience as being comprised of the theory of numbers.30From the musical point of view, however, the Vedic philosophy never completelyreconciled the two cycles arising from unity, namely, the cycle of thirds, andthe cycle of fifths. To put it differently, it never completely integrated the“female” octave with the “male” notes within that octave, and thus, any numberof types of scales could be generated, all of which were, from the Vediccosmological standpoint, equally valid.31 The task of effecting that union andtaking the first steps to our modern system of “equal tempering” or tuning wastaken in Mesopotamia, and with its sexagesimal system of arithmetic.D. The Sexagesimal System, Music, and Cosmology It was in fact the famous Sumerologist Samuel Noah Kramer who located the fabledSumerian “land of the gods,” Dilmun, with the “Harappan culture of pre-VedicIndia.”32 By the time of the high Mesopotamian cultures, however, Vedicmathematical prowess had grown to enormous sophistication.> It is startling to learn…that the art of calculation in the third millenium> (sic) Babylon — before the time of Abraham — was already comparable in many> aspects with the mathematics “of the early Renaissance,” thirty-odd centuries> later. Computation was made easy by the possession of tables (of which we have> many copies) of “reciprocals, multiplications, squares and square roots,> cubes, and cube roots, the sums of squares and cubes… exponential functions,> coefficients giving numbers for practical computation… and numerous> metrological calculations giving areas of rectangles, circles,” etc. The> Pythagoran theorem was known in Babylon “more than a thousand years before> Pythagoras.” The foundations were laid for the discovery of the irrationality> of √2 “exactly in the same arithmetical form in which it was obviously> re-discovered so much later by the Greeks.” Traditional stories of discoveries> made by Thales or Pythagoras must be discarded as “totally unhistorical”; much> of what we have thought was Pythagorean must now be credited to Babylon.33 The implications, for McClain, are enormous, for this means that> The Hebrew Bible is thus the product of a Semitic culture which had mastered> the fundamentals of music and mathematics a thousand years and more before its> oldest pages were written. The stage was set for mathematical allegory on a> grander scale than the relatively late Christian civilization has ever> realized.34 Indeed, as will be seen, the Hebrew version of this mathematical and musicalmetaphor constitutes a step of trying to edit and invert the inheritedMesopotamian musical and mathematical metaphors of the “god of the mountain.”In this musical mathematical allegory, McClain notes that its sexagesimal systemof whole number integers was “probably the most convenient language foracoustical arithmetic the world ever knew” until the rise of logarithmiccomputation introduced in the nineteenth century of our era.35 Here we must alsopause to note something that was observed in the previous book in this series,Genes, Giants, Monsters, and Men, namely, that the ancient systems of measures,and in particular, the Sumerian sexagesimal system, were also based onastronomical and geodetic measures,36 in other words, one is not only looking ata musical system of numbering, but on a cosmological and geodetic one. Quiteliterally, the three cannot be disentangled; one is literally looking at themusic of the planets, the music of the medium itself. The musical advantage isthat it allows one to retain the uses of the “female” even numbers generatingthe octave matrix and the male numbers, based on powers and multiples of 3 and5, generating the rest of the twelve tones, as in the ratio 30:60, a ratio thatis based on multiples of 2, 5 and 6. Note also that the ratio can be reduced to3:6, which can be reduced to the female number of 2; and that 60:5 is, ofcourse, 12, giving the 12 tones of the chromatic scale, and, for theMesopotamians, the 12 houses of the Zodiac. Succinctly stated, it is in thesexagesimal system that cosmology, music, number theory, and physics all meet ina harmonious whole.37But what of the “gods” themselves, and our formula “Mountains ≈ Planets ≈ Gods ≈Pyramids ≈ Music?” Why did the gods become associated with mountains and music?It so happens that within Mesopotamia numerological mythology, that the threeprinciple gods, Ea-Enki, Enlil, and Anu, are all numerically, and therefore,musically related, Ea-Enki having the value of 40, Enlil the value of 50, andAnu the value of 60, which, in the sexagesimal system, is also representative ofthe primordial unity, or 1. In musical terms, if one assigns a fundamental tone— say in this case, the note D — to An, then Enlil represents a third up or downfrom that (f or b), and Ea-Enki a fourth down or up (A or G), and from Enki,then, the entire circle of fourths and therefore all twelve tones, would begenerated.38 Note that the ratio of these three gods is 40:50:60, or 4:5:6. Fromthem, the whole modern twelve-note chromatic “tonal universe” is generated, asin our circle of fourths example above.39If all this seems dense and obscure, it’s about to become even more so, for inthe ultimate example of the “unified intention of symbol,” the numerical-musicalallegory is reproduced in Berossus’ version of the Kings’ List of kings beforethe Flood: image [images/00072.jpg]Note that the total, when divided by the quintessential Mesopotamian sexagesimalnumber of 3600, is 120, a harmonic of 12, our twelve chromatic tones once again.In order to understand how all this relates to our musical tone circles, we haveto look closer at Ea-Enki, whose numerological value is 40. To understand howthis is so, it is important to remember that every whole number, when viewedmusically, is viewed in some ratio to the number sixty, but the Mesopotamians donot actually write that second number. Thus, Enki’s number, 40, is really theratio 40:60, or 2:3, an essential musical relationship in generating the twelvetones, for as such, he is the “first born son” of Anu, that is, “the first odd,hence male integer.”41 As god of the “sweetwaters,” Enki is also “the Sumeriancounterpart to the Greek Poseidon” and thus intricately related to the myth ofAtlantis.42E. Music and Higher-Dimensional Geometries:The Musical Gods of the Musical Mountains Enki, with 2:3 as his numbers, thus is a metaphor for the powers and multiplesof 3 and 5, and here we come to the crux of the matter, for when these powersare graphed, a “numerical mountain” results, which we have followed by showingMcClain’s graph of the “irreducible” integers and the tonal “zigurrats,” asMcClain calls them, or mountains that result.image [images/00073.jpg] McClain’s “Tonal Zigurrats”43 Similarly, Enlil, whose number is 50, that is to say, 50:60 in the Mesopotamianscheme of ratios, and Marduk, laying at 25, both generated their own numericaltonal mountains.image [images/00074.jpg] McClain’s Babylonian Gods of the Mountain44 Note the “Pickax” form of tones and their reciprocals (represented by the dotted“upside down ’mountain’”), for if one does a rotation of that mountain on itsside so that the numbers on Marduk?s Mountain, which represent the tonesgenerated in the pickax, can a common shared generating point in the number one,we get this:image [images/00075.jpg] McClain’s Diagram of Twin-Peaked Mt. Mashu45 Note that on the horizontal line extending in each direction we have the initialunity, its first “tripartation” represented by 3 and 5 on the horizontal anddiagonal, and on the horizontal, powers of three extending into infinity, and onthe diagonal, powers of 5 extending into infinity, and between them, multiplesof 3 and 5.If we overlay the extended version of these tonal mountains over each other, weobtain an analogue of a familiar, and very Babylonian, figure, the “Star ofDavid:”image [images/00076.jpg] Musical Brahmins and Babylonian “Star of David”46 The significance of all this is that music and its mathematical codes, inMcClain’s view, played an inevitable role in the emergence of monotheism:> Monotheism took as its God not the Great God 60(actually written in> Babylonian-Sumerian as a large ONE), but the irreducible unity itself, that> is, the unity whose multiplicity creates all the diversity of number, that> unity which alone can subdivide prime numbers, the active agents of all> creation.47 And of these, as we see from the previous page, the numbers 3 and 5 are thefirst two and most important prime numbers in the musical metaphor.In other words, the ancient mathematicians performed what geometers would call arotation, revealing a connection to another metaphorical mountain, the sacredtectratys of Pythagoreanism:image [images/00077.jpg] McClain’s Musical Evolution of Monotheism48 We will reserve comment on all the esoteric and physical principles embodied inthe Pythagorean tectratys for chapter twelve. For now, it should be noted that,like the musical circle of tones itself, we have returned to thatmusical-topological metaphor that began the process we discovered at Angkor Wat,but now the metaphor has taken on an added richness, for specific numerical andmusical functions have now been ascribed to the original primary “tripartition”or differentiation.1. Babylonian and Hebrew Flood Chronologies There is another backdrop against which the ancient physics of the grid must beviewed, and that is the Platonic allegory of Atlantis and of the Flood itself,an account that McClain, with much humor and accuracy, says is a “kind ofPythagorean Grand Opera, complete with an all-star cast, a water show, dazzlingscenery, and a tragic finale.”49 Yet, even here one finds that there are codeswithin the texts.For example, there are hidden correspondences between the Hebrew and Babylonianchronologies of the Flood, correspondences that point to deeper numerical codes.McClain observes that the famous scholar of comparative mythologies, JosephCampbell,> … discovered a correlation between the 432,000 years from the creation to the> flood in Babylonian mythology and the 1,656 years from the creation of Adam to> the flood in the Hebrew account. Campbell points out that these numbers have a> common factor of 72, and that 1656/72 is 23. Now 23 Jewish years of 365 days> plus five extra days for leap years equals 8,400 days or 1,200 seven-day> weeks; multiplying by 72 to find the number of Jewish seven-day weeks in 1,656> (= 23 x 72) years yields 86,400 (1200 x 72). But the number 86,400 is> 432,000/5, i.e., the number of Babylonian five- day weeks to the flood. Thus> there is no necessary contradiction whatever in these different flood> chronologies.50 To put it differently, it is possible that the standard views of conservativebiblical scholars as to the relative recentness of the Deluge are thrown into acocked hat, and that the actual meaning of the biblical numerical codes is thatthe Deluge occurred much farther back in time, in a context or chronologicalframework commensurate with its antiquity in Mesopotamian myths.2. Babylonian Mathematics: Clues to a Higher-Dimensional Physics? In this context, a closer look at the sexagesimal system of ancient Sumer andBabylon are in order, for as has been seen, various numbers are ascribed tovarious gods in the pantheon. But there is another clue in Mesopotamian numbers,a clue that, oddly, resembles the modern numerical notations forhigher-dimensional geometric objects: “In the sexagesimal system, 450,000 wouldbe written as 2,5, meaning 2 x 603 + (5 x 602), perhaps a pun on Marduk = 25.”51Note that in this system of notation, each number in {2,5} stands for thatnumber in connection with some function that is a power of 60. One can, notesMcClain, have a series of such numbers, such as {8,0,0} and so on.52It is important to note what this notation means, for cubing and squaring anumber — e.g. x3 and x2 — are, of course, geometrical functions describingobjects in two or three spatial dimensions. Thus, the notation {2,5} mentionedabove could be written this way more abstractly as {x, y}, and since the firstnumber is multiplied by the cubic power of 60, and the second by the squaredpower of 60, the notation really would look like this:image [images/00078.jpg] We can therefore imagine extending this notation to {x,y,z}, and extending thepowers of 60 with which each number is multiplied, e.g. {(x ⋅ 604) + (y ⋅ 603) +(z ⋅ 602)}; in other words, notations such as {8,0,0}, which are also within therealm of possibility in ancient Mesopotamian notation, conceivably may beunderstood as representing powers of 60 greater than the cubic, that is to say,as geometric and numerical representations of objects in four or moredimensions.To state it as succinctly as possible, the very structure of ancientMesopotamian numerical notation implies a basic familiarity withhyper-dimensional geometries and the basic mathematical techniques fordescribing objects in four or more spatial dimensions. Indeed, as we shalldiscover in chapter 13, the exact same notation convention began to be used innineteenth century geometrical techniques for describing objects in four or moredimensions!53This contains a further, and very suggestive, implication, for it is to be notedthat the Sumerian-Babylonian gods may be described by such notation. In otherwords, the gods were being described peculiar union of physics and religion, ashyper-dimensional entities or objects.54 This new twist upon the “unifiedintention of symbol” we will encounter again in the next part of this book inconjunction with the Egyptian interpretation of this paleophysics of thephysical medium, and its conjunction with religious cosmology. It is, however, aheritage that we have discovered is common to ancient Vedic India as well asMesopotamia, and we have encountered suggestive parallels between Mesopotamianmyths and those of Meso-America. It was, to paraphrase McClain, in India,Mesopotamia, Egypt and even Meso- America, that one is able “to watch the birthof the gods in the minds of musical poets and discover that continuity oftradition which maintains a perfect unity between music, mathematics, andmetaphysics.”55 With Plato, the final step was taken, as the physics of thecelestial harmonies and the gods was transformed into a technique of socialengineering and political theory.56 The ancient classical world had, in otherwords, moved quickly to outline all the implications of thismusico-physical-metaphysical legacy that it had inherited, even though it maynot have fully understood those implications, nor raised the technology to matchin deed what its mythologies recorded.3. Mesopotamian Music and the Fine Structure Constant But does all this musical numerology actually contain any clue that the ancientswere passing on a legacy that contained within it the seeds of a lost knowledgeof a much deeper physics?There is indeed one such clue, and it’s a whopper.The Greeks, as noted above, inherited this musical-metaphysical legacy fromPlato, who in turn gained it from the Pythagoreans and Mesopotamia. One may alsopoint out that Plato was clear — in his “Atlantean dialogues,” the Timeus andCritias — that there was also an Egyptian influence at work. All this was inturn encoded by Plato in many dialogues as a political theory, as a means ofsocial engineering. Various “cities” are worked out — including Atlantis andAthens — along different numerical lines. In these attempts to divine themusical proportions of the “best” city, Plato proposes the city Callipolis, his> ‘absolutely best’ city — his ‘celestial city,’ the diatonic scale sung by the> Sirens in his planetary model — seven numbers required for the diatonic scale> produce all eleven tones. image [images/00079.jpg] McClain observes that within this octave-numerical scheme, that the largest“genetic element is 36, or 729.58That number — 729 — may be one of the most significant in all of physics, for itis the decimal coefficient of the Fine Structure Constant, typically given afractional value of 1/137 and usually denoted, coincidentally, and perhapsironically enough, by the Greek letter alpha, α, for when one carries out thefunction of dividing 1 by 137, the result is .00729927007, an approximateharmonic of 729.59Of course, the presence of only one occurrence of this coefficient does not meanthat the Greeks — or for that matter those from whom they inherited theirknowledge — were aware of this significance of this number. But as we shalldiscover in the next section on Egypt, there is strong and suggestive evidencethat whatever Very High Civilization as preceded those cultures of the classicera(i.e., the Vedic, Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Greek civilizations), thatcivilization did know of the existence of these and other constants of modernphysical mechanics, millennia before their (re-)discovery in our own era.Why would the preservation of the numerical value of the fine structureconstant, particularly in a musical-political context, be so significant? Theanswer lies in the deeply mysterious nature of the constant itself. Firstdiscovered in 1916 by physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, the constant is essentially adimensionless constant — effectively, a scalar in mathematical terms, or a “puremagnitude” — possessing the same value in all systems or units of measure, andmeasuring the strength of electromagnetic coupling. But the problem is, whilethe constant “fits” the rest of physics like a glove, its own origins are sounique and inscrutable that it has puzzled physicists ever since. No less aphysicist than Feynmann felt compelled to comment on its almost mystical natureand attraction for physicists ever since its first discovery:> It has been a mystery since it was discovered more than fifty years ago, and> all good theoretical physicists put this number60 up on their wall and worry> about it. Immediately you would like to know where this number for a coupling> comes from; is it related to π or perhaps to the base of natural logarithms?> Nobody knows. It’s one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics: a magic> number that comes to us with no understanding by man. You might say the “hand> of God” wrote that number, and “we don’t know how He pushed his pencil.” We> know what kind of a dance to do experimentally to measure this number very> accurately, but we don’t know what kind of dance to do with the computer to> make this number come out, without putting it in secretly!61 In other words, unlike most of the constants of physics, mathematics, andgeometry, the Fine Structure Constant’s relationship to geometrical functionswas obscure. It explained a lot, but its own basis remained obscure, unless oneremembers the musical context in which it occurs in Plato.The presence of this decimal basis of the coefficient of a constant of physicsonly discovered in the early twentieth century in writings that antedate it byover two thousand years suggests that its presence in those writings might be alegacy from High Antiquity, and a very sophisticated civilization.One lone coefficient squatting otherwise anachronistically in an ancient textdoes not, however, constitute a case. If one were to encounter similarcoefficients of quantum mechanics in decidedly ancient contexts, the case wouldbecome more solid, and the indicators that at least some of the structures ofthe world grid constituted parts or “gears” in a vast global hyper-dimensionalmachine, would become stronger.Not surprisingly, one can find precisely such things at the center of themachine, at Giza, and in even older structures buried and only recentlyrediscovered in the deserts of Egypt.

Discovered in 1973 by FredWendorf and his archaeological team, the site was soon excavated,2 and with it,an almost inconceivable mystery was unearthed, for according to the astronomerThomas G. Brophy, who undertook the most extensive examination of thestructure’s encoded physics, “a people living over seven thousand years ago mayhave possessed technical knowledge in astronomy and physics more advanced thanour current understandings of the same subjects.”3As of this juncture, though it is difficult to say whether or not this site lieson a significant “grid” point, the site nonetheless commands our attentionprecisely because of the knowledge it demonstrates concerning advanced physicsand astronomical knowledge it displays. There are, according to Brophy, at leastthree levels of sophistication involved in this ancient megalithic structure,the last two of which comprise the most serious difficulties for the standardacademic models of history: > 1) Maps and markers denoting objects, alignments, and events that can be> observed in the sky with the unaided (naked) eye.> 2) Markers indicating celestial phenomena and events that cannot be observed> (apparently) with the unaided eye.> 3) Detailed astronomical and cosmological information, such as distances to> stars, speeds at which stars are moving away from us, the structure of our> galaxy (The Milky Way), and information on the origin of the universe, which> we have either only just discovered in modern times, or possibly information> (for example, concerning planetary systems around stars) that we do not even> have available to us at the moment.4Even worse for the standard academic models of history, all of this ispositioned within a site whose astronomical alignments last occurred ca. 16,500BC!5This is a significant point, for it corroborates ancient Egypt’s own legends andhistorical records — Manetho among them — that its civilization is of muchgreater antiquity than standard academic historiography will allow, and it alsocorroborates the ancient Egyptians’ view that theirs was a legacy civilization.But this is not the only problem posed by the Nabta Playa megaliths, for theyare intimately tied to that most famous site associated with Egypt: Giza, forboth Nabta Playa, and Giza, have alignments pointing to the Galactic center, andin Giza’s case, this alignment to the Galactic center occurred in 10,909 BC.6 InNabta Playa’s case, argues Brophy, we are looking at a literal, and verysophisticated, “cosmology in stone.”7A. Celestial Alignments at Nabta Playa One need only look at the celestial alignments Brophy detected at Nabta Playa tosee how intricate and complex the megaliths there really are.In its basic form, the Nabta Playa site is a circle of stone slabs — a“calendar” circle — similar to many other such sites in Europe and SouthAmerica, and is of obvious antiquity. This “calendar circle”> consists of an outer rim of sandstone slabs with four sets of larger gate> stones that form two (lines) of sight “windows” in the calendar circle. Inside> the circle are six larger stones. The largest of the slabs are almost three> feet long, and the smallest are slight less than a foot. The circle is ten to> eleven feet across.8 However, in addition to this, it was eventually discovered that the sitepossesses two further subterranean levels buried beneath the earth,9 thus makingthe entire site a complex three-dimensional object that, as will be shown,exhibits an extraordinary degree of knowledge and deliberation in the way it wasconstructed.1. The Celestial Alignments The complex sophistication of the knowledge and deliberation that went into theconstruction of Nabta Playa is evident in the first level of the site, thesurface “circle” itself, for there are a host of astronomical alignments andother celestial features encoded in the structure. The first, and most obvious,of these alignments also immediately confronts one with an anomaly:> Three of those central six stones are a diagram of the constellation of> Orion’s Belt as it appeared on the meridian around summer solstice from 6,400> BC to 4,900 BC. The “meridian” is simply the line in the sky that passes north> to south, and is thus the midway line or “meridian” across which stars pass in> their nightly travels from rising in the east to setting in the west. Thus the> inside of the calendar circle had a clear use as a star-viewing diagram.10 Therein lies the anomaly, and it is a somewhat anachronistic one, for as mostpeople are aware, the Egyptian religion was fixated upon the constellation Orionand evolved a complex mythology of death and resurrection fastened around thegods Osiris, Set, Isis, and Horus. The constellation became, for them, averitable seal of the concept of Osiris’ resurrection. The six megaliths in thecenter of the Nabta Playa circle were, when compared with reliable modernastronomical star charts, clearly meant to represent the six stars of Orion:Alnitak, Alnilam, Mintaka, Betelgeuse, Bellatrix, and Meissa.11So what is a structure doing in the Egyptian desert that antedates the oldestEgyptian structures, and the Egyptian religion, itself? Or to put itdifferently: why the fixation on Orion?To make the chronological anachronism and anomaly very much worse, Brophy soondiscovered that there were earlier alignments encoded within the calendarcircle. Three of the stones, as was noted, pointed to alignments ca. 4,900 to6,400 BC. But there was a problem with the other three:> The apparent significance of the other three central stones in the calendar> circle is more difficult to reconcile with prevalent assumptions about> prehistory. These other three stones are a diagram of the configuration of> Orion’s head and shoulders as they appeared on the meridian on summer solstice> sunset in the centuries around 16,500 BC. That date is symmetrically opposite> the 5,000 BC congruence of the Orion’s Belt stars, in terms of the precession> of the equinoxes, and both dates are at the extremes (maximum and minimum) of> the tilt angle of the Orion constellation. Thus the stone diagram illustrates> the time, location, and tilting behavior of the constellation of Orion through> the 25,900 year equinox precession cycle, and how to understand the pattern> visually.12 Lest one be tempted to use this earlier alignment as a means to date thestructure, Nabta Playa has surprises in store, for it is a clear example of ayounger site clearly encoding alignments that antedate its construction byseveral thousands of years:> The case for the southern three stones in the diagram is also strong, but it> is troubling to some investigators because there is no evidence yet of> activity circa 16,000 BC at Nabta Playa, and the calendar circle couldn’t be> that old because it sets on younger sediments, and there is bias against the> idea that ancient people could have known that the constellations change tilt> long term due to the precession of the equinoxes.13 In other words, someone in pre-dynastic times in Egypt had accurate knowledge ofthe precession of the equinoxes and had encoded the entire cycle within thecalendar circle.image [images/00080.jpg] Brophy’s Chart of the 16,500BC Summer Solsticial Alignment14 None of this, however, was beyond the ability of primitive peoples either toobserve or to enshrine in structures with their primitive technology:> …(It) should not be assumed that ancient sky watchers could not determine> geometrical heliacal risings, even without the use of technology or> mathematics, if they wanted to. An astute observer would simply watch the> rising of the star for several days during the year while the star’s rise was> clearly visible. If the ancient sky watcher knew when vernal equinox was, he> would simply extrapolate the star rise time of day to vernal equinox and> determine if it would be a geometrical heliacal rising. That is a very> achievable feat for an accomplished ancient megalithic astronomer even without> technology or mathematics. > Thus so far in this analysis of the Nabta megalithic astronomy these> alignments could possibly have been designed by ancient peoples with the> usually assumed low level of Stone Age technology. The designers displayed> astonishing elegance and clarity, but plausibly they could have done it with> primitive technology.15 But this easy explanation collapsed when Brophy then turned to deeper and closeranalyses of the calendar circle.One of the first clues that suggested to him that he was dealing with astructure requiring far more knowledge and sophistication than merely Stone Agetechnology was when he compared the analogues of distances between the stones inthe circle that represented stars, and their modern astronomical measures,incorporating standard errors. The result? The measures of the Nabta Playacircle, when compared with modern astronomical measures, were astonishinglyaccurate.> This is the first very important result of this analysis of the Nabta Playa> megalith map. Star distances are difficult to measure. Modern science’s best> estimates of star distances, based on astrophysical models of star evolution,> were very erroneous until recently. Only with the launcing of the Hipparcos> satellite observatory, above the atmosphere, have we been able to directly> measure parallaxes (parallaxes are the different angles measured to a star as> the Earth travels around the Sun) and achieve somewhat accurate star> distances. If these star distances are the intended meaning of the Nabta Playa> map, and are not coincidence, then much of what we think we know about> prehistoric human civilizations must be revised. Further study of the Nabta> Playa megalith map proves that this is in fact not coincidence.16 Behind Brophy’s carefully chosen words is the extraordinary implication thatsuch distances could not have been observed nor computed accurately by the nakedeye or by means of Stone Age technology. By the nature of the case, theyrequired sophisticated technologies and mathematical techniques.Just how sophisticated was revealed to Brophy when, extending his analysis notonly to star distance but to radial velocities, a new level of complexity wasrevealed (and remember, we are still only dealing with the surface structure; wehave yet to encounter the truly astonishing things buried at Nabta Playa!).Observing that the placement of the megaliths in the northern half of the circle“indicate velocities” of stars receding from the Earth,17 Brophy then makes aseries of observations, each of which is massively disturbing to theconventional academic views of prehistory:> In the Nabta megalith map so far, one megalith in each southern alignment> represents the physical distance to that star, and one megalith in each> corresponding northern alignment represents the radial velocity of that star.> Also, each corresponding northern and southern pair of megalith alignments> contain the same respective numbers of megaliths. > … > If we continue to look at the site as an astrophysical map, and note that> each alignment has one primary stone representing the primary star plus> secondary stones, the obvious question to consider is whether the other> megaliths in each line may represent planets or secondary “companion” stars to> the primary star. > This hypothesis cannot yet be tested against observations because modern> astronomers are not yet able to observe the planetary and companion systems of> these stars. Extrasolar planet detection techniques are proceeding rapidly> apace though and some day soon we may be able to observe these systems.18 > However, we can test the physics of this hypothesis. If the hypothesis> does apply to the stones, then the megaliths must be placed according to the> astrophysical laws of planetary motion.19 In other words, Brophy proposed to “reverse engineer” the site according to theprinciples of standard celestial mechanics, in order “to test what astrophysicalprinciples might have been used” to construct the site.20When this was done, the physics of orbital dynamics were not only entirelyconsistent “with the dynamics or orbital motion,” but the accuracy was betterthan many modern experiments. Brophy records his own astonishment at thisresult:> Readers who have worked with actual scientific or engineering data will> appreciate that I was nearly floored when I saw (the data) plot. Remember> these megalith location markers are actual data from the site, constructed> seven thousand years ago or longer, and they fit the physical theory better> than many good modern experiments fit their theory the first time.21 In other words, one was not dealing merely with megalithic technology ortechniques; whoever built the site was relying at some point and to some degreeon a sophisticated knowledge of physics, knowledge that could only have predatedthe site’s builders, and been handed down to them.image [images/00081.jpg] Brophy’s Chart of the 16,500 BC and 4,940 BC Alignments22 2. The Subterranean Structures and the Cosmological Meaning We have already observed that the Nabta Playa site is a three dimensionalstructure, having subterranean layers or levels. These archaeology could notinterpret along the lines of its usual, worn-out “tombs and religion” paradigm,and after digging around them hoping to find “bones and grave goods” but failingto do so, simply dubbed these subterranean megaliths as “complex structures.”23These are more accurately “sculptures carved onto the bedrock 8 to 12 feetbeneath the surface.”24One of these, dubbed by archaeologists Complex Structure A, contains a surfacecarving of an analogue of the entire Milky Way Galaxy.25 That’s not all:> The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy, a recently discovered small satellite galaxy to> our Milky Way may even be represented in the correct place on the sculpture as> are the galactic spiral arms. In fact recent astrophysical analysis of the> shape and location of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy indicates that it more> closely fits the Nabta sculpture representation than the Electronic Sky> drawing… in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.26 Again, one must understand that this means no merely megalithic culture couldhave sculpted such a diagram without having access to refined and sophisticatedscientific knowledge, knowledge that required for its very basis access totechnologies commensurate with those possessed today.Before proceeding further, a look at Brophy’s sketches of Complex Structure A isin order.image [images/00082.jpg] Brophy’s Diagram of the Subterranean Complex Structure A, Looking West27 image [images/00083.jpg] Brophy’s Diagram of the Subterranean Complex Structure A, LookingNorth; the “Cosmological Lens” is Clearly in Evidence28 As is apparent from this diagram, with which we shall be concerned throughoutthe remainder of this chapter, Complex Structure A is, indeed, “complex,” for itexists in three distinctive layers. When the bottom layer — the Milky Waysculpture itself — is considered, the result, again, is even more damaging tothe idea that this site is the product of a primitive Megalithic culture:> Astonishing as it may be, the bedrock sculpture underneath “Complex Structure> A” at Nabta PLaya appears to be an accurate depiction of our Milky Way Galaxy,> as it was oriented astronomically at a specific time: vernal equinox heliacal> rising of the Galactic Center in 17,700 BC.29 Whoever built this structure, in other words, knew not only about the onlyrecently discovered satellite dwarf galaxy to the Milky Way, but had accurateenough astronomical knowledge of the Milky Way’s galactic center.Brophy, however, was by no means finished with his list of amazing discoveriesin the structure, and it is here that we start to approach the most paradoxicaland anachronistic part of the Nabta Playa mystery. As he investigated theComplex Structures, Brophy discovered something else: that in addition to thelevels and layers within the physical structures, there were also more than onelayer or level of scales employed in the analogies between the structure and thecelestial space it was encoding. There were, in fact, three scaling laws:> 17.0 AU(astronomical units)/m (meter) for planets and companion stars; 0.799> LY (light years)/m for stars; and 17,600 LY/m for galaxies. The designers of> the map needed to employ different scales to fit the different types of> objects together on the map. Each type of object (planet, star, galaxy) is> placed on the map according to the scale for that type. Different scales for> different types of objects are called “scaling laws.” Continuing with our> astrophysical reverse engineering, to search for more information in the map> at other scales, it is logical to look for a pattern in the scaling laws. If> there is such a pattern, one might expect it to be a natural, nondimensional> pattern. (Nondimensional meaning not depending on the use of an artificial> measure like meters or feet.) > Nondimensionalizing the three scales (by expressing each in terms of> meters on the ground to meters in the sky, thus eliminating the ‘meters”) and> then taking the natural logarithm, yields a sequence of whole numbers: (29,> 37, 47). These are prime numbers. And the numbers appear to fit a pattern> given by selecting the next largest prime number in a log-linear sequence. In> such a sequence, the next scale in the map is given by 59. > This next scaling law gives a new scale of one meter on the ground at> Nabta equals 2.87 billion light-years in the sky.30 To put it differently, the complexity of the structures and the scaling lawsinvolved mean, once again, that whoever constructed the site, they were doing soon the basis of knowledge and techniques handed down to them, for the ability toobserve some of the objects depicted in the Nabta Playa map implied a technologysophisticated enough to do so.We are looking, in other words, at a site constructed by the legacy of a VeryHigh Civilization in High Antiquity, and therefore, once again, we are lookingat a site whose very construction was probably done at the instigation of somesurviving elite of that civilization.This brings us to the megalith within the Complex Structure that can only becalled “the cosmological sculpture” and the extraordinary astronomical andastrophysical information encoded within it, information that once again clearlypoints to a degree of physics sophistication commensurate with that of our owncontemporary era.Noting first that conventional archaeology persists in applying meaninglesscategories to the structure with little regard to its encoded mathematics, andspeculating that it is “a ritual depiction of a cow,”31 Brophy notes the oddmathematical correspondences, and it is worth citing them at length:> The distance from the Sun to the outer spherical edge of the sculpture,> according to the scaling law, is about 6 billion light-years. This is highly> suggestive that the sculpted stone is a representation of the cosmological> “Big Bang” of creation. Possibly it represents the age of the universe at the> time of the origin of our solar system (which is roughly 5 billion years old).> Or possibly the designers of the map meant for the diameter of curvature of> the sculpture, rather than its radius of curvature, to represent the current> age of the universe — 12 billion years. Or a third possibility is that it> represents a current universe age of 6 billion years which would mean that our> astrophysical models are in error by a factor of about 2. > … > More corroboration of the cosmological significance of this sculpture is> found in its shape, size, and orientation. Except for the angular protrusion> on one corner, the four curved, angled cornered sides of the stone may match a> shape defined by two lines of declination on the sides, and on the top and> bottom by two lines of right ascension. This is shown (on the diagrams on p.> 267 of the current book) which is a drawing of such a declination window for> the Galactic Center as viewed from Nabta Playa looking roughly east and up.> Thus the shape of the sculpture, as it was placed facing outward from the sun> location on the Milky Way Galaxy Sculpture, forms a “declination window” for> the Galactic Center. The sculpture appears to have been carefully oriented> such that this declination window subtends the full range of motion of the> declinations of the Galactic Center.32 But the Nabta Playa “Complex Structures” held one final surprise, and it was themost breathtaking one of all.B. The Biggest Problem for the Standard Model:The Analogues of the Constants of Quantum Mechanics at Nabta Playa Dr. Brophy discovered, in addition to all the other encoded mathematics, codesthat actually embodied within the Complex Structure the actual coefficients ofthe constants of quantum mechanics, millennia before their (re-) discovery inthe early 20th century! It is best to allow Dr. Brophy to describe the processonce again in his own words:> Finally, if we apply the scaling law sequence once more, the inverse natural> log of the prime number 79 would give a scale that could only represent> objects much larger than the known universe. However, if we now reverse the> scale from macro to microcosm, the scaling law sequence yields a scale that> could represent extremely small things: 0.505 meters at Nabta equals one Plank> Length. > The Planck Length is considered the fundamental length in physics. It is a> fundamental constant of nature, and is the natural length that derives from> three other fundamental constants of nature: Planck’s constant, the Universal> Gravitation constant, and the speed of light. At an almost unimaginably tiny> 1.6 x 10–35 meters, the Planck Length is the size smaller than which all known> physics breaks down. At this scale, the Cow Sculpture (Cosmological Sculpture)> is close to one Planck Length thick. So the Cosmological Sculpture may double> as a Planck Scale Sculpture.33 Note carefully what is actually being said here: the Cosmological Sculpture is amonument not only of the physics of the very large, but also of the physics ofthe very small, and this suggests that whoever constructed the site held orpossessed the holy grail of modern physics, a physics that was unified and ableto explain macro-and micro-physical mechanics all from the same set ofconceptions and equations.What is present at Nabta Playa, in other words, is strongly suggestive of anengineered physics construction suggesting an engineered, rather than atheoretical, physics unification, an idea I first broached in my Giza DeathStar.34 There I observed a similar phenomenon as Dr. Brophy: the Great Pyramidappeared to encode the numerical coefficients of various constants of quantummechanics in dimensional measures also encoding large scale physics analogues.All this led Dr. Brophy to the most sensational discovery of them all: theComplex Structure was, in fact, an analogue of a hyper-dimensional physics:> … (The) angular protrusion on the Cosmological Sculpture is defined by two> planes that are in a sense orthogonal35 to all of space-time. In the galactic> portion of the map, when an orthogonal plane was introduced it represented an> entirely new coordinate system. Similarly the angular shape and/or size of the> orthogonal plane protrusion on the Cosmological Sculpture may represent> information about physical dimensions orthogonal to space-time. Specifically> it would be a natural way to represent aspects of multidimensional Planck> scale physics such as how many physically meaningful hyperdimensions there> are, eleven perhaps.36 In other words, the engineers of Nabta Playa were constructing an analogue tohyper-dimensional objects and physics itself. Indeed, this is extraordinarilysignificant, for any attempt to unify the physics of the very large and the verysmall has to be hyper-dimensional in nature.Again, the extraordinary nature of these discoveries cannot be overlooked andmust be stated explicitly for their full significance to sink in: whoever builtNabta Playa in general and the Complex Structure A in particular, by definition,had to be in possession of physics and mathematical techniques at least assophisticated as those that began to emerge in our own times in the 19th and20th centuries. We are most definitely not looking at “ritual cows” and all theother nonsense that conventional archaeology claims for these structures. We arelooking at a legacy structure of something that must of necessity be from HighAntiquity and from an extraordinarily sophisticated scientific culture for StoneAge man most definitely did not possess knowledge of the constants of quantummechanics.C. Summary What we are confronted with at Nabta Playa, when all is said and done, is analchemical architecture in stone, an alchemical lithographical embodiment ofsophisticated and only recently discovered constants — and therefore, principles— of quantum mechanics and astrophysical celestial mechanics. This suggests thatwhoever built this amazing structure so long ago did so not only from the basisof a survival of knowledge, a survival of knowledge that could only have beenthe provenance of an informed elite, but that this knowledge in turn viewed thephysics of the very large and the very small as somehow deeply interconnected ina way that modern physics has yet to decipher. They might, indeed, have been inpossession of the Holy Grail of physics: a unified theory that explained andunified all physical forces.It is an alchemical structure, in short, because of the profound knowledge itembodies of the physical medium and all its manifestations from scales spanningthe macrocosm to the microcosm.To say that it is alchemical, however, is to suggest that the site had somefunctional purpose beyond merely memorializing certain mathematical constantsand relationships. It is to say, rather, that it was designed somehow tomanipulate the very medium it memorializes.Could there have been such a functional purpose to the site? Brophy concludesthat at the minimum the engineers of the Nabta Playa megaliths had the followingthree things:> 1)“…Very advanced knowledge of astronomy, such that we are only able to> achieve with modern high technology;”37> 2)“…a basic understanding of physics, and knowledge of astronomy that rivaled> or surpassed ours today;”38 and,> 3) “…knowledge of the astrophysical galaxy, and our situation in it, similar> to our own such knowledge.”39However, even Dr. Brophy sensed there was something more than merelymemorialization at work in the functional purpose of the site: > …(Notwithstanding) the astrophysical and microphysical importance of the map,> the most intriguing aspect of it may be that it appears to describe some sort> of function. Such a function seems to involve certain alignments among the> supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, the Big Bang, the Sun> (probably at vernal equinox sunrise), Earth’s spin axis, and human beings. A> unified understanding of this map, together with the alignments indicated in> the Giza monuments, and probably with other megalithic structures yet to be> deciphered, may pinpoint this function and indicate how to make use of it.> This function may involve purely physical processes on one end of a spectrum,> or involve human consciousness on the other end of the spectrum. > There are hints in some very ancient writings, such as the Sumerian, that> might be interpreted as describing such a precise astrophysical-human> interaction… (On) its 17,700 BC vernal equinox alignment date the Galactic> Center rose very close with the Sun; thus both bodies entered the “declination> window”, defined by the Cosmological Sculpture, about 40 minutes after> sunrise. Such “galaxy gates”, if they really exist, must entail some mechanism> of interaction between human consciousness and physical reality that is as yet> unknown.40 But we have already seen what the clues are.The Nabta Playa complex encodes a hyper-dimensional physics, one suggesting aunification of the physical mechanics of the very large with the very small. Itthus encodes a physics of dynamic torsion, of rotating systems within cyclicsystems within rotating systems. As most readers of my book Babylon’s Bankstersare also aware, this also encompasses cyclic systems in aggregate humanbehavior.Could there, however, be a more direct link to consciousness, as Brophysuggests? And if so, how does hyper-dimensional geometry and physics fit intothe picture?…Brace yourself… Notes 1 John Anthony West, “Afterword,” in Thomas G.

One thus, bycreating an “orthogonal rotation” through 90 degrees, has created the seconddimension. Repeating the process of creating a perpendicularity to bothdimensions results in the third dimension.

Or Brahma, Siva, and Visnu?…You may, but if you are wise and wish not tobe led astray, you will say: One, Two, which are Three. This has beenrepresented by initiates for those who need images, so that they may rallyaround a tradition, and be bound by what is called ‘religion’.”R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz1 In response to our epigraphs above, we are justified in asking, if the sages“have never taught otherwise” than to make reference to a primordial “trinity”of some sort, then why is that the case? Why do we find trinities not only inChristianity, but more anciently, in the Vedas? In China? In Egypt? And what hasthat to do with the world Grid and physics?These questions may be answered by a consideration of the cosmology — thephysics and mythological context — surrounding the Egyptian pyramids, and may besummed up in one word, ma’at, their word for the materia prima from which allelse derives, and the sacred science they associated with it.The question assumes importance for another reason, namely, that if one is tounderstand fully and completely the unique nature of the Egyptian contributionor component of the world Grid, then one must understand the cosmology that laybehind it. Once again, merely looking at numbers and engineering is not enough.One must look also at the texts and the cultural context.A. The Physical Medium and the Nature of Hieroglyphic Symbols No one performed the task of penetrating deeply into the meaning and spirit ofEgyptian cosmology than the twentieth century’s most accomplishedesotericist-scholar, Rene Schwaller de Lubicz. Schwaller begins where most wouldnot, namely, with the one most obvious fact about Egypt: hieroglyphs:> Each hieroglyph can have an arrested, conventional meaning for common usage,> but it includes (1) all the ideas that can be connected to it, and (2) the> possibility of personal comprehension. This accounts for the cabalistic> character of the hieroglyphs and requires the determinative in the writing.2Just what Schwaller means by “all the ideas that can be connected” to ahieroglyph, he explains a little further on:> Hieroglyphic writing has the advantage over the Hebrew of utilizing images> that, without arbitrary deviations, indicate the qualities and functions> inherent in each sign.Cabalistic writing maintains secrecy but offers a clue by accentuating theprincipal idea, inexpressible by fixed concepts. It always employs a form oftranscription with several possible meanings, using an ordinary fact as a hookto catch the thought: a geographic site, for instance, a historical fact, afunction, a gesture related to a profession, even a well-known theological formor myth.3> That is to say, each hieroglyph represents an “ideological” or “conceptualcomplex” whose principal feature is its analogical, multi-leveled nature.1. Hieroglyphs and the Analogical Nature of the Physical Medium It is crucially important to understand what this means, for in the Egyptiancosmology, a hieroglyph is much more than just a symbol of the physical medium,it is an actual operation and manifestation of it. As will be seen a littlelater in this chapter, the Egyptians held to substantially the same view of thephysical medium as did the ancient Vedic culture of India, and in fact, theEgyptians reproduce the topological metaphor describing that cosmology in almostexactly the same way, as an initial primordial triad that results from a“primary scission” or differentiation. Thus, everything that is a differentiableobject is, on the Egyptian view, derived from the physical medium, and thatincludes, of course, hieroglyphs. But the hieroglyphs are also connected muchmore directly to the physical medium than just by being products of it, by dintof the fact that the medium, as we have noted in previous chapters, isanalogical in nature, that is, that everything produced within it by a processof repeated differentiations still retains some signature of its originalarchetype, especially in terms of any overlapping functions shared between anyof its products. In this sense, a heiroglyph, as Schwaller observed, is meant tobe a collection of specific functions; they are designed as psychotronic objects— if we may use that term — as magical talismans or objects to manipulate notonly the consciousness of their observer, but also of the physical mediumitself. They are, as such, quintessentially magical and alchemical in theirintention and design. There is nothing haphazard about them. The hieroglyphs areanalogical in nature, because in the ancient view, in the topological metaphor,the medium itself is analogical in nature.Schwaller thus views hieroglyphs as functions of the physical medium itself intheir deepest analogical nature:> In order to understand the meanings of a hieroglyph, the qualities and> functions of the represented object must be sought out; if a sign is a> composite, the living meaning of its parts must enter into the synthesis.This presumes an absolute exactitude in the figuration, and excludes anypossibility of malformation or negligence. It should also be observed thatsymmetry is one of the modes of expression, but not to any aesthetic end.4 Because of this close relationship between the hieroglyph and the actual mediumitself, Schwaller points out that the difficulty for moderns in comprehending itarises from its deeply analogical nature; we fail to comprehend the nature of ahieroglyph because “out of laziness, or routine, we skirt this analogic thoughtprocess and designate the object by a word that expresses for us but a singlecongealed concept,”5 rather than the deep and multi-layered complex phenomenonand manifestation of the medium that it is.2. The Hieroglyph, the Unified Intention of Symbol, and the Hidden Elite Egyptian hieroglyphs thus function as a prime example of the deliberate “unifiedintention of symbol,” but in a much more deliberate way than they may at firstseem to do, for given the analogical and multi-layered levels and associationsof meaning in them, any given hieroglyph can, as Schwaller notes, “addressitself simultaneously to all as well as to a chosen few;”6it is, in other words,the writing of an elite, of a group of initiates, who are by dint of that fact,privy to all the hieroglyph’s encoded meanings. It is also the writing of anelite intending to manipulate or socially engineer the wider culture by means ofthe very system of writing it employs, through manipulations of the analogicalthought process that each hieroglyph engenders.B. The Physical Medium and the Role of Sympathetic Magic As such, the hieroglyph not only links directly to the Egyptian view of thephysical medium, but also to its practice of sympathetic magic, an alchemicalprocess that would better be described as “analogical magic.”7 The hieroglyph isthe “concretizing image” of a specific subset of functions or ideas within thatmedium, and hence, as Schwaller puts it once again, “All the qualities andfunctions it contains must therefore be sought out.”8 The reason for this viewof hieroglyphical symbols as analogical symbols, as actual implements inthepractice of analogical magic, follows again from the Egyptians’ nature of thephysical medium itself, for indeed, it was itself a gigantic symbol, a“macro-analogy.”9Function or action is the key here, for the hieroglyph was not understood to besomething static or frozen in time, but an actual activity. In one of his moreabstruse passages, Schwaller has this to say about it:> …(The) analogy is not the symbol, it is the gesture that will be the symbol> evoking the analogy; it summons it forth. This is the directive for the> thousand forms of sympathetic sorcery about which much could be written, but> it is also the key to sacred magic. The latter, however, demands more than a> simple consideration of analogies.In addition to knowledge of the analogues, sacred magic demands mastery of theproper gesture in the consonant ambiance and of the corresponding cosmic moment. He labors in vain who does not take this into account.10 In decoding this crucial passage, it is important to remember that Schwaller wasboth a practicing esotericist, but also a mathematician. Thus, while most peoplewould read this passage as referring to conventional occult magical practices,they ignore the mathematical clues that Schwaller plants in it: by stressing“gesture” and “function,” in addition to a proper timing for the performance of“analogical magic,” Schwaller is pointing, once again, to the “topologicalmetaphor” contained within ancient cosmologies:> To know how to make the proper gesture in the correct milieu at the right> cosmic moment: this is sacred magic. The consequence of this gesture is then> subordinated to neither time nor space: the effects it has caused will be> manifested everywhere and in everything that is harmonically related to the> cause.In this way, often unconsciously, we are magicians. Wisdom consists in knowinghow to become consciously so. … For this the only guides are analogy and signature. This fact hasled to theestablishment of “analogical tables” such as the zodiacand planetaryrelationships with metals and, further, with the various parts of the human bodyand with plant and animal types. This is not a whimsical fantasy or even simplya conclusion based on coincidences observed over long periods of time: theredoes exist a science based on Numbers that reveals the reasons for thesecoincidences.11 Or to put Schwaller’s words into slightly different diction, once again, thereis a direct relationship between consciousness and the physical medium on theancient view, and analogical magic was, as it were, a process designed to honethe consciousness to manipulate it more efficiently. The hieroglyph, that is tosay, the symbol, the physical medium itself, and the performer of the magicalact, exist in a complex system that is open-ended with respect to each of itsthree components.De Lubicz’s final comments about number should be noted carefully, for what heis actually implying is that, behind all the tables of analogicalcorrespondences that one finds in ancient, mediaeval, and modern esotericliterature, there lies a hidden grammar, an actual analogical calculus that,once known, allows one to perceive the deep mathematical relationships ofanalogies clearly, and therefore also allows one to dispense with the tables ofanalogical correspondences themselves. The possession of such a grimoire or“grammar” would make analogical operations formally explicit, and, as Schwalleralso implies, be deeply related to mathematics and to numbers as functions ofthe emergent topology of the medium.This last statement requires further elaboration.The physical medium as the Egyptians understood it was of primary importance toSchwaller, who summarized its philosophical presuppositions and implications ina manner that directly reveals the “topological metaphor” we have previouslyspoken of in context with the Vedic literature of India and the legends ofMeso-America:> 1. Faith in an origin that cannot be situated in time and space. This is> reality absolute, not to be grasped by our intelligence. This cannot be> regarded as a mystery: it is the eternal Present Moment, indivisible Unity. > 2. Through an internal act, the irrational source undergoes a polarization> that manifests itself in spiritual substance. This substance appears as the> energy of which the universe is constituted. Such is the mystery of the> division into two, which, with the irrational origin, comprises the mystic> ternary. > 3. The phenomenon of universe in all its aspects is made up of this energy> substance to the various degrees of its positive (north) polarity going toward> its negative (south) polarity. This becoming is accomplished by alternation, a> positive-negative and negative-positive oscillation. Hence the point of> equilibrium must be the return to the nonpolarized source, the Present Moment,> which cannot be situated.12 Schwaller is here speaking more as a mathematician than as a magician, for theimage that he is invoking is that of the primordial “sameness,” that primordialnothing-everything in which no distitions exist, and which therefore exists in atimeless and spaceless or “placeless place.” By an internal function, thatNothing differentiates itself, and at once there arises what De Lubicz calls the“mystic ternary.” Each broken off or “bracketed” region of an increasingly andrepeatedly differentiated “Nothing” “comprise the phenomena composing ouruniverse.”13 The implication of this analogical view of the medium is furtherrevealed when one adds one more presupposition into the mix, namely, that thephysical medium, in many ancient cosmologies, was consciousness. It is importantthat one understands the vast implications of this, for it means thatconsciousness is not an either-or affair, either one all-encompassing “I” or“Ego,” nor a potentially infinite series of “I’s” or “Egos,” but a both-and: aconsciousness able to endlessly differentiate himself into consciousnesses, eachwith their own unique “I” while remaining part of a greater “I”.14 To put it interms of our topological metaphor once again, the image [images/00024.jpg]>remains in each differentiation, yet each differentiation of it possesses itsown irreducibly unique signature.So how, in Schwaller’s terms, would Number emerge as a function of thismetaphor? We have already seen how with the “bracketing” or “regionalization” ofthe primordial “nothing,” for the creation of a common surface image[images/00084.jpg]> between image [images/00085.jpg]>and image[images/00086.jpg]>means that the common surface has the function of 2, a meanbetween 1, and 3, and so on. Number also emerges thus as a specific topologicalfunction in Schwaller’s understanding of the Egyptian cosmology, for onedesignates the primordial nothing, or first stage, two designates the firstdifferentiation of it, what Schwaller calls the “primary scission,” and threethe end result of the process which ends in three unique versions of the samenothing.Egypt, in other words, was functioning with the exact same topological metaphoras was Vedic India, and Mayan and Aztec Meso-America.A closer look at this “primordial” or “primary” mystic triad or ternary is inorder.C. The Primary Scission and the Primordial Triad1. The Primordial Triad The primordial differentiation, which Scwhaller calls the “primary scission,” isevident in the Memphite myth, which we may understand as yet another“paleophysical metaphor,” i.e., as a profoundly sophisticated physics metaphordisguised in religious terms. There, the primary scission is, as in the Vedictradition, expressed in the generation of the gods from the primordial ocean, orNun:> The revelation of Heliopolis… is the mysterious divine action of the scission> of Unity in Nun (the milieu likened to the primordial Ocean), which coagulates> into the first earth, incarcerating the invisible fire of Tum.This is the heveanly fire fallen into earth, which in the mystery of Memphistakes the name Ptah. This metaphysical fire produces its effects in nature bymaterializing the principles enunciated at Heliopolis, but not as yetmanifested. The appearance of Tum implies the becoming of the three principles and the fouressential qualities philosophically called the constituent elements of matter,but their “corporification” takes place only upon the appearance of the firstTriad: Ptah, Sekhmet, and Nefertum.15 While the emergence of the number four may, at this juncture, seem ad hoc andcompletely arbitrary, we shall see in a little while that it contains yetanother physics metaphor.For the moment, however, our focus must remain on the emergence of theprimordial triad of Ptah, Sekhmet, and Nefertum, for “Immanent in every being isa faculty of numbering that is an a priori knowledge of Number. The very fact ofdistinguishing between the I and the other is an enumeration.”16 In other words,for Schwaller, implicit in the primary scission is its relationship toconsciousness and its Unity-in-Diversity. Schwaller explains the primaryscission this way:> Thus, at the origin of all creation, there is a Unity that, incomprehensibly,> must include within it a chaos of all possibilities, and its first> manifestation will be through division. At the origin of all concepts, there> is One and Two, being Three principles where one explains the other,> incomprehensible in itself.… Here is the divine Trinity that is infallibly found at the origin of all things,all arguments and reasoning; the Trinity that supports everything, thefoundation on which the world is built, as everything stems from it. The original Unity contains all possibilities, of being and of nonbeing.Consequently, it is of androgynous nature.17 We have already made reference to this peculiar “primordial androgyny” — thesubject of a whole other book — but again, what Schwaller is pointing out isthat in the topological metaphor of the “differentiation of a primordialNothing,” the inevitability of a OneThree always results: two regions ofbracketed nothing sharing a common surface.Thus we may add the names Ptah, Sekhmet, and Nefertum to our previous table,indicating a common conceptual inheritance lays behind Egypt and the Vedicculture: > 1) Ptah =image [images/00085.jpg]>; > 2) Sekhmet = image [images/00086.jpg]>; > 3) Nefertum = image [images/00084.jpg]>. Our table now looks like this, revealing the commonality of the metaphor:image [images/00087.jpg]> As already mentioned, why the ancients should so consistently view thisprimordial differentiation in androgynous terms is the subject of another bookwhich we eventually hope to write, but for now it is worth noting in this regardsomething else that Schwaller points out:> Do you care to translate this as Father, Spirit, and Son or Osiris, Isis, and> Horus? or Brahma, Siva, and Visnu?You may, but if you are wise and wish not to be led astray, you will say, One,Two, which are Three. This has been represented by initiates for those who needimages, so that they may rally around a tradition, and be bound by what iscalled “religion.”18 In other words, once one comprehends the fact that the assignation of variousgods’ names to the topological metaphor is just that, an assignation, then oneunderstands that any assertion of a primordial trinity is, in fact, not theconsequence of religious revelation or metaphysics, but ascietifico-philosophical first principle needing no faith, but rather, a kind ofbelief in the character of the formally explicit metaphor, for that metaphor canbe described in the highly abstract symbolisms of topology itself.Which again raises an important question, one that Schwaller touches upon, andthat we have already noted: why do the ancient cultures and civilizations insiston assigning predominantly masculine images to describe what is otherwiseunderstood as an androgyny, including, as he avers, even the Christian doctrineof the Trinity? Again, any commentary on this aspect of the perplexing choice ofimages would require another entire book in order to reconstruct the process ofreasoning that led to it, but it is important at this juncture to point out thatSchwaller was indeed alive to the fact that this was both a topological and asexual metaphor:> Absolute Unity is the hidden God of the Jews, the unknown God who is> incomprehensible; the Unutterable of the Egyptians. It is sat, the “Being” of> the Brahmans…… A surface, the first incomprehensible form, must have at least three sides.Three sounds form the perfect chord; male, female, and issue form the species;two elements and one mean term are the fundament of all reasoning, allaesthetics, all calculation, and so forth. … It is the God of Gods.19 The world emanates from the God of Gods by the merefact that “he contemplates his own face,” which is the splitting in two, thescission, the first of all functions: division.This much holds for all livingthings…20 Note the close connection, once again, between the physical medium in thismetaphor, and to consciousness itself in Schwaller’s view. As soon as the firstprimordial differentiation occurs, there arises, in Schwaller’s words,“generation, cause, and condition of becoming, and hence there is harmony,” thatis to say, analogy.21 The medium in effect, in this process, createsinformation, and becomes par excellence the transmutative “Philosophers’ Stone.”It is because of this constant activity of differentiation, of the endlesscreation of more and more information, that one may speak of the primaryscission or differentiation as being the ultimate metaphor of non- equilibrium,and of the fact that information, once created, is never lost. This is the basisfor the ancients’ belief that immortality was less a matter of faith, than offact, or, as Schwaller put it, “it is impossible to kill a being born withinNature, be it mineral or man,”22 for such creations emerge first as ever morerefined differentiations of Nothing; they have specific information content.Schwaller’s emphasis on number as a function of the topological metaphor and ofgeometry is crucial. Number is a function because it emerges simultaneously withthe first primordial trinity: “it has its function because it exists only asrelationship.”23 It thus inhabits that Platonic world of the “eternal ideas,”for number-as-topological function “shows us intelligibly that all proceeds fromUnity and returns to it through diversity. This diversity is precisely our worldcreated in the image of the Eternal World’s example.”242. The Tectratys, and Pyramids as Analogical Machines At this juncture, we must consider the origin of the number four, and what itsfunction is within the esoteric Egyptian cosmology. No esoteric symbol moreperfectly epitomizes the functional significance of this number than does theSacred Tectratys of the Pythagoreans, which Schwaller discusses at length. Thesymbol is simplicity itself:image [images/00088.jpg]> This symbol, as we shall see, contains within it yet more deeply encoded“paleophysics” and is yet another expression of the topological metaphor.The first thing to observe is that the Tectratys is a two dimensional analogueof a Pyramid; it symbolizes, therefore, the primordial mound or Mount Meru ofthe Hindus, the primordial mound of the Egyptian Zep Tepi or “first time.” Assuch, it is a symbol of the primary scission or differentiation and the processof creation as it emerges in the physical medium. “We can already understand,”says Schwaller, “that the pyramid with square base best represents the square(base) of the four triangular Elements (its faces). Four times the triangle —this by necessity is the pyramid.”25Esoterically, then, the four layers of the Tectratys represents the emergence ofthe four elements — Fire, Air, Water, Earth — from which the ancients maintainedthe rest of the world, and all its differentiations, were created by variousadmixtures and combinations of those four elements:image [images/00089.jpg]> Scwhaller De Lubicz’s Table of Correspondences of the Four Elements with thePythagorean Sacred Tectratys26 Schwaller comments on this as follows:> Why are the four numbers of the decade called “Elements”?To answer, we must first of all set aside the arithmetic habit so as to see ineach of these numbers, no longer the addition of units, but a new entityaltogether, a new unity. There is the unity One, the unity Two, the unity Three,the unity Four. Each is a unity that in turn can give birth as a unity. … … the metaphysical Decade and formed matter begins only with the number four.27 Leaving aside once again the “androgynous metaphor” that a “unity” gives birth,what does Schwaller mean by each number being a new entity, a new unity untoitself? And why should the number four signify the beginning of the materialcreation for this esoteric symbol and doctrine?Let us recall a remark that Schwaller made earlier, namely, that the elementalsymbol for the primordial differentiation or “primary scission” was fire. Inother words, Schwaller, the mathematician, is saying that the Sacred Tectratysis a symbol of the topological metaphor, and its first three differentiations orderivatives. The number defines the derivative of a specific set of information,what Schwaller calls an “entity” or “unity,” in the continual process of evermore differentiations. The number, in short, describes a node in the tree oftopological descent of an entity from the medium.But why does four symbolize, in this system, the emergence of the actualmaterial creation? In my book The Giza Death Star I pointed out that the SacredTectratys also functioned not only as a symbol of the topological metaphor, butalso of the emergence of geometrical dimensions:image [images/00090.jpg]> The Tectratys as a Metaphor of the Emergence of Geometrical and PhysicalDimensionality28 Additionally, I also pointed out it can function as a metaphorical symbol ofparticle physics:image [images/00091.jpg]> The Tectratys as a Metaphor of Particle Physics29 These two charts exhibit the fact that the Sacred Tectratys functions as asymbol of “unified intention,”30 that is, it is yet another legacy from a VeryHigh Civilization with a sophisticated physics. With that in mind, let us lookagain at the assertion that the material creation emerges with the number four,and is connected to combinations of the four “primal elements,” Fire, Air,Water, andEarth, for these things could themselves be understood as metaphorsfor the four basic forces of the standard model of quantum mechanics: the strongand weak nuclear forces, the force of electromagnetism, and the force ofgravity:image [images/00092.jpg]> The question inevitably arises, why need one stop with a tectratys? Why not havea Pentactys?:31image [images/00093.jpg]> The answer, of course, is that there is no reason this cannot be done. It is,however, important to understand what doing so means: it means nothing less thanthat the Tectratys-Pentactys symbolism is a metaphor for the technique ofhyper-dimensional geometry, as the extension of our previous table showing thegeometrical-dimensional symbolism shows:image [images/00094.jpg]> As we shall see in chapter thirteen, there is actually a mathematical techniquefor describing objects — “solids” — in more than three spatial dimensions, andwe shall discover profound cluesthat some pyramidal structures are deliberatelydesigned as analogues — there’s that key word again! — of these things.However, we can safely say at this stage that, from the esoteric viewpoint,pyramids are analogically-conceived hyper-dimensional machines, for as Schwallerhas pointed out, they are three dimensional versions of the Sacred Tectratys,and all the multi-layered symbolism and implied hyper-dimensionality and subtlephysics metaphorically embodied in that symbol. As it is a symbol of the primaryscission, of the primordial differentiation within the physical medium, as asymbol of the topological metaphor itself, this means that by implication, theyare analogically-conceived machines designed to manipulate theinformation-creating processes of the physical medium itself.Are there other indicators that pyramids can function as such devices? A trip toGiza will provide an astonishing answer.image [images/00095.jpg]> Rene Adolphe Schwaller de Lubicz 1 R.A.

Schwaller points out onthis page that the Pentactys is the origin of the Pythagorean 3:4:5 triangle."},{"pageContent":"12 THE GEARS OF GIZA: THE CENTER OF THE MACHINE > “There is no doubt that within the Pyramid’s fabric are encoded many> scientific laws and formulas,> but the preservation of such knowledge can scarcely have been the only> motive of its builders. Its numerical properties must surely have had some> practical purpose in relation to the form of science> which the Pyramid was designed to serve.”> John Michell1Giza lies at the center of the machine that was the world grid, for as we haveobserved, the ancient world prime meridian, and the placement of so many siteson the world Grid, are oriented with Giza being the prime meridian, and morespecifically, with the prime meridian running through what would have been theapex of the Great Pyramid. Giza is, so to speak, the transmission gears at thecenter of the “machine” of the Grid, a great alchemical machine to manipulatethe Grid itself.But Giza and its pyramids are more than just gears in a machine; it is also analchemical working of a very different sort, for they have exercised atransforming fixation on the human imagination itself.As was seen in the previous chapter, the Sacred Tectratys of the Pythagoreansprovided an entrance into a consideration of the profoundly analogical nature ofancient thinking, and suggested that the Pyramid builders — at least of Egyptand Mesopotamia — may have been conceiving of the structures as analogicalmachines to manipulate the physical medium itself. The Tectratys, we alsoobserved, could also be understood as a symbol of the techniques of manipulatinghigher dimensional geometries, and thus, the symbol, as a two dimensionalanalogue of the Pyramid itself, implies that, from the esoteric perspective atleast, the actual pyramids of that part of the world may have been intentionallyconceived as hyper- dimensional “machines.”However, it may be objected that reading Pythagoreanism’s most sacred symbolback into Egypt and its pyramids is a bit of an anachronism, and hence, beggingthe question. This problemdeserves some attention, for it directly addresses theproblem of the relationship of the post-Cosmic War elites, the monuments — ormachines — they left behind, and the attempts of their successors in the mysteryschools to interpret and understand them. Schwaller understood this processwell, for he was not reading Pythagoreanism back into Egypt, but rather, arguingthat their teachings were based both upon their long heritage and connectionwith a lost and vanished civilization, and upon observation of and reflectionupon the man-made mountains of stone that surrounded them. The machines were thetexts, and the Pythagoreans their interpreters.A. The Pyramids as Texts:Gematria and Esoteric Approaches to the Pyramids But if this be the case, is there any further evidence that the Pyramids werethe source for other types of esoteric speculation, and, if so, does thatspeculation disclose further clues corroborating the idea that they wereconceived, esoterically at least, as analogical, alchemical, andhyper-dimensional machines?These is indeed such evidence, and it comes from the ancient esoteric science ofgematria.Gematria is the practice of assigning numerical values to certain letters of anancient alphabet. Anyone who has studied ancient Greek, or Hebrew, for example,knows that the letters of those alphabets were also assigned numerical valuesand, indeed, were used as numbers. This fact gave rise to a practice of lookingfor numerical codes embedded within ancient texts. Not surprisingly, there werenumerous examples of the phenomenon.We noted in the previous chapter that the pyramidal form was a three dimensionalanalogue to the primordial mound from which, in the ancient cosmologies,everything arose. It is thus also symbolic, as it were, of the primordial“phallus,” symbolic of the> instruments of the union between cosmic and terrestrial force by which the> earth is made fertile. The same symbolism is apparent in the word πυραµις> (pyramid), of which the number in gematria is831, this number being also> obtained by the addition of the values of the letters in the word φαλλος> (phallus).2 The point, once again, is not the anachronistic reading of Greek gematria intothe time of the Giza pyramids, but rather the fact that for esoteric tradition,there was evidence that they exercised a hold over the imagination, which soughtto explain them in functional terms, as machines manipulating the cosmic forcesof creation itself.3Michell himself, whom we have cited above, also points out another esotericsignificance, represented by the Great Pyramid and its nearly perfectconstruction:> It has, however, often been observed that the Great Pyramid is not apparently> of native Egyptian construction. Like the earliest and most perfect temples of> Mexico, it related to world geography in a way which indicates that it> belonged to some universal system in the forgotten past. Ever and again,> studies of ancient civilizations trace them back from their declines to their> high origins — beyond which the trail ends, with no trace of any previous> period of cultural development. The great riddle in the quest for the origin> of human culture is that civilizations appear suddenly, at their peak, as if> ready-made.4 The Great Pyramid — and to a lesser extent as we shall see, the other largepyramid of Giza — thus symbolizes, in its perfection, the riddle of the rise ofcivilizations itself, for it one grants it an antiquity pre-dating Egypt itself,then who built it, and why? That question, as we shall discover, is intimatelyrelated to the cosmological and quantum physics knowledge encoded at NabtaPlaya.However, given that the esoteric tradition was capable of viewing the pyramidsof Giza in general and the Great Pyramid in particular in functional terms, asmanipulators of the cosmic forces of creation,one is entitled to view them asalchemical works, on a planetary scale.5It was, in fact, one of Napoleon’s scientists and scholars, who accompanied thefuture French Emperor on his abortive expedition to Egypt, E.-F. Jomard, whofirst observed that the Great Pyramid’s builders had to have had “an accurateknowledge of the earth and the solar system, and that its inner King’s Chamberwas air-conditioned by vents to hold an even temperature, thus making it anideal repository for standards of weight and measure.”6 Indeed, as I observed inThe Giza Death Star, the Great Pyramid functions as an analogue of nearly everyknown property of local physical and celestial mechanics, including, in myopinion, encoding various coefficients of the constants of quantum mechanics,just as Nabta Playa also encoded stunning astronomical and quantum mechanicaldata.7A review of some of these analogues in the Great Pyramid is in order, for theypoint, at the minimum, to its heavily alchemical and functional purpose: > 1) The structure appears, like so many other structures from ancient times,> to embody systems of measure closely approximating the modern British imperial> system of measurement, with the “pyramid inch” equal to about 1.0011 American,> or 1.00108 British inches;8> 2) The ratio of the apothem (the face slant to height) and the base of the> Great Pyramid yields the value of the constant φ, which is 1.61818, the basis> of the Fibonacci sequence (1,1,2,3,5,8,13..etc), a sequence not known until> ca. 1200 A.D.;9> 3) The approximate length of the base of the Pyramid, expressed in “pyramid> cubits,” is 365.24 cubits, an analogue of the number of days in a year, which> requires knowledge of celestial mechanics;10> 4) The approximate height of the Pyramid times 109 is close to the mean> radius of the Earth’s orbit around the sun;11> 5) Doubling the perimeter of the bottom of the Coffer in the King’s Chamber,> and multiplying it by 108 yields the mean distance to the Moon;12> 6) The scale of 1:43200 is embodied in the pyramid, which, if one takes an> approximate measure of its height, multiplies it by 43,200, yields 3938.684> miles, the approximate polar radius of the Earth.13To top all this off — and it is but a short review of a much longer list — as Ialso pointed out, there are analogues of the coefficients of the Plank Constant,the Planck Length, and the Planck mass present in the structure, constants thatwould not be (re-) discovered until the early twentieth century.14The confluence of the fact that so many analogues of celestial mechanics and ofquantum mechanics are built into both the Great Pyramid and Nabta Playa, plusthe fact that the three large pyramids of Giza conform to the placement of thethree stars in the belt of Orion, suggest that one and the same basis ofknowledge, if not the same group, was involved in the construction of bothplaces.That raises the chronological problem posed by Giza.B. The Dating and Design of Giza, and the Chronology Problem The problem of the dating of the Giza compound is complex, and recently becamemuch more so with the revelation by Dr. Robert Schoch that the water-erosion onthe Sphinx meant that it was far older than dynastic Egypt, requiring a date ofbetween 5000-7000BC.15 But this, according to alternative researcher AlanAlford, implied that the whole question of dating the Giza compound itself hadto be re-thought, for the compound itself as a whole was laid out according toan intricate geometrical plan, a plan which included the Great Pyramid, and that> encompassed the Sphinx, its temples, the causeway and Khafre’s pyramid, for it> would seem that the position of the two Sphinx temples was determined by two> intersection lines drawn from both of the two giant pyramids. Indeed, when we> add to these relationships the common use of megalithic-style masonry in the> temples of both (sic) Sphinx and pyramids, it is easy to see why Egyptologists> view all the structures of Giza as intimately linked, and thus roughly> contemporary. The important implication of this is that one reliable dating> has the potential to date all structures on the Giza plateau, hence the> redating of the Sphinx is not an isolated issue, but has fundamental> implications for our understanding of Egyptian history, and particularly the> so-called ‘Pyramid Age.’16 Close comparison of the construction quality evident in the structures at Gizarevealed to Alford that there are at least three levels, or periods, involved,and it is worth citing what I remarked about Alford’s conclusions in The GizaDeath Star Deployed: > The Sphinx, the temples, and the two giant pyramids at Giza were already> present at the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty, and (the pharaohs) Khufu and> Khafre simply adopted and refurbished them, accounting for the radiocarbon> dating anomalies. The society that designed and built the structures> disappeared long before the Egyptians occupied them, with an intervening> period where the site was maintained by a small and elite priesthood. Thus, in> Alford’s scenario, there are three distinct levels of the cultural occupation> of Giza: > • The first level, responsible for the original construction of the major> structures…> •The second level, a “remnant” or elite priesthood left behind at, or that> came to occupy, the site…> •The third level, the Egyptian civilization itself.17Thus, adopting Alford’s conclusions and modifying them somewhat, I came to theconclusion that there were three levels, represented by three increasinglydeclining levels of construction perfection evident at Giza: > 1) The oldest level, comprising the Great Pyramid itself, antedating ca.> 10,000:> a) since the re-dated Sphinx belongs to the second “less perfect” level of> construction evident at Giza;> b) since the Sphinx had been re-dated by Dr. Robert Schoch, based on its> water erosion, to ca 5000-7000 BC; and,> c) since there are ancient traditions that record the fact that when the> Great Pyramid did have its casing stones on it, that a water mark was visible> halfway up the structure, indicating that it antedated the agreed-upon date> among alternative researchers for the flood, ca. 10,000 BC;> 2) The second, younger, but still pre-Egyptian level, lying somewhere between> 10,000 BC and the Fourth Dynasty millennia later, represented by the Second> Pyramid, the Sphinx, the various Sphinx temples, and possibly the third large> Pyramid, Menkaure; and,> 3) The final, youngest, and purely Egyptian level, represented by the> remainder of the structures at Giza, the causeways and the six smaller> pyramids and also possibly by the third large Pyramid, Menkaure.18But now the problem of dating grows more acute, for if one dates the first andsecond levels of Giza to antedate Egypt itself, the problem becomes one offixing Giza within the wider context of the rest of the Grid, and especially interms of the context and implied technologies evident at such sites as PumaPunkhu, for one and the same technological skill is implied at both sites, andin both chronological levels of construction.A closer look at Alford’s logic is in order, for now it obtains truly globalproportions. Let us recall his words, and then unpack the logic contained inthem, to see how it applies to the question of the world Grid:> Indeed, when we add to these relationships the common use of megalithic-style> masonry in the temples of both (sic) Sphinx and pyramids, it is easy to see> why Egyptologists view all the structures of Giza as intimately linked, and> thus roughly contemporary. The important implication of this is that one> reliable dating has the potential to date all structures on the Giza plateau,> hence the redating of the Sphinx is not an isolated issue, but has fundamental> implications for our understanding of Egyptian history, and particularly the> so-called ‘Pyramid Age.’19 Unpacking the logic reveals the implications:> 1) Egyptology views the structures of Giza as being intimately related and> “roughly contemporary,” i.e., as stemming from Egyptian culture, because of> the geometrical design of the site and “the common use of megalithic-style> masonry” evident in the Sphinx, the Valley Temples, and the three large> pyramids;> 2) But redating the Sphinx threw all those structures back into a period> prior to Egypt, and into what Alford calls a Pyramid Age.In short, to say, as does Alford, that the Sphinx and Valley temples at Gizarepresent megalithic constructions is to raise the question of theirrelationship to other such structures around the world, for those too are workedout according to a grand plan with respect to Giza itself; they were executedover a prolonged time, and they thus exhibit the same three declining levels ofconstructional expertise. It is to highlight the even greater antiquity of theGreat Pyramid, upon whose apex the rest of the Grid was laid out, using it for aprime meridian!We thus tentatively advance the following expansion of Alford’s thesis,realizing the enormous difficulties that it represents. We do so, however, onthe basis that the levels of constructional expertise and precision should bethe primary determinants of assigning a site and its construction to one of thethree periods or “levels”:> 1) The oldest level, comprising the structures that reveal extreme precision> of dressing and fitting stones, and a technology to do so, not obtainable> today, or exhibiting precision alignments not obtainable today. This level> would thus include sites such as Titicaca and Pumu Punkhu in Bolivia, and the> Great Pyramid, both antedating 10,000 BC, since:> a) The re-dated Sphinx belongs to the second “less perfect” level of> construction evident at Giza;> b) since the Sphinx had been re-dated by Dr. Robert Schoch, based on its> water erosion, to ca 5000-7000 BC;> c) since there are ancient traditions that record the fact that when the> Great Pyramid did have its casing stones on it, that a water mark was visible> halfway up the structure, indicating that it antedated the agreed-upon date> among alternative researchers for the flood, ca. 10,000 BC;> d) Native traditions in South America place the dating of Pumu Punkhu to> a period that also antedates the flood, as was seen in previous chapters;> e) It should be noted also that one might be looking at yet a fourth> level, represented by structures such as the great henges of Europe and> Britain, and sites such as Nabta Playa. One is in the presence of a dilemma> here, which we mention, but, at this juncture, do not speculate upon, namely,> that of the relationship of these sites to those of the Great Pyramid and Puma> Punkhu: which is older? the high-tech productions of Puma Punkhu and the Great> Pyramid, or the megalithic constructions of Europe and Nabta Playa?20> 2) The second, younger, but still pre-Egyptian level, lying somewhere between> 10,000 BC and the Fourth Dynasty millennia later. This level is represented by> a decline in the quality of construction, but still exhibiting great> sophistication and precision, and would represented by the Second Pyramid, the> Sphinx, the various Sphinx temples, and possibly the third large Pyramid,> Menkaure, in Giza, and possibly by Teotihuacan and similar sites elsewhere,> since Native American Indian tradition ascribes that site to the construction> of “the gods,” and it exhibits correspondingly similar sophistication; and,> 3) The final, youngest, level, represented by the remainder of the structures> at Giza, the causeways and the six smaller pyramids and also possibly by the> third large Pyramid, Menkaure, and also represented by constructions such as> Tikal, Chichen Itza, Anghkor Wat, and the various temples in India.21The positioning of all three levels with respect to a “Giza Prime Meridian”suggests that there was a continuity of ideology among those building thevarious structures around the world, and that suggests the presence andcontinuity of a hidden elite.There is further testimony of the presence of an elite at Giza, an elite ofgreat antiquity, and this comes, once again, from the astronomical work of Dr.Thomas G. Brophy.Led by the data of Nabta Playa to consider a similar approach to Giza, Brophyminced no words as to the antiquity, if not of all the structures at Giza, thenat least of the design by which they were laid out, which, like Nabta Playa,were aligned to the Galactic Center:> • The monuments function as ground and sky maps to signify the time and> location in the sky of the culmination of the Galactic Center.> • The monuments function as a clock to mark the passage of the Zodiac Age of> Leo, and to calibrate the start of the precession cycle to the culmination in> the sky of the Galactic Center.22These considerations led to the all-important question:> When were the monuments designed? The data evidences that the Giza plateau> monuments design plan was either created more than 12,900 years ago and> developed over a several thousand year period; or it was created by a people a> people with astronomical calculation and conceptual design abilities rivaling> our own, at some time before or contemporary with the large construction> events at Giza around 2,400 BC.23 As is now evident, the perfection and technological skills in evidence at theplateau’s first two levels of construction, the redating of the Sphinx, and thepresence within the Great Pyramid itself of such overwhelming analogies tomodern scientific knowledge point strongly to the first idea, that the site wasdesigned and laid out in high antiquity, by a society or an elite whosescientific and technological knowledge rivaled our own.C. Petrie and Clues to the Machine:The Two Large Pyramids of Giza: Imperfections, or Torsion Analogues?1. The Vedic Clue: Dynamic Torsion Angkor Wat, as we saw, disclosed a profound clue into the ancient Vediccosmology, a cosmology that we have also seen was closely mirrored by that ofthe ancient Mayans, as well as the Egyptians. But as was also observed, theVedic cosmology was also worked out in close conjunction with the idea ofcounter-rotation, of torsion. There is a further confirmation of this view,again from the Vedic literature, as Brophy points out:> As one example, Vedic Scholar S. Yukteswar noted that the original Vedic> description of the yuga ages gave the yuga durations in 2 sets of four periods> with ratios 4:3:2:1 (4800:3600:2400:1200). addingup to 24,000 years. Modern> translations of the Vedas insert the word “divine” before “years” to create> 360 times 24,000 (or 8,640,000) years as the full yuga epoch.

Yet, the outlineof the basic concept is present in the Vedic cosmology centuries if notmillennia before, and it is from the rotation of the primordial nothing thateverything arises.2. The Twists in The Two Large Pyramids With the concept of dynamic torsion, we begin to approach the end of ourexamination of the Grid, and of the functional nature of at least some of thestructures — the pyramidal ones — upon it.In chapter one, the anomalous yields of early thermonuclear testing led us tospeculate that these yields might have other explanations than the standardexplanations being given at the time, namely, that those bombs were gatingenergy, for a brief moment, from higher dimensions. In that respect, the torsionresearch of Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kozyrev was mentioned, and it isworth recounting what I wrote about him in The Philosopher’s Stone, for theconcept now enters the picture as a possible explanation of the functions ofpyramids as alchemical machines to manipulate the physical medium itself:> Torsion may be defined as a spiraling motion within the fabric of space and> time that folds and pleats the fabric by twisting it. Thesimple analogy of> emptying a soda pop can, and then wringing it like a dishrag, illustrates what> torsion does. The spirals in the can literally fold and pleat, and the can’s> length contracts. This, essentially, is what torsion does to space-time.25 In Korzyrev’s thinking, however, torsion is not an abstract, static thing, butrather a constantly changing, dynamic thing,> for if the basic idea of torsion is that it is related to a rotating system,> then it will be apparent that the universe is composed of rotating systems> within other rotating systems, producing a continuously changing system with a> changing flow of time… time itself takes on dynamic properties. > Such complex, interlocked systems of rotation may be thought of as “knots”> of space-time that are so intensely concentrated that they form the objects> observed in the physical universe. As such, all systems are in fact> “space-time machines,” and since they “contain” space-time they are not> ultimately “constrained” by it, but rather, interact constantly, and in some> cases, instantaneously, with it.26 The Vedic cosmology says essentially the same thing, and consequently, if onepresses the speculation a great deal, one may say that it is saying that torsionforms the ultimate basis for the declined alchemical analogical magic soprevalent in the legacy civilizations.With these thoughts in mind, we now take a closer look at the two large pyramidsof Giza, for there we find the idea of torsion, of a twist, present in thestructures themselves. It was the renowned Italian metrologist Stecchini whoobserved that the Great Pyramid’s four sides were all of slightly differentlengths and angles from each other, producing a slight twist to the northwestcorner of the structure.27Many who have studied the Great Pyramid have commentedon this feature, calling it a “slight imperfection” and other such phrases.But is it?Given all the other extraordinary perfection in the structure, we must askwhether this is a likely explanation, or if this twist in the structure is thereintentionally?There are two things arguing for its intentionality. The first is, as we haveseen, the deeply esoteric connection between Egyptian cosmology and the moreancient topological metaphor contained within it, a metaphor connecting it toother ancient cosmologies. Within that metaphor, as we saw, the pyramid itselfis seen as an analogue to the whole cosmic process of differentiation. If, as wealso suggested, the Great Pyramid could possibly stem from a time ofconstruction somewhere in High Antiquity, such scientific concepts might havebeen very well-known and deliberately built-in to the structure.But there is a much stronger argument that suggests this twist was fullyintentional, and that is the fact that the second large pyramid of Giza also hassuch a twist. The great archaeologist and surveyor of Giza, Sir William FlindersPetrie, whose The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh form the “bible” for any seriousGiza research, detailed a number of curious features about the Second Pyramid.Observing that the top of the Second Pyramid still has some of its casing stoneson it, and taking theodolite readings on the angles, Petrie stated that “Fromthis it is seen that the builders skewed round the planes of the casing as theywent upward; the twist being +1’40’’ on the mean of the sides; so that it isabsolutely — 3’50’’ from true orientation at the upper part.”28 Additionally,unlike the Great Pyramid, whose alignment to the four cardinal compass pointsare almost perfect, the Second Pyramid is twisted even further off alignment tothe true compass points; in short, the structure itself is twisted, and inaddition, twisted off center relative to the compass points.29The significance of the two large pyramids being twisted is not, in our opinion,accidental, for there is a third consideration that points, once again, verydeliberately to the idea that the compound was designed as an analogue oftorsion. In The Giza Death Star Deployed I pointed out that when one runs anaxis of rotation through the apexof the Great Pyramid, and then rotates thecompound through 120 and 240 degrees, two familiar forms result.image [images/00096.jpg] Middleton-Jones’ and Wilkie’s Overhead Rotation of Giza through 120 Degrees30 Note that the slight offset of the three large pyramids (remembering that theGreat Pyramid is the center of rotation in the above diagram) yields athree-armed swastika, a common symbol of rotation in the Vedic tradition, and ifthe compound were rotated through 90 degree increments, the resemblance would beeven more palpable.Rotation through 120 and then 240 degrees yields an even more striking symbol,and clearly indicates that the Giza compound was deliberately designed to berotated, if not in reality, then at least conceptually:image [images/00097.jpg] Middleton-Jones’ and Wilkie’s Rotation of Giza Through 240 Degrees31 So what do we have? We have at least three levels of rotation taking place atGiza:> 1) Each of the two large pyramids is twisted from bottom to top, with the> Great Pyramid being oriented slightly off center and toward the northwest> corner;> 2) In addition, both large pyramids deviate from true alignment to the four> compass points, a divergence particularly true in the case of the Second> Pyramid; that is, each is twisted with respect to the Earth itself;> 3) Finally, the whole compound is also designed to rotate.In other words, we have rotation within rotation within rotation, all on thesurface of the Earth, which is rotating on its axis, revolving around the Sun,which is revolving around the Galactic center.32 To put it succinctly, the GizaCompound is an analogy of the concept of dynamic torsion.If, therefore, as engineer Christopher Dunn has argued so persuasively in TheGiza Powerplant, that the Great Pyramid was a machine for the production ofpower, or as I have argued in the Giza Death Star Trilogy that it might actuallyhave been designed or utilized as a weapon of some sort, then this fact, plusthe three chronological levels of construction evident at Giza, and its overalldesign, indicate that the entire compound may have been designed as some sort ofmachine, perhaps even one that modified the original function of the GreatPyramid, the first structure present at the compound on Alford’s alternativescheme of dating. And if the Grid is laid out with respect to Giza, then themachine of which Giza is the center, is truly massive.The only questions that remain are, what was this vast machine designed to do,and how did it do it?This is where the “answers” become highly speculative, and very technical… Notes 1 John Michell, The New View Over Atlantis, p. 149.2 John Michell, The New View Over Atlantis, p. 160.3 Michell also notes that there is a tradition that the casing stones of theGreat Pyramid were “said to have been engraved with letters and symbolsexpressing the entire knowledge of antiquity.” Ibid., p. 137.4 Ibid., p. 162.5 Ibid., pp. 156-157.6 Michell, The New View Over Atlantis, p. 137.7 See my The Giza Death Star (Adventures Unlimited Press, 2001), pp. 161-179.8 Ibid., p. 174.9 Ibid., pp. 174-175.10 Ibid., p. 176.11 Farrell, The Giza Death Star, p. 176.12 Ibid.13 Ibid.14 Ibid., pp. 207-209, 217-221, see also The Giza Death Star Deployed, ch. 9.15 Farrell, The Giza Death Star Deployed, p. 26.

The journey has taken us from Angkor Wat and aninteresting, if disconcerting, masculine-yet-androgynous imagery used tosymbolize the physical medium, to Tiwanaku and Puma Punkhu in Bolivia andanachronistic displays of advanced technology, to Tikal, Chichen Itza, andTeotihuacan in Mexico, to even more disconcerting practices of human sacrificeconnected to the structures, and to bizarre mythological correspondences betweenMesopotamia and the Mayans regarding the engineering of mankind, to curiousmusical codes in Plato, Pythagoras, and the Vedas, to the sands of the Egyptiandesert where a strange megalithic structure encodes quantum mechanical andastrophysical data, to the plateau of Giza, and to yet another example of a“topological metaphor” present in Egyptian cosmology. Along the way we’veencountered Nazis building on the grid, Nazi and Soviet physicists implying“something was wrong” with standard models, and we’ve encountered a strangetopological metaphor and mythological parallels concerning the creation, orbetter put, the engineering of mankind and “Tower of Babel” moments of history,from to Meso- America to Mesopotamia. We have implied along the way that atleast some of these structures — the pyramidal ones — on the world Grid systemwere alchemical hyper-dimensional machines. Certainly in the case of Egypt thecase can be made that, at least from the esoteric point of view, they can be,and possibly were, viewed as such.But can a stronger case be made that this is the case from a mathematical andscientific standpoint? Can one argue that at least some of these structures weremore deliberately and scientifically conceived as “hyper-dimensional” machines,and, if so, what was their purpose?Indeed such a case can be advanced, and that is the task of this final, and mosttechnical, chapter, but before that case can be fully appreciated andunderstood, a reprise of the arguments of the previous chapters is now, finally,in order.A. Summary of the Arguments and Conclusions of the Previous Chapters1. Historical Arguments and Mythological Parallels Our historical arguments and mythological parallels can be summarized asfollows:> 1) There are three overall levels of construction evident throughout the world> in conjunction with constructed structures on the world Grid, and> paradoxically, the older the structures, the higher the technological skill> and scientific knowledge encoded in them is. Yet, the placement of such sites> as Tikal and Teotihuacan on a Grid system that evidently placed the prime> meridian through the Great Pyramid’s apex indicates that some consistent body> of knowledge survived into the later periods of construction, and that this> knowledge may have been the proprietary intellectual culture of a hidden elite> or elites constructing them. > 2) The consistency of the building and placement of objects on the world Grid> system, plus the consistency of the mythological Leitmotifs over time and area> also suggests that a detailed plan was in place that arose from that common> proprietary intellectual culture of that elite. > 3) The high level of scientific knowledge represented by such sites as Giza or> Nabta Playa, or for that matter, Teotihuacan, indicate a degree of scientific> knowledge that could only have come down from High Antiquity from a> civilization and scientific culture equally, if not more, sophisticated as our> own. Additionally, some sites, such as Puma Punkhu, exhibit stone working> technology equally as if not more sophisticated than our own, and thus a> technological sophistication equal if not exceeding our own. It is thus> reasonable to seek scientific rationalizations for the functions of these> structures on the world Grid. > 4) Curiously, as we also saw, the Mayan mythology parallels that of the> Mesopotamian in its assertion that mankind was an engineered creature to> function basically as the slave or servant of the gods. There is even present> in the Mayan mythology a Tower of Babel moment in which mankind is embarked> upon a project that somehow threatens the gods’ power over it, and> accordingly, a political decision is taken to end that project, whatever it> was. It is my speculation that this project was intimately connected to the> pyramid building and other constructions associated with the world Grid. The> consistent esoteric association of pyramidal structures with “the gods” is an> indicator that such structures were associated with the knowledge — that is to> say, the science and technology — of “the gods”, and this is particularly the> case with the esoteric traditions surrounding the Giza complex, Teotihuacan,> and the sites of Meo-America. Again, this argues that scientific> rationalizations for the functional purpose of such structures should at least> be entertained. > 5) In more modern times, the lithium-7 explanation for the anomalous yields of> early hydrogen bomb testing was suggested to be a smokescreen and a deliberate> lie on the part of the U.S. government, for the following reasons: > a) Lithium-7 fusion reactions were clearly known, and openly talked about, by> Nazi-Argentine scientist Dr. Ronald Richter in connection with his “fusion”> project for Argentine President Juan PerThis project attracted world> attention, and, as I demonstrate in my book The Nazi International, the> considerable covert attention of American military and scientific authorities,> such that his explanations of lithium-7 reactions were known months before the> USA claimed it had not considered its fusion reactions when it designed and> tested the Castle Bravo device. In the historical context proffered by> Richter’s project in Argentina, in other words, the post-Castle Bravo> explanations seem ridiculous, for we are being asked to believe American> scientists did not account in their design for a reaction that was well-known> to other nuclear engineers, Nazis, Soviets, and Argentines among them! > b) Richter made it clear in his explanations both to Argentine and American> authorities that he regarded a rotating and stressed plasma to be a key for> tapping into the zero point energy itself, that is to say, he viewed fusion> reactions within rotating and precessed plasmas as hyper- dimensional> geometries gating energy into the fusion reaction itself. Similar suggestions> were, as noted in chapter one, made by the Soviet astrophysicist Dr. Nikolai> Kozyrev in connection to observations made about the sun itself. In short, it> was suggested that the early h-bomb tests were returning anomalous yields> because they tapped into geometries of the local physical medium itself, and> since those geometries changed constantly, the yields of thermonuclear devices> of the same design would also change slightly depending on the time and place> of the test, i.e., depending upon the geometry of space time itself, and in> conjunction with the energies of the earth Grid. It consequently became a> highly and deeply classified secret of an “off-the-books” physics. > c) It was also shown that, apparently, the Nazis prior to and during World War> Two had at least some knowledge, howsoever rudimentary it may have been, of> this system, since they placed their transmitters and other installations are> key points along that part of the Grid that fell under their control. > 6) Finally, we also noted in the case of Meso-America and South America that> at some later point the practice of human sacrifice arises in connection with> certain sites on the Grid, as one elite is replaced by another, thus signaling> the presence of two elites, with different understandings of how to manipulate> the world Grid. How, then, does one rationalize this practice — if it can be> rationalized at all — in connection with the speculative scientific> rationalizations of the functional purpose of such structures and sites? To> put it as bluntly as possible, why does sacrifice arise in conjunction with> the pyramids of Mexico and Meso-America, and not in conjunction with those of> Egypt? > a) While this is not the book to address either this bizarre and cruel fact,> nor that of the disconcerting and curious imagery of “masculine-androgyny”> associated with the topological metaphors in some cultures, its presence in> one place and its absence in the other does tend to suggest that one elite> prevailed in one place, and the other in the other place. > b) We also saw that the logic used to justify the practice of sacrifice was> curiously similar in the case of the Aztecs, and the Christian archbishop> Anselm, and that in each case, that logic relied upon the idea of a debt> mankind owed to the gods, a “spiritual economics” that was impossible for> mankind ever to repay, a step that effectively made “the gods” or “God”> nothing but banksters. 2. The Strange Topological Metaphor We also encountered, in conjunction with the cultures — Vedic, Mayan, andEgyptian — that have built pyramidal structures and associated them with thegods, and with their activities and knowledge, a strange mythological andcosmological parallel that we have called simply “the topological metaphor”:> 7) In the Vedic, Mayan, Egyptian, and even Hermetic cosmology, all creation> arises out of differentiations in a primordial “nothing” which is variously> described as a primordial ocean or sea, an imagery consistently used in> ancient literature to describe the fabric of space-time itself. While we saw> evidence of that disconcerting “masculine-androgynous” imagery operative both> in the Vedic and Mayan mythologies in conjunction with this topological> metaphor, further explorations as to the reasons for its presence would> require a book of its own to explore to the degree it requires. But for the> present moment, viewing this primordial Nothing as undergoing a process of> differentiation resulting in two regions with a common surface exhibited the> rise of a “primordial triad,” the regions and common surface themselves, with> the names for each of these three entities varying according to the local> mythology: > a) For the Vedic, the names for these three entities within the topological> metaphor were Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva;3 > b) For the Hermetic, God, Space, and Kosmos;4 > c) For the Mayan, Sky, Sea, and the implied common surface between the two;5> and, > d) For the Egyptian, Ptah, Sekhmet, and Nefertum.6 > The presence and persistence of this metaphor throughout such disparate> cultures — all of them engaged in pyramid building of one sort or another —> argues strongly from the cultural context that they viewed these structures in> the same way as Nikola Tesla — whose words were cited in the epigrams at the> beginning of this chapter — viewed his own technological quest, as the means> “to get a grip on the earth” and to cause the movements of the aether to stop> and start, i.e., as the machines by which to manipulate the physical medium> itself. > 8) The strong association of the topological metaphor of the physical medium> with consciousness itself also implies that, for these ancient cultures, the> pyramidal structures esoterically associated with the physical medium were> also viewed as consciousness manipulators, or, to put it slightly differently,> that these were also alchemical machines for the transformation of> consciousness and social engineering itself.7 3. The Types of Numerical Coding > 9) In our survey in previous chapters of the pyramidal portions of the world> Grid, we also encountered not only three levels of construction activity and> corresponding scientific and technological sophistication, but also three> distinct kinds of numerical coding involved: > a) The geographical coding, elaborated by Carl Munck, Graham Hancock, and> other capable Grid researchers, that discloses that Giza and its Great Pyramid> were used as a prime meridian. > i) Additionally, as Thom, Munck, and others have also pointed out, use of> English imperial measures also seems to have been at work in the measuring> andpositioning of some of these sites long before the system was actually> “English;”8 > b) The esoterical numerical coding, embodied in at least three distinct ways: > i) The emergence of number itself as functions of the topological metaphor, as> in the examination of the topological metaphor conducted by R.A. Schwaller de> Lubicz in conjunction with the Egyptian version of the metaphor; > ii) The use of numerical codes in the Platonic, Pythagorean, and Vedic> tradition to denote not only certain gods in their respective pantheons, but> also as musical codes to denote various schemes of tuning, and the use of> these codes in turn to denote the astrological and astronomical data of the> celestial “music of the spheres;” and, > iii) The use of gematria, or numerical coding in texts.From all these esoteric> points of view, once again, the tradition tends to view pyramidal structures> as the primordial mounds of “the first time” whence creation in all its> diversity emerges. They are, so to speak, the metaphorical phallic symbols of> that disconcerting image of androgyny one also so often encounters in the> ancient cosmologies. > c) The strictly scientific numerical encoding, which occurred, as was seen, at> two levels in the same structures: > i) Codes referring to macrocosmic processes, or to the physics of large> systems, that is to say, encoded astronomical data; and, > ii) Codes referring to microcosmic processes, or to the physics of small> systems, that is to say, encoded numerical data of quantum mechanics in the> form of references to the coefficients of the constants of quantum mechanics,> or, in the case of the Pythagorean tectratys, the four “elements” or forces of> the standard model of physics, the electromagnetic, gravitational, and the> strong and the weak nuclear forces. Such knowled ge could only come down> fdrom a civilization in High Antiquity with a similar or greater pitch of> scientific development as our own. In this, we are indeed looking at the> presence of alchemical machines in the proper sense, for if these ancient> structures such as Nabta Playa can only reveal their secrets in accordance> with a certain level of scientific sophistication, then indeed it becomes> possible that other such codes await to be unlocked in these structures as our> own scientific knowledge advances; it is thus possible that some of these> sites on the world Grid will thus provoke a transformation and expansion of> consciousness by actually yielding scientific information as yet unknown, if> they can but be properly decoded. The association of these structures with> consciousness manipulation should not seem so surprising by now, for as I> noted in Genes, Giants, Monsters and Men, piezoelectric effects are used in> modern mind manipulation technologies,9 and some ancient temples from> classical times also appear to have been deliberately engineered to be in> resonance with certain frequencies of the human brain.10 It is, oddly enough, point 9)b)ii) above — the use of musical codes in thePlatonic and Pythagorean traditions — rather than the quantum mechanical andastronomical encoding, that points directly to the next necessary stage in ourspeculative case that pyramidal structures are hyper-dimensional machines,designed to manipulate the medium itself, in all its effects, includingconsciousness.In this respect, let us recall something stated in chapter nine:> It is important to note what this notation means, for cubing and squaring a> number — e.g. x3 and x2 — are, of course, geometricalfunctions describing> objects in two or three spatial dimensions. Thus, the notation {2,5} mentioned> above could be written this way more abstractly as {x, y}, and since the first> number is multiplied by the cubic power of 60, and the second by the squared> power of 60, the notation really would look like this:> image [images/00098.jpg]> We can therefore imagine extending this notation to {x,y,z}, and extending the> powers of 60 with which each number is multiplied, e.g. image> [images/00099.jpg] in other words, notations such as {8,0,0}, which are also> within the realm of possibility in ancient Mesopotamian notation, conceivably> may be understood as representing powers of 60 greater than the cubic, that is> to say, as geometric and numerical representations of objects in four or more> dimensions.To state it as succinctly as possible, the very structure of ancientMesopotamian numerical notation implies a basic familiarity withhyper-dimensional geometries and the basic mathematical techniques fordescribing objects in four or more spatial dimensions. Indeed, as we shalldiscover in chapter 13, the exact same notation convention began to be used innineteenth century geometrical techniques for describing objects in four or moredimensions! This contains a further, and very suggestive, implication, for it is to be notedthat the Sumerian-Babylonian gods may be described by such notation. In otherwords, the gods were being described peculiar union of physics and religion, ashyper-dimensional entities or objects.11 As I noted in that chapter in the footnote: “The modern name for such notationsis Schl㥬i numbers, and their appearance in notation is identical, with eachnumber representing a particular type of geometric function. This will beexplored further in chapter 13.”12This is now chapter thirteen, and a closerlook at those mysterious Babylonian notations, so curiously identical to modernSchläi notations, is in order, for in them is contained a profound clue to someof the ancient pyramids, particularly the ones in Mexico and Meso-America.B. Hints of a Hyper-Dimensional Engineering:A Cursory Excursion into Geometry in More than Three Dimensions It has been suggested in some circles that some of the pyramids of the ancientworld, in particular those of Meso-America and Egypt, represent structuresdesigned to engineer the hyper-dimensional physics of the medium. Richard C.Hoagland, for example, performed simple experiments on television recently,using a Bullova watch, powered by a minute tuning-fork, to take measurements ofchanges in the tuning fork’s frequency of vibration at various places near thepyramids of Tikal. When Mr. Hoagland moved away from the structures, thevibrations would return to normal, but near or on the structures, the vibrationsvaried greatly from their normal frequency, suggesting to him that thatstructures were manipulating local inertial effects. I myself have suggestedthat at least the Great Pyramid was a complex sort of phase conjugate howiztermanipulating longitudinal waves in the physical medium itself.But to argue that the pyramids of Mexico and Egypt in general are designed ashyper-dimensional machines — analogues of objects in higher-dimensional spaces —requires an additional type of analysis, and this can only be had by doing a bitof hyper-dimensional geometry. Unfortunately, presenting the mathematicaltechniques that geometers use to analyze such objects to a lay readership is noeasy task, but inevitably, some degree of familiarity with these mathematicaltechniques is required, howsoever cursory.Fortunately, we have already encountered, through the work of Carl Munck, theessential analytical conception used by geometers to describe hyper-dimensionalobjects, and that is the simple technique of counting three things: > 1) lines, or e d g e s ; > 2) points, or corners, or, as the geometers call them, vertices; and, > 3) sides, or faces. For our purposes, we shall attempt to summarize crucial conceptions inhyper-dimensional geometry using what may justifiably be described as the singlebest mathematical treatment of the subject: mathematician H.S.M. Coxeter’sRegular Polytopes.1. Geometry in More than Three Dimensions:H.S.M. Coxeter’s Regular Polytopesa. A Brief Biography image [images/00100.jpg] Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter, 1907-2003 One of the twentieth century’s greatest mathematicians, Harold Scott MacDonaldCoexeter, is virtually unknown outside of mathematics, for the speciality thatearned him his fame — hyper- dimensional geometry or geometry in more than threespatial dimensions — requires, needless to say, a powerful pictorial imaginationand the ability to put that imagination into formally explicit and reproducibleequations. Coexter had both, in abundance. Like so many who dwell on that fuzzyboundary between mathematics and the arts, Coxeter was a talented musician,being an accomplished pianist by the age of ten.13Born in London in 1907, Coxeter attended the University of Cambridge, receivinghis B.A. in the subject in 1928 and his P.D. in 1931. He spent a year at thePrinceton University in 1932 as a Rockefeller Fellow, working with the famousmathematician and physicist Hermann Weyl. As the war clouds of World War Twowere gathering, Coexter moved to the University of Toronto in 1936, eventuallybecoming a professor there in 1948. His hyper- dimensional geometry workinspired the famous Dutch artist Maurits Escher, whom Coxeter met.14Coxeter published but few books and papers during his long and distinguishedcareer, but that is hardly surprising, for anyone who has read any of his booksor papers knows that each of them is a higher- dimensional tour-de-force, whosevery equations and diagrams are themselves exercises in alchemicaltransformations and expansions of conciousness, working an almost magical effecton the mind. Of these few publications, Regular Polytopes is his distilledmasterpiece, a model of mathematical rigor and yet, an essay of profound beauty.It is this book, and in particular its all-important opening pages, that weshall follow closely here, for they contain profound clues to unravel themystery of the pyramids, particularly those that depart from the smooth- facedEgyptian model.b. The Essential Imaginative Technique Coxeter’s approach to higher dimensional geometry and its techniques was aprofoundly intuitive and experiential one, notwithstanding the formalmathematics in which it is couched, relying upon the ability of the humanimagination to grasp the basic conceptual principle on which the formalmathematical techniques were based. Typically, his intuitional experientialapproach may be grasped in a series of short, pithy expressions that requiredeliberate thought to unpack. Indeed, Coxeter almost writes as an alchemicalpoet, crowding numerous layers of thought into extraordinarily short sentences.The basic intuitive or experiential technique behind all the more formalprinciples and techniques of higher dimensional geometry may be glimpsed by thesentence that begins the seventh chapter of Regular Polytopes, “OrdinaryPolytopes in Higher Space.” One may, at this point, be asking, “What is a‘polytope’ anyway?” Coxeter answers the question, and in doing so, reveals theintuitive or imaginative technique in play: “POLYTOPE is the general term of thesequence point, segment, polygon, polyhedron…”15Remember the “dimensionalanalysis” of the Pythagorean Tectratys of chapter 12? Coxeter is here saying thesame thing: as one adds dimensions, one is able to describe more and morethings, so that in zero dimensions, one can only describe a point, in onedimension, only a segment of a line, in two dimensions, polygons such astriangles, squares, octagons, and so on, and in three dimensions, polyhedra,such as tetrahedra, cubes, octrahedra, and so on. Coxeter puts this imaginativepoint more precisely as follows:> In space of no dimensions the only figure is a point, Πo. In space of one> dimension we can have any number of point; two points bound a line-segment,> Π1, which is the one-dimensional analogue of the polygon Π2 and polyhedron Π3.> By joining Πo to another point, we construct Π1. By joining Π1 to a third> point (outside its line) we construct a triangle, the simplest kind of Π2. By> joining the triangle to a fourth point (outside its plane) we construct a> tetrahedron, the simplest Π3. By joining the tetrahedron to a fifth point> (outside its 3-space!) we contruct a pentatope, the simplest Π4… The general> case is now evident: any n +1 points which do not lie in an (n-1)- space are> the vertices of an n-dimensional simplex…16The term “polytopes” (Π) thus denotes what happens to polyhedra when they arerotated into more than three dimensions. Or to put it differently, the term“polytope” denotes the common mathematical elements of the same figure invarious dimensions, such as the progression in the above quotation from Coxeter,of “triangle, teatrahedron, pentatope” and so on. Notice also, that in each ofthe two previous examples — polygons in two dimensions and polyhedra in three —that the shapes of the polyhedra result from performing what geometers call an“orthorotation,” or a rotation from two dimensions into a third dimension thatis perpendicular or at 90 degree angles from the other two. The same thinghappens in the rotation from three to four, and from four to five dimensions:each dimensional orthorotation simply adds another spatial dimension to theprevious ones, in a dimension at right angles to all the previous dimensions.Obviously, this cannot exist in a three dimensional space any more than a threedimensional polyhedron can exist in a two dimensional space, but they can bepictured or represented in a two dimensional space, and more importantly, theycan be exactly mathematically described by certain specific techniques that wewill get to in a moment. To put Coexter’s point about polytopes of certain typesbeing analogues — there’s that crucial word again! — somewhat differently, allpolytopes of a specific type — say, triangles, tetrahedra, and pentatopes —share certain properties in common regardless of how many dimensions in whichthey occur; they are, in “physics terms,” all coupled harmonic oscillators toone another across dimensions, and the “coupling” occurs in the numbersthemselves, numbers that in turn result from the regular geometry of theirshape. To boil it all down, all polytopes of a particular species have a “shape”in n-dimensions, and that shape isprojected into the dimensional space in whichit exists — say, two, three, or four dimensions — by certain regularmathematical laws.Now let us observe yet another implication of Coxeter’s always deceptivelysimple remarks, namely, that the simplest way to describe the orthorotation ofany polytope or “shape” from one type of dimensional space to another istetrahed rally. Coxeter puts this point with his customarily deceptively simplestatements: “Two-dimensional polytopes are merely polygons… Three-dimensionalpolytopes are polyhedra…”17A “triangular” shape in two dimensions is a natural oscillator of the same shapein three, four, and more dimensions, and this is the real encoded secret in theSacred Tectratys and Pentactys of the Pythagoreans, for the simple symbol isalso a symbol of this mathematical technique, yet another legacy from HighAntiquity, for it is essential to recall that the Pyragoreans regarded it as akey cosmological secret:image [images/00101.jpg] The Pythagoreans, in other words, were preserving a secret of hyper-dimensionalgeometry, whether they knew it or not, and given all the indications that theyknew the image concealed a great a various multi-leveled meaning, they may,indeed, have had an inkling of it.c. The Essential Mathematical Techniques With these things in mind, we are ready to address the next question: what arethe exact mathematical techniques used to describepolytopes in more than three,or >3, dimensions? Coxeter beginsRegular Polytopes by describing one suchtechnique in detail:> To be precise, we define a p-gon as a circuit of p line-segments A1A2, A2A3,…,> ApA1, joining consecutive pairs of p points A1, A2, …, Ap. The segments and> points are called sides and vertices. Until we come to Chapter VI we shall> insist that the sides do not cross one another. If the vertices are all> coplanar we speak of a plane polygon, otherwise a skew polygon.A plane polygon decomposes its plane into two regions… (Remember our topological metaphor, and that initial differentiation of thedimensionless Nothing into two regions, joined upon a common surface? Coexter isnow describing the same process in two dimensions, via a process ofdifferentiation of a two dimensional Nothing, a “plane”, by means of a regularpolygon whose surface joins its finite interior with its infinite exterior! Inother words, you have been doing higher-dimensional geometry all along, in thetopological metaphor, the only difference between topology and geometry being,that topology is not dealing with geometrical objects, but the spacesthemselves! To return to Coxeter):> …> A plane polygon decomposes its plane into two regions, one of which, called> the interior, is finite. We shall often find it convenient to regard the p-gon> as consisting of its interior as well as its sides and vertices. We can then> re-define it as a simply-connected region bounded by p distinct segments.18Before we distill all this lingua mathematica arcana, there is one morestatement, again from the beginning of the book, worth citing:> A polyhedron may be defined as a finite, connected set of plane polygons, such> that every side of each polygon belongs also to just one other polygon, with> the proviso that the polygons surrounding each vertex form a single circuit(to> exclude anomalies such as two pyramids with a common apex). The polygons are> called faces, and their edges sides. Until Chapter VI we insist that the faces> do not cross one another. Thusthe polyhedron forms a single closed surface,> and decomposes (three dimensional)19 space into two regions, one of which,> called the interior, is finite.20Again, Coxeter has described a process of three-dimensional differentiation of athree-dimensional space by means of a polyhedron.So what is the first basic mathematical principle in evidence in the transitionof any polytope from one system of dimensional spaces to another?It’s so simple that you, the reader, know it already, and have known it sinceelementary school: one counts the> 1) points, or vertices of an object; > 2) the edges, or lines of an object; and > 3) the faces of an object. Thus, a triangle has three vertices, three edges, and one “face”; a teatrahedronfour vertices, six edges, and four faces, and so on. A square has four vertices,four edges, and one “face”; a cube has eight vertices, twelve edges, and sixfaces, and so on.To this technique there is added yet another, and this one is a bit morecomplicated, but it is also the crucial technique. We begin, once again, withCoxeter’s own summation of this technique:> A regular polygon is easily seen to have a centre, from which all the vertices> are at the same distance oR, while all the sides are at the same distance 1R.> This means that there are two concentric circles, the circum-circle and> in-circle, which pass through the vertices and touch the sides, respectively.And, notes Coxeter in the very next sentence, anticipating a physicsapplication:> It is sometimes helpful to think of the side of a p-gon as representing p> vectors whose sum is zero.21In other words, for any regular polygon, such as a square, it is possible todraw a circle whose center shares the center of the square, and whosecircumference touches upon, or is tangent to, the four vertices of the square,which is the circumscribing circle, and it is also possible to draw a circlewhose circumference touches upon, or is tangent to, the edges of the square,which is the circuminscribed circle.But note that Coxeter is describing a process that, like the polygon itself, canbe orthorotated into three or more dimensions, in which case, thecircuminscribing and circumscribed circles, become cicuminscribing andcircuminscribed spheres, and hyper-spheres. But the numbers will be preserved inall dimensional spaces.Now we consider the next most difficult component of these circumscribing andcircumscribed n-circles.22 If we imagine a circle in two dimensions, and asquare within it, obviously the square will touch on four points of acircumscribing circle. If we now instead circuminscribe an octagon, there willbe eight points on touching on the circle. Dividing the octagon again willproduce sixteen touching points, and with each such division, the regularpolygon assumes a shape closer and closer to the circuminscribing circle.Similarly a process in three dimensions with regular polyhedra will more andmore approximate the shape of the circuminscribing sphere. Notably, thecircumference of the circle is, as everyone knows, C=2πr, where C is thecircumference and r is the radius of any given circle. Thus, as the regularpolygons circumscribed in a circle more closely approximate the circle itself,the closer they get to that crucial relationship of 2πr. In other words, therelationship of 2π and its multiples becomes a crucial component of rotationsinto more than three dimensions.23This point about “squaring the circle” is also quite an important technique forthis type of higher dimensional mathematical technique, for it allows geometersto determine the numerical relationships of objects in more than threedimensions to their circuminscribing and circuminscribed hyper-spheres. It is,along with the counting of vertices, edges, and faces (in order to determinewhat type of object one is dealing with), the essential technique.It is this fact that, at least with respect to the Great Pyramid, also meansthat the structure was deliberately conceived as a higher- dimensional analogue,for as most investigators are aware, the Great Pyramid is built as an example of“squaring the circle” and “cubing the sphere,”24 it is built, in other words,according to the very technique of higher-dimensional geometry.25d. Tetrahedral and Octahedral Groups We noted, previously, that there was a peculiar connection between Sumeriannotation and the type of notation used by geometers in higher-dimensionalmathematics. Before exploring that connection, it is worth mentioning that thereis another deep connection between the Sumerian sexagesimal numerical system,based upon multiples of the number 6, and that of higher dimensional geometry.Coxeter notes that in the rotation groups of polyhedra, that there are threegroups in particular:> …(we) have the tetrahedral group of order 12, the octahedral group of order 24> (which is also the rotation group of the cube) and the icosahedral group group> of order 60 (which is also the rotation group of the dodecahedron).26While consideration of rotation groups would far exceed the technicallimitations of presenting higher-dimensional geometries to a general audience,it is worth noting that all these numbers are “Sumerian” in that they are allmultiples of 6! And this brings us at last to the other peculiar Sumerianconnection.e. Schl㥬i Numbers, the Platonic Solids, and Their Extensions Ludwig Schl㥬i (1814-1895) was the Swiss mathematician who first investigatedregular polytopes in more than three dimensions, deriving a simple method ofrepresenting the counting of the numbers of vertices and faces.27 Schl㥬i’snotation convention, for regular polyhedra in three dimensions, is a symbolcomprising two numbers, p and q, which looks like this:{p,q},where p is the number of sides of a face of a regular polygon and q is thenumber of faces around each vertex. A cube would thus look like this:{4,3}with the four denoting the equal sides of a square’s face, with three such facesaround each vertex.28 The notation convention is strongly reminiscent ofSchwaller de Lubicz’s understanding that numbers represent geometricalfunctions, and of the Sumerian notation convention where, similarly, the numbersdenote functions of cubing or squaring, or of some other function ofmultiplication.29 As more dimensions are added, the number expands: {p, q, r…}.C. Counting Faces and Vertices In Mexico and Meso-America We have already observed that the Great Pyramid in particular is an actualanalogue of the technique of squaring the circle, a crucial step in the kind ofanalysis and technique geometers utilize to describe higher-dimensional objects.But expressed in terms of a Schl㥬i number, there is nothing so unique aboutthem; they have five vertices, four triangular faces, and one square face. Onewould have to “adjust” the notation to reflect this fact, but it could be easilydone.It is when one turns to the pyramidal structures in Mexico and Meso-America thatone is confronted with something very interesting, as the following charts anddiagrams of the various pyramids of Teotihuacan and Tikal demonstrate.image [images/00102.jpg] Harrelson’s Overview of the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan30 image [images/00103.jpg] Overview of Small Pyramid At Tikal31 image [images/00104.jpg] Small Pyramid At Tikal: Front View image [images/00105.jpg] Perspective View of Small Tikal Pyramid image [images/00106.jpg] Tikal: Temples I & II: Front, Side, and Overhead Views image [images/00107.jpg] Tikal Temple I: Overhead image [images/00108.jpg] Tikal Temple II: Overhead image [images/00109.jpg] Tikal Temple III: Overhead image [images/00110.jpg] Tikal Temple IV Overhead image [images/00111.jpg] Tikal Temple V Overhead What is immediately apparent in all these examples is that these are not trueregular pyramids, they are elongated, in many cases their vertical orientationis not symmetrical, being skewed off center, and most importantly, as Carl Munckobserved, they also have numerous corners, edges, and faces.Why is this so important?For one thing, just as the two large pyramids at Giza, the skewed off-centervertical alignment suggests once again that they were deliberately conceived asstructures with a twist or rotation, in short, as structures analogous totorsion. And it is important for another reason, because, as Coxeter pointed out,higher dimensional polytopes — and we realize a pyramidal structure is already adeparture from a regular polytope — have numerous vertices, faces, and edges.32And atop each of these structures is a “temple” that, if one looks at themclosely, appear to be designed as some sort of resonant cavity.33 What thisstrongly suggests or implies is that, just as a tetrahedron can be representedor “squished” into a two-dimensional representation or analogue, so too canhigher-dimensional pyramidal objects or constructs be “squished” into athree-dimensional structure that is an analogue of them. This fact, coupled withMr. Richard Hoagland’s simple torsion experiments conducted at Tikal near thesevery pyramids, strongly suggests these structures were deliberately designed ashyper- dimensional analogical, alchemical structures designed to manipulate thephysical medium, and to respond to it.With this in mind, let us return to Sir William Flinders Petrie’s observationsconcerning the Second Pyramid at Giza, remembering the context that the plan ofthe compound is to rotate, producing all those tetrahedral structures seen inthe previous section of this book. Petrie notes that “The lower two courses ofthe casing” of the Second Pyramid “are of granite, very well preserved where itis not altogether removed.”34 In addition to this, “the builders made theface(of the granite casing stones)35 drop down for some depth vertically fromthe edge of the slope, building the pavement against the vertical face.”36Consider what this means.It is known that granite possesses very active piezoelectric properties, givenall the small quartz crystals embedded in it. Thus, in a certain sense, one hasthe piezoelectric analogue of the primary to a Tesla magnifying impulsetransmitter, for the enormous weight pressing down on these casing stones placesthem under constant stress. Furthermore, just as Tesla stated of his owntechnology in the trial transcript cited as an epigraph at the beginning of thischapter, it was necessary for his Wardenclyffe Tower to “grip the earth” inorder to make it quiver. It is equally the case that it is necessary to grip itin order to respond to its natural vibrations.So what do we have, when we combine all these observations about Giza, Mexico,and the wider cosmological myths we have examined in this book?> 1) Present in the Mexican and Giza Pyramids are structural analogues of> rotations and torsion; > 2) The Mexican pyramids also appear, with their multi-cornered edges and> faces, to be some sort of analogues of irregular higher-dimensional objects,> contained within an overall normal pyramidal structure; > 3) The Mexican Pyramids appear to have “temples” atop them that resemble —> qualitatively — resonant cavities; > 4) Their placement and position on the globe is oriented to Giza as a prime> meridian, suggesting that any machine-like function they have is designed to> work in conjunction with that site; > 5) At Giza itself, the compound is designed to rotate, and each of the two> larger pyramids there also is slightly twisted and skewed, thus producing an> analogue of dynamic torsion, that is to say, of rotating systems within> rotating systems; > 6) The Second Pyramid of Giza appears to be a piezoelectric analogue of a> Tesla magnifying impulse transmitter, a technology in turn based upon> manipulating longitudinal electrical waves.37 The conclusion, though tentative, seems inescapable, for we are in the presenceof a machine of planetary extent, designed, at the minimum, to manipulateplanetary energies, if not more, to respond and manipulate the wider system ofever-changing torsion dynamics in the solar system, as would seem to be impliedby all the careful astronomical alignments and data preserved in various sites,particularly at Teotihuacan and Giza. The end result of all of this symphoniccoordination of all the moving parts of this massive globe-spanning constructionin a vast counterpoint, was the transformation of the entire planet Earth itselfinto an alchemical laboratory, a temple of initiation, into the deep physics ofthe medium of the material creation and of consciousness itself.For now, our examination is concluded: at least some of the structures of theGrid, if not the Grid itself, were conceived, designed, and executed over aprolonged period of time as genuinely alchemical objects and analogues of thetransmutative information- creating physical medium itself, to manipulate it forwhatever purpose, including the manipulation of consciousness, for they exercisetheir mysterious hold over the human imagination still. They thus embody anawesome, little understood, power, both for destruction, and very possibly, forprotection.As we sincerely hope has been shown throughout this book, any effort tounderstand the Grid and its function will now have to proceed much morecautiously than previous research has undertaken. Measurements of dimensions ofstructures with an engineer’s eye to potential resonances will have to beundertaken; exacting study of the positioning of sites on the Grid will have tobe made with a view to determine if these locations correspond to sphericallycircuminscribed objects; their positioning in time, and within the overallscheme of the three chronological levels of construction will have to be fixed,and above all, due consideration of the mythological and cosmological context inwhich various cultures explained these structures by Grid researchers will haveto be given, for as we have seen throughout this work, those “myths” contain aprofoundly sophisticated higher-dimensional topological metaphor of the physicalmedium itself.One thing, however, has clearly emerged: there is a definite correspondencebetween those cultures possessing some version of the topological metaphor intheir cosmologies, and the activity of building pyramids or pyramidalstructures, and it is this fact, above all, that suggests these structures’ultimate purpose and function was for the manipulation of the physical medium.38Though we have encountered the disconcerting imagery of a “masculine androgyny”in many of those mythological cosmologies and the “topological metaphor”associated with the cultures surrounding these structures, though we have alsoencountered the strange idea of immortality also associated with them, andthough we have also encountered, in Mexico, the inescapably immoral practice ofhuman sacrifice associated with them, beyond this, for the present moment, wecannot go, as those subjects will require a book of their own to explore fully.But rest assured, those disconcerting images themselves contain profound cluesnot only into the mind of the ancients, but also into the physics and culturalconsciousness that produced them; those images include profound clues into thenature of the topological metaphor itself, and into its ethical and evenaesthetic ramifications.But even though those are subjects for another book, there is one final,tantalizing bit of evidence concerning that disconcerting image of androgyny,and of sacrifice, to consider…1 Nikola Tesla, quoted in “Mr. Tesla’s Invention: How the Electrician’s Lamp ofAladdin May Construct New Worlds,” New York Times, April 21, 1908, citing aletter of Tesla to the New York Times dated April 19, 1908.2 Nikola Tesla, Trial transcript, in answer to a question from the bench; NewYork State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Second Department: Clover BoldtMiles and George C.

It is possible that various points of the Gridare laid out on different coordinate systems that depict the surface pointswhere regular polyhedra intersect with the idealized circuminscribing surface ofthe Earth itself.

Canseliet1It was St. Anselm who first exposed the logic of the alchemy of perpetual debtwhen he raised the question, cur deus homo or “why the God-man?” Indeed, themedieval apologist answered his own question as to why God should leave a throneof universal authority and become the Lamb (of God) led to a slaughter. Hisanswer: an infinite crime requires a corresponding judgment of infiniteproportion; a punishment that would literally shake the foundations of theearth; an execution so horrific that the sun would take cover in the shadows ofdarkness. Humanity was on trial with an offended God and nothing less than aperfectly innocent victim of infinite worth being subjected to a false trial,bodily torture, and an agonizingly slow execution was deemed satisfactory toameliorate the insult of disobedience and “zero balance the books.”We have raised in these pages more than a few counter arguments to the reveredSaint Anselm; respectful but not as naïve as the defenseless Boso, for there areliterally pyramidal mountains of evidence that are not so haphazardly scatteredacross the earth and over the span of centuries if not millennia. Boso, thecurious and open minded disciple may have been finally silenced by the blood-curdling logic of Anselm of Canterbury, but how differently might he havecountered his master if he were given a chance to survey the ancient monuments,open the sacred Mayan texts, and to make a comparative study of human historywith its echoed tales of innocent victims bleeding to appease an offended allpowerful heavenly ruler? How differently might Boso have answered his master ifhe had been privileged to see into the future and gaze at the alchemical symbolsthat would adorn the great Gothic cathedrals raised only a few hundred yearslater?The logical lid to Pandora’s box has been swept off with hurricane winds ofmodern research. It is now impossible to reseal this once mysterious box with asimplistic theological “final word”; a word that was once sufficient to satisfythe medieval doubting Thomas’ minds. The 21st century winds of time, historicalinquiry, and archaeological evidence unquestionably raise a voice of doubtconcerning the credibility of Anselm’s apology. Perhaps even more disconcertingto modern unbelievers is the seemingly immoral appeal of the medievalapologist’s insistence upon a once-for-all debt and payment theology which, ashas now been shown, was hardly an isolated once-for-all incident. Carefulresearch now reveals that the debt and payment ritual espoused by Anselm waslittle more than his own preferred bloody event among many innocent bloodlettings to this or that god demanding endless sacrifices. The debt and paymentritual on the outskirts of a Jerusalem hillside in or about 33 C.E was gruesomeand historically significant, but it was undoubtedly neither the first nor thelast one made to an offended god demanding payment of a debt.If Anselm’s adversary in this dialogue were an atheist rather than his discipleit is certain that more poignant questions might have been asked, such as whywould a loving god insist on the unloving ritual of draining the blood ofvictims for the appeasing of feelings that arose from an insult? What moralvalue is actually attached to the death of an innocent substitute victim? How isinsult turned to satisfaction when the punishment seems to far outweigh theostensible crime? Is it possible that the actual lust for recompense has less todo with insult and more to do with the payment over an assumed debt far moresignificant than the insult of disobedience?Indeed, morality and innocence are hardly in play in this drama, other than inthe tear filled eyes of the onlookers and next victims. This drama, for allpractical concern, lacks any human morality; if any morality could be wrestledfrom this drama one might think they were watching an alternative version ofOscar Wilde’s Picture of Dorian Gray; the chicanery of an angry god with blooddripping from his hands, scars and wrinkled brow, clinched fists, morphing intoa loving and pure young man as all the sins of the world are infused into himrather than sins committed by him. Oddly enough, Victorian England condemnedWilde as propagating immorality in verse for a novel where the protagonist turnsfrom his lust for blood and dies remorsefully, driving death’s blade into theimage of something evil. Aztecs and Anselm, conversely, wrote the climax totheir drama with an innocent virgin dying to appease a blood thirsty god, andsomehow this makes the world a better place. In the one case, it was a twisted“spiritual economics” that set the sacrificial drama into motion; in the other,a twisted physics, and both come together in some black alchemy designed totransform man’s soul into the mindset of a perpetual slave.“The world is a stage,” stated Oscar Wilde, “but the play is badly cast.” Thestage for this tragedy is no quiet hillside nor a Victorian neo-gothic mansionwith a magical portrait inside a nursery, but rather it is a far more sinisterand unsuspecting place. This tragedy is one of debts, pure and simple. Gods witha thirst for more than moral uprightness; gods with an unquenchable need toeliminate competition; gods demanding nothing less than control over propertyand establishing ownership by threat and force. A quid pro quo played out fromstart to finish, a chilling tale of servitude and sacrifice for satisfying adebt, and manipulating the physical medium. This is the story of The Grids ofthe Gods, it is the story of human history and some of the monuments left behindon that grid as memorials!The Grid did not die; the magical and alchemical music of the spheres, and thepossible hyper-dimensional engineering with which it was engineered, did notdie. It survived in the unlikely place of western Europe, in the breathtakingGothic cathedrals, and the ambiguous, but clearly alchemical natures of thesymbolism sculpted in them. No one better understood the ambivalent nature ofthese symbols than the enigmatic “Fulcanelli,” a man as ambiguous, ambivalent,and alchemical as the symbols of the cathedrals whose esoteric and alchemicalmeanings he dared to expose. Lest we become lost in the mystery of the man,2however, we remain concentrated upon his work, or rather, upon just one of themany symbols he decodes.We have seen that there was alchemy at work in this attempt to manipulate thephysical medium through a “spiritual economics” of debt and sacrifice. But thepractice of sacrifice, alchemy, and “spiritual debt” did not die with the Aztecsand Montezuma, for one need go no further as an epilogue to this survey of theGrid than these great Gothic cathedrals, where yet another ritual of sacrificewas played out amid the backdrop of a scarcely perceived alchemical symbolism.Those great, soaring, buttressed cathedrals are, as many know, purposefully laidout on points of the Gird; what many do not know, however, are the calculateddepths of ambivalent alchemical symbolism that is employed within and throughthem.We mention only one of the many bas reliefs of Notre Dame de Paris, pointed outby Fulcanelli in his monumental study. In many ways, it is the key to his work,as it is also the key to the alchemy of the cathedrals, and the deepersymbolisms that would eventually come bursting forth in European literature andart once the necessity for disguising them behind a veneer of Christianity wasno longer necessary, and independent thought had begun to liberate itself toexamine these symbols with more objectivity.Fulcanelli was alchemy’s answer to Anselm.Or rather, he was the decoder of alchemy’s symbolism which adorned the gothiccathedrals of France.Consider the ambiguous nature of the following bas relief found in Notre Dame deParis, the first such relief and symbolism Fulcanelli discussed in his book.image [images/00112.jpg] The Ambiguous Bas Relief At Notre Dame de Paris: King of Heaven? or AndrogynousAlchemy?3 The relief is found on the Great Porch of the famous Paris cathedral.At first glance, the dictates of Christian piety will perhaps decode the reliefin a predictable way: a figure is seated on a throne, holding a scepter in theleft hand, and two books — one open, and the other closed — in the right, withthe curious figure of a ladder between the knees. This, piety will suggest, isChrist, the King of Heaven, seated on the throne of Heaven, holding open theBook of the Gospels, perhaps, and the closed Book of Life, to be opened by Himat the apocalypse. The ladder is, perhaps, a symbolism of Jacob’s ladder, bywhich heaven and earth were united, and thus a fitting symbol of Christ. It is atestimony to the skill of the symbolists that the figure can be interpreted inthis fashion.But to one schooled in esotericism, the symbol is capable of a very differentinterpretation. A closer glance at the figure reveals a carefully executedandrogyny, neither fully masculine, nor fully feminine. Or rather, it is bothfully masculine and feminine simultaneously. As such, it is equally analchemical, as well as a Christian symbol, for it thus functions as a symbol ofthe physical medium itself, as alchemy understood it. Fulcanelli writeselsewhere “The spirit cannot but feel troubled in the presence of this even moreparadoxical antithesis: the torch of alchemical thought illuminating the templeof Christian thought.”4From this vantage point, the rest of the relief decodes itself in very differentterms. Fulcanelli notes that the famous cathedral, “like most French cathedrals,is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary or the Virgin Mother.”5 However, thereis an esoteric and alchemical significance even in this, and the bas relief onthe Great Porch reveals it:> In the place of honour, facing the parvis, alchemy is represented by a woman,> with her head touching the clouds. Seated on a throne, she holds in her left> hand a sceptre, the sign of royal power, while her right hand supports two> books, one closed (esotericism) the other open (exotericism). Supported> between her knees and leaning against her chest, is the ladder with nine rungs> — scala philosophorum -hieroglyph of the patience which the faithful must> possess in the course of the nine successive operations of the hermetic> labour…6 Beyond the fact that Fulcanelli has glossed the androgynous nature of therelief, the symbol could be taken straight from Vishnu’s first “tripartation,”the primordial nothingness standing over against him after that initial“tripartation” in all its stark, undifferentiated femininity.It is, Fulcanelli observes, “the seal of the secular Great Work” of alchemy “onthe very face of the Christian Great Work.”7 This Virgin Mother depicted here is“stripped of her symbolical veil” and thus> is none other than the personification of the primitive substance, used by the> Principle, the creator of all that is, for the furtherance of his designs.> This is the meaning (and, indeed, a very clear one) of this strange epithet,> which we read in the Mass of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin, of which> the text reads: > “The Lord possessed me at the beginning of his ways. I existed before he> formed any creature. I existed from all eternity, before the earth was> created. The abysses were not yet and already I was conceived.…”8 For Fulcanelli, the bas relief was a therefore also a clue to the profoundlydifferent alchemical and esoteric meaning of familiar passages of the Bible,meanings at variance with the popular meanings ascribed to them by piety.The meaning was clear: the Virgin Mother was a symbol of that primordial mater,the primordial “mother” or matter, the physical medium from which, according toalchemy, all else derived. Small wonder, then, that alchemical symbolism shouldadorn the great cathedrals where, according to the dogmas of the mediaevalchurch, another transmutation called “transubstantiation” was performed in aritual act understood by the Church to be sacrificial, for behind the exotericdogma and ritual, a hidden esotericism was perhaps at work, biding its timebehind Christian symbols, until it could once again re-emerge as itself, andfreed from the necessity of having to disguise itself. The very fact that thesesymbols are alchemical, and boldly emblazoned on France’s most famous Gothiccathedrals, is testament to something else, namely, that an alchemical, hermeticelite continued in Europe throughout the centuries, overseeing and guiding theirconstruction.During his most recent research in Paris, as with his spine tingling pilgrimageto Chichen Itza, at least one thing was quite clearly revealed to Scott de Hart;both at Notre Dame as well as within the dark catacombs of the City of Lights,he was a witness to the ritual and alchemical march of humanity into the hiddenchambers of the gods’ playground. It is well to heed the warning for posted inthe catacombs when taking this journey:”Arrête! C’esticil’empire de la mort,”Stop! This is the empire of death.Finally, there is, as we also saw, a deeper reality to this ancient view of thephysical medium, to the view that existed before it became twisted into ritualsof spiritual debt and sacrifice, and that is the view that the medium was anoverflowing fecundity, a primordial androgynous “Nothing” from which all elseflowed. It was a primordial “divine simplicity,” an empire of life, that createda very strange set of symbols, a set of symbols we have only briefly touchedupon in these pages, and whose full range of expression and implications haveyet to be plumbed.But plumbing those depths is a task for another book. For now, this task, thissurvey, and the hints of its implications, is completed.> Joseph P.
