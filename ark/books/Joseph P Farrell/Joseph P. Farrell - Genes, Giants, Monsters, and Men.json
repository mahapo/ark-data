How does one synthesize it all? Is it even possible to speakin one breath of giants, monsters, ancient texts and evolution?Asking these questions highlights the problem, and the problem is the texts,what we mean by them, and what we think they mean.Pretty much everyone with half a brain, and who has not been lobotomized by theAmerican “education” system or subjected to the psychedelic drugs andmind-numbing electroshock of its dull university curricula, even dullerprofessors, and to its “textbooks” that contain no primary texts, is agreed thatsomething is wrong with our standard model of history, particularly the fartherback one goes. Only a university academic, for example, could believe thathumanity was around for about 150,000 years (if one is to believe thegeneticists), and doing nothing but “hunting and gathering,” and then all of asudden, and for no explicable reason, decided to invent civilizations such asSumer (and all its Mesopotamian offshoots) and Egypt out of whole cloth,undertake monumental ziggurat or pyramid construction, invent calendars,agriculture, wheels, writing, mathematics, music, astronomy, banking, and maybeeven electricity, as evidenced by the Baghdad Battery.Consequently, when it comes right down to it, we have a choice between fairytales, or, if one prefers, between mythologies or dogmas.We can believe the hypnotic incantations of biology, history, and anthropologyprofessors waving their wands, and producing cute animated videos of theprimordial soup gradually evolving into complex organic life (fish), whose finsgradually morph into limbs as they crawl out of the soup onto the sand(reptiles) and, as the computer-generated animation proceeds, gradually morphinginto a veritable cornucopia of evolutionary progress over “billions of years”(insert Carl Sagan voice here).Or we can begin to take seriously what those ancient societies — that suddenlysprang up out of whole cloth and almost ex nihilo — said happened. There thepicture is equally disconcerting, for one is almost immediately confronted bywild tales of giants, monsters, men and even — if one reads the texts a certainway — with genetic manipulation and extraterrestrials, and a cast of charactersthat range the whole spectrum from nobility to a genocidal disposition andbehavior that would make a Stalin or a Hitler seem like paragons of virtue,restraint, and compassion.Indeed, the comparison with Stalin and Hitler is an apt one, for if one readscertain ancient texts from Sumeria or India, one encounters over and over suchcharacters, whether gods or men, engaged in a titanic struggle for power thatultimately resulted in a “cosmic war,” and its aftermath. Yet, if one is tobelieve the ancient stories, the monsters and giants and manipulations remainedafter that war was over, scattering themselves along with some of the technologyby which it was fought, yet doing so with no consistency. For example, one findsboth the Sumerian Anunnaki and the Hebrew Nephilim siring chimerical andgigantic offspring with human women, and yet the context in which the story istold — Sumerian “polytheism” versus Hebrew “monotheism” — changes drastically,and implies a hidden agenda (or agendas) behind each version of the story.This book looks at things from the standpoint of the second fairy tale; that is,it assumes that a very ancient “cosmic war” was fought within our own solarsystem, by a civilization with interplanetary extent, and which was based onthis planet, the Moon, Mars, and various satellites of the gas giants. As I havedetailed elsewhere, that war was so destructive that the civilization waging itwas nearly wiped out, leaving its surviving elites to pick up the pieces as bestas they could, and begin the long, slow climb back up to a similar pitch ofscientific and technological development.1[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos620849] The course of thatwar, and its aftermath, was populated by a bizarre pantheon of gods, of giants —the chimerical offspring of the “gods” and man — and by even more chimericalmonsters, and of course, by humans. These, and the deeper implied issues of asophisticated genetic science in existence in very ancient times, constitute theobvious motifs of this book. They are the portals by which we will enter intothe central theme of this book, which is to acquire a preliminary understandingof the agendas of those elites that survived the cosmic war and catastrophe, andto trace a broad chronology of their activities.Thus, our focus is both on the elites and their agendas in the aftermath of thatwar, and with this, certain methodological assumptions are implicit. We assume,for example, that:> 1. Elites did survive, both in pockets scattered over the surface of the> earth, and possibly in pockets altogether off this planet on other celestial> bodies, wherever those might be;> 2. Like all elites, these had certain agendas, some of which it had to put> into place immediately to ensure their, and humanity’s, survival, and some of> which were of a more long-term nature, such as moving civilization by> progressive steps back to a similar pitch of technological and scientific> achievement as it had before the war. This would require a global extent to> such a civilization, and all the trappings of civilized society, including,> especially, agriculture and commerce.> > > a. For the conduct of commerce, especially, an accurate system of weights> > and measures would be required, and this would have to be of fairly> > universal extent, and one moreover that was capable of simple and accurate> > reproduction anywhere on the planet.

Similarly, as tools of cohesion, conquest, and a considerable degree of> > obfuscation, religions were promoted by the very same elites, and as> > commerce and contact between civilizations grew — often fostered by the very> > same elites — so too did religious agendas change, often violently, but just> > as often subtly.

This is not a claim or assertion that all> > religions from that postbellum period, and which claim an oracular or> > revelatory foundation, are the products of an “oracular technology,” but> > only that some of them could be.> 3. The careful reader will have noticed yet another implicit assumption, and> that is that in order for any such post-Cosmic War elites to function with> such long-range goals, they must of necessity operate not only in a> coordinated fashion, but in a fashion continuous over time and throughout> history.2 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos621124] They> will, in short, have their modern descendants, and these too will evidence> their own agendas, and while we will not often touch upon them in this book,> we will encounter them at work in the first three chapters. Tracing the> memberships and lineaments of those elites in ancient times is, of course,> next to impossible if one hopes to dig up cuneiform “lists of secret members.”> But one may approach the task by looking at the policies and practices of the> known elites of those times, and there the picture becomes very suggestive if> not completely persuasive: commerce, religion, and civilization itself were in> the hands of an astronomical-astrological priesthood — complete with all the> homosexual and heterosexual temple prostitution that accompanied it — and that> elite worked with cold calculation behind the scenes to raise up, and to> destroy, whole civilizations in pursuit of its ultimate goal: the> reestablishment of a global civilization. That goal had to be reached, if> humanity was ever to return to the stars, and reestablish contact with part of> that pre-Cosmic War humanity — its “cousins” — with whom it had lost touch.This list of implicit methodological assumptions may be summarized by a seriesof simple questions that will be touched upon in this book: why does such anagenda (or agendas) even exist, who is behind it, and what is its purpose? Whatdo the ancient stories and modern science say or imply about this agenda? Canwhat they say be harmonized? Perhaps last, but by no means least, what is theconnection between this agenda and the “cosmic war of the gods” that precededit?Such questions also highlight the technological themes of this book, for tosuggest that elites existed with an agenda to manipulate humanity en masse viagenetics, technologies, and religion, and to do so over a great period of timein order to reach a millennia-distant goal suggests at least rudimentarytechnologies and techniques had to be in place, and accordingly, we will lookfor evidence of these things in the archaeological record and the textsthemselves. Additionally, I have already assumed the existence of a Very HighCivilization that fought a cosmic interplanetary war, and even blew up a planetin our solar system, in my previous book The Cosmic War. Moreover, as I haveargued in Babylon’s Banksters, there is abundant evidence that these elites werefully international in extent, that they manipulated both finance and religionthemselves, and had a rudimentary technology of communication by which to doso.3 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos621548] The implicationsof these assertions are rather obvious, for a civilization capable of blowing upentire planets implies a technological sophistication. But such sophisticationalso implies a similar nadir of development once existed in terms of socialengineering and the technologies to manipulate man himself, that is to say, tomanipulate his mind, his brain, and his very life processes — his DNA.I assume, therefore, in the main body of this work that some of thesetechnologies, and particularly those of brain-mind manipulation, possiblysurvived for a brief period after that Cosmic War, or that they were at leastreconstructed in rudimentary form. As such, the mere existence of thepossibility of the use of such technologies in ancient times reveals not onlythe possible agendas of those elites, but also raises the vexing possibilitythat the great “revelations,” beginning with Abram/Abraham and Moses, and thereligions founded upon them, were nothing but the productions of a technology,and to serve an agenda more or less hidden from those being manipulated. As willbe seen in the main body of this work, the reading of ancient texts in the lightof modern technology inevitably poses a significant problem for religiousapologetics of the revealed religions. The task of this book, however, lies notin apologetics, but in synoptics; the task is not to solve the apologeticdilemma but as thoroughly as possible to pose the questions and the problems.4[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos621851]These types of questions throw open the whole notion of what a “text” is, andhow it might be interpreted. As I wrote in the predecessor to this book, TheCosmic War:> Careful consideration of the questions outlined above, and of the parameters> of the “interplanetary war scenario” itself, will also reveal the types of> evidence to be considered...: (1) physics, (2) the material evidences of> anomalous artifacts, (3) evidences and mechanisms of planetary destruction,> and finally, and by no means the least important, (5) textual and “legendary”> evidence from texts, oral myths and traditions, and physical monuments and> ancient glyphs. “Text” in other words is understood in this book in the> broadest sense, as being inclusive of all these things.5> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos622289] Our focus in this book is obviously on the last of these five points, on boththe “text” in the proper sense of actual written artifacts, oral myths andtraditions, and upon the physical monuments themselves, and upon how they mightilluminate those hidden agendas and their purposes.But now a new consideration enters the picture, and that is the meaning of“monument” or “artifact” within the context of the above methodologicalassumptions about “texts,” for it will be evident upon a little consideration,that DNA itself is a monument, an artifact, a text that can be decoded via thedecryption techniques of modern genetics. This step, once embarked upon, yieldscurious anomalies of its own, for it leads to even deeper connections to other,more occulted traditions and texts; it also leads to deep connections betweenthe physics of those anomalous monuments, the manipulations of DNA recorded inthose ancient stories, and the texts themselves. There are, so to speak, “codes”within the “code,” and some of these codes were perhaps known in very ancienttimes, a relic, a legacy of that sophisticated scientific culture that blewitself apart. There is, as we shall see, a suggestive and direct link betweenhuman DNA and the physical medium itself, and it comes from an unsuspected timeand place.As such, this book, like all my books on ancient lore, esoteric doctrine, andscience, is a book of high speculation. It is argued speculation, to be sure,but it remains speculation nonetheless. In this case, however, there is anadditional factor, and that is its cursory nature, for to explore any one of thetopics outlined herein in any fashion even close to thorough would require abook for each topic. Consequently, this book is but synoptic panoramic overview.It is an exploratory essay on how such post-Cosmic War matters might profitablybe viewed; it is therefore perforce not a dissertation on all possible ways toview it.

Sanderson6 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos622581] ROBERT KOLDEWEY, famous German architect and “amateur” archaeologist, faced aproblem. A big problem. In the intellectual world of the nineteenth century, themyth that all ancient myths were nothing but myths was quickly collapsing. VonSchliemann would prove that ancient Troy, far from being a figment of Homer’soveractive and quite epic Hellenic imagination, actually existed, for he was theone who, using clues from Homer’s “myth,” actually dug it up. Whoops. Sorry,academia. Wrong again.Koldewey also entered this typically German quest to verify the reality ofancient myths not only by unearthing Babylon from her sandy tomb, but the actualfabled “hanging gardens,”7[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos622795] one of the sevenwonders of the ancient world, and the equally impressive Ishtar Gate of Babylon.He was one of the principal architects, in fact, of what would become somethingof an archaeological obsession with the region for the Germans, and they’ve beenthere ever since, scratching in the sands of Mesopotamia for clues to the actualhistory of mankind. And that was the problem, for the deeper they dug, thestranger that picture became. And in Koldewey’s case, the problem was even moreacute, for the problem was a picture.The problem was a picture, or to be more precise, the ideas he was entertainingabout that picture, for it was one thing to maintain Troy and Babylon reallyexisted, but this? Could it be? And if so, what would the academic world think?Had he been under the desert sun too long? Had he a touch of Wahnsinn? Was heperhaps ein bisschen Verrükt? He surely must have wondered those things himself,given the thoughts he was conceiving, not to mention the fact that he wasactually thinking about publishing those thoughts. But the insanity of World WarI still raged... perhaps no one would notice (until it was too late) if he justsnuck a most unorthodox, nonacademic “idea” into an otherwise serious scholarlyand archaeological study. After all, he needn’t comment on its implications,which were many and profound. He could leave commentary to others. All he had todo was “sneak it in,” point the way, hint at those wide and profoundimplications.And that’s exactly what he did in a book published in Leipzig in 1918.The book was innocently entitled Das Ischtar-Tor in Babylon, The Ishtar Gate inBabylon. And like the Ishtar Gate itself, Koldewey’s book will be our gate intoa very epic, and very Babylonian, problem."},{"pageContent":"A. KOLDEWEY’S CONUNDRUM: THE SIRRUSH The picture, or rather, bas-relief, that was causing the good Professor Koldeweysuch grief was this, the middle animal on either side of the Ishtar Gate ofBabylon, the reconstruction of which is shown below:006 [images/00006.jpg]The Reconstructed Ishtar Gate of Babylon And a close-up of the left side will reveal the problem:007 [images/00007.jpg]Close-up of the Ishtar Gate Animal Reliefs Note the top and bottom reliefs, like so many other reliefs in Babylonian andAssyrian artwork, are of fairly conventional-looking cattle or other veryordinary animals. But these were not Professor Koldewey’s problem. The problemis the middle relief, appearing as it does between two very normal-lookingbulls.A closer look at that middle relief is in order:008 [images/00008.jpg]The Creature from Babylon: The Sirrush While the head of this creature — whatever it is — is obscured somewhat in thephoto, the feet alone should tell us, as they told Koldewey, that “we have aproblem,” for the front “paws” look somewhat like the paws of a large feline,while the rear “claws” look everything like the claws of some gigantic bird.As if that were not enough, there is a long “spiraling” tail...009 [images/00009.jpg]Spiraling Tail of “the Creature from Babylon” ...a long thin body that appears to be feathered or scaled...010 [images/00010.jpg]The Long Scaled or Feathered Body of “the Creature from Babylon” ...and topping it all off was the head of a dragon or serpent of some sort:011 [images/00011.jpg]Dragon’s Head of “the Creature from Babylon” However, the problem for Koldewey (and everyone else since, as we shall seeshortly) was not that the Babylonians had given full freedom to their artisticflights of fancy; the problem was that they apparently had not, for thecreature, known as a “Sirrush,” appeared right in the middle of other creaturesknown as aurochs that were self-evidently real, and though they are now extinctas well, they were not extinct in Babylonian times. The problem was the veryreal context in which the otherwise fantastic and bizarre “Sirrush” appeared.But that wasn’t the only problem.Koldewey wrote:> A creation of another, essentially different type confronts us in the> “dragon.” This is the sirrush of legend, or as it is often referred to today,> the Mus-rushu, which Delitzsch renders as “splendid serpent.”> The slender body, the wavy-lined tail, the similarly steep, solemn slender> neck with its small scale-covered head... stands out better in color> reproduction. The scaly attire shows itself on the hind legs downward to the> middle of the shins. One observes larger diagonal scales on the abdomen. The> forelegs resemble those of a long-legged type of cat, perhaps a panther. The> hind feet are those of a bird of prey.... On the end of the tail one can> observe a curved quill, as in a scorpion. The head is entirely that of a snake> with a closed mouth from which a forked tongue protrudes. It also bears a> large upright, prominent horn from which an appendage spirals or curls out....> Behind the “whiskers” a tuft of three locks of hair falls, pictured as three> long spiraling locks....> This strange animal, with the above-enumerated features, as per Jastrow’s> picture portfolio of the religion of Babylon and Assyria, was found in the> oldest Babylonian art and preserved these features unchanged for millennia.> Thus one may not say that it is a fantastic production, a chimerical picture> of Babylonian-Assyrian art.8> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos623095] In other words, one had a creature with the forelegs of a great cat, the hindlegs of a bird, with a curving tail with what appeared to be a scorpion’s sting,a long scaly body, a snake’s head, out of which grew a horn! And this creatureappeared in the artwork of the region with amazing consistency through themillennia, and in the context of other very real creatures, one of which was thenow-extinct aurochs (about which more in a moment). It could not be, Koldeweyconcluded, merely the chimerical production of a fevered Mesopotamian artisticimagination, for in cases where such mythological creatures were encountered inBabylonian art, these showed a great deal of change over time; the sirrush didnot.Koldewey attempted to rationalize the creature’s strange appearance by variouscomparisons to the features of known dinosaurs, and concluded, somewhat lessthan convincingly, that “When one finds a picture such as our sirrush in nature,one must reckon it as belonging to the order of dinosaurs and indeed of thesub-order of ornithopods.”9[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos625585] However, one would behard-pressed to find dinosaurs with the forelegs of a cat, the hind legs ofbirds of prey, with spiraling tails and scorpion’s quills, and snake’s headsgrowing horns, all in one fantastic creature. Koldewey proposed one dinosaur,the iguanodon, which did indeed have hind feet similar to a bird, as being aclose match to the sirrush.10[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos625757] But that does notreally make the dilemma any more palatable, since that would mean that longafter dinosaurs were supposed to be extinct according to standard evolutionarytheory, the ancient Babylonians were depicting them in the clear context ofother very real, and very living, creatures, the aurochs.To make matters very much worse, it even appeared to Koldewey that the sirrushmight have been the basis behind at least one biblical story, that recounted inthe Greek versions of the book of Daniel, and known as Bel and the Dragon:> And in that same place there was a great dragon, which they of Babylon> worshipped. And the king said unto Daniel, Wilt thou also say that this is of> brass? lo, he liveth, he eateth and drinketh; thou canst not say that he is no> loving god: therefore worship him.11> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos625905] In the story, Daniel kills the dragon by poisoning it. But the sirrush and theproblems it posed could not be gotten rid of so easily, for there it was, boldlyemblazoned on the enameled bricks of the Ishtar Gate which Koldewey himself hadunearthed.The renowned naturalist Ivan T. Sanderson summed up Koldewey’s conundrum thisway:> (Despite) his solid Teutonic background, Professor Koldewey became more and> more convinced that it was not a representation of a mythical creature but an> attempt to depict a real animal, an example of which had actually been kept> alive in Babylon in very early days by the priests.

DELITZSCH’S DILEMMA: BABEL UND BIBEL Friedrich Delitzsch (1850–1922) was a noted German Assyriologist who had thedistinction of having caused an international firestorm of controversy that ittook no less than the efforts of Kaiser Wilhelm II, acting in his capacity asthe chief bishop of the German Lutheran Church, to stamp out.The controversy began innocently enough.The Cambridge scholar C.H.W. Johns, in his 1903 “Introduction” to Delitzsch’slectures, summarized its rather innocent beginnings in the following way:> The announcement that Professor Friedrich Delitzsch, the great Assyriologist,> had been granted leave to deliver a lecture upon the relations between the> Bible and the recent results of cuneiform research, in the august presence of> the Kaiser and the Court, naturally caused a great sensation; in Germany> first, and, as a wider circle, wherever men feel interest in the progress of> Science. The lecture was duly delivered on the 13th of January 1902, and> repeated on the 1st of February.> Some reports of the general tenour of the discourse reached the outside world,> and it was evident that matters of the greatest interest were involved. In due> course appeared a small book with the text of the lecture, adorned with a> number of striking pictures of the ancient monuments. This was the now> celebrated Babel und Bibel. 13> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos626342]> The title was a neat one, emphasizing the close relation between the results> of cuneiform studies and the more familiar facts of the Bible.14> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos626511] One may easily imagine the scene: the Kaiser resplendent in his uniform, hismarshals and ministers surrounding him, sitting in ornamented chairs, listeningto the distinguished professor elaborating his discoveries and conclusions.But then, according to Johns, events took a decidedly strange turn. Indeed, “itcame, therefore, as a shock of surprise to find that rejoinders were beingissued.” That wasn’t all:> A rapid succession of articles, reviews, and replies appeared in newspapers> and magazines, and a whole crowd of pamphlets and books. These regarded the> lecture from many varied points of view, mostly with disapproval. The> champions of the older learnings assailed it from all sides. Even those who> had been forward to admit nothing but a human side to the history and> literature of Israel were eager to fall on the new pretender to public favour;> and, to the astonishment of many, these arose a literature zum Streit um Babel> und Bibel.> As the echoes of this conflict reached our ears, we seemed to gather that the> higher critics, usually known for their destructive habits, were now engaged> in defending, in some way, the Bible against the attacks of an archaeologist> and cuneiform scholar. This seemed a reversal of the order of nature. We had> been used to regard the archaeologist, especially the Assyriologist, as one> who had rescued much of the Bible history from the scepticism of literary> critics.15 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos626771] But then, to make matters even worse, Delitzsch was invited to deliver yetanother lecture in the presence of Kaiser Wilhelm and his court.014 [images/00014.jpg]Kaiser Wilhelm II von Hohenzollern And that was when the “cuneiform hell” broke loose, requiring the Kaiser’spersonal imperial intervention to quiet the controversy:> But now reports of a very disquieting nature reached us.

We could not afford to remain longer in ignorance of what had stirred> our allies so profoundly.16> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos627012] Just exactly what had Delitzsch said to the Kaiser and his court, and why did ithave everyone from “bible believer” to “higher critical skeptic” so exercisedthat it required a letter from the Kaiser himself, in his capacity as “highestbishop” in the Lutheran Church, to quell?If one glances at the short biographical sketch of Delitzsch in the onlineencyclopedia Wikipedia, one begins to have some approximation:> Friedrich Delitzsch specialized in the study of ancient Middle Eastern> languages, and published numerous works on Assyrian language, history and> culture. He is remembered today for his scholarly critique of the Biblical Old> Testament. In a 1902 controversial lecture titled “Babel and Bible,” Delitzsch> maintained that many Old Testament writings were borrowed from ancient> Babylonian tales, including the stories of Creation and the Great Flood.> During the following years there were several translations and modified> versions of the “Babel and Bible.” In the early 1920s, Delitzsch published the> two-part Die große Täuschung (The Great Deception), which was a critical> treatise on the book of Psalms, prophets of the Old Testament, the invasion of> Canaan, etc. Delitzsch also stridently questioned the historical accuracy of> the Hebrew Bible and placed great emphasis on its numerous examples of> immorality. ...17 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos627162] Clearly, Delitzsch’s program was a total one, as his work entitled The GreatDeception implies, but that program was first enunciated in his lectures beforethe Kaiser and his court, the lectures which eventually became Babel and Bible.Delitzsch himself put the matter this way at the very beginning of his firstlecture:> What is the object of these labours in distant, inhospitable, and dangerous> lands? To what end this costly work of rummaging in mounds many thousand years> old, of digging deep down into the earth in places where no gold or silver is> to be found? Why this rivalry among nations for the purpose of securing, each> for itself, these desolate hills — and the more the better — in which to> excavate? And from what source, on the other hand, is derived the> self-sacrificing interest, ever on the increase, that is shewn on both sides> of the ocean, in the excavations in Babylonia and Assyria?> To either question there is one answer, which, if not exhaustive, nevertheless> to a great extent tells us the cause and aim: it is the Bible.18> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos627400] Observe carefully both what Delitzsch has implied, and what he has actually saidhere.First, Delitzsch has implied that the excavations in Mesopotamia had a directbearing on our understanding of the origins of our Judeo-Christian civilizationand, to a lesser extent, the civilization of the Islamic world as well. Butsecondly, and more importantly, he has explicitly stated that the control ofsuch excavation sites was a matter of great power rivalry, since it wasprecisely those nations that were aiming to control such sites across the MiddleEast, and that implies that there might be a hidden agenda at work behind theseemingly innocent purposes of archaeological digging. Just what that agenda maybe will become more and more evident in a moment.Delitzsch interlarded the actual published version of his lectures with a numberof pictures that clearly pointed to some deep Babylonian-Assyrian-Sumerianorigin or influence upon much of the stories of the Old Testament:> May we point to an old Babylonian cylinder-seal? Here, in the middle, is the> tree with hanging fruit; on the right the man, to be recognized by the horns,> the symbol of strength, on the left the woman; both reaching out their hands> to the fruit, and behind the woman the serpent. Should there not be a> connection between this old Babylonian representation and the Biblical story> of the Fall?19 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos627644] He then reproduces this depiction of the impression of the cylinder-seal:015 [images/00015.jpg]Babylonian Cylinder-Seal Depiction of the Fall of Man20[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos627829] There were other suggestive artistic parallels between popular Christian imageryand ancient Babylonian and Assyrian art. For example, there was a depiction ofAssyrian king Ashurbanipal slaying a lion, all too eerily similar to depictionsof St. George slaying the dragon:016 [images/00016.jpg]King Ashurbanipal Slaying a Lion21[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos627968] The theme was repeated, in a different guise, with the god Ninurta/Mardukwielding powerful thunderbolts to slay a chimerical “dragon”:017 [images/00017.jpg]Ninurta/Marduk Slaying the Dragon with Thunderbolts22[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos628115] Delitzsch’s commentary is worth citing:> It is interesting to note that there is still an echo of this contest between> Marduk and Tiamat in the Apocalypse of John, where we read of a conflict> between the Archangel Michael and the “Beast of the Abyss, the Old Serpent,> which is the Devil and Satan.” The whole conception, also present in the story> of the knight St. George and his conflict with the dragon, a story brought> back by the Crusaders, is manifestly Babylonian.23> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos628507] As I have argued elsewhere, the struggle between Marduk and Tiamat mightactually be the dimly recollected memories of an actual cosmic, orinterplanetary, war fought in very ancient times with extraordinarytechnologies.24 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos628654] InDelitzsch’s time, with the discoveries of Nikola Tesla and other inventorsalready transforming the world, it would have been an easy step for the elitesof those great powers to read the ancient Sumerian, Babylonian, and Assyriantexts, and to conclude that they contained hints of a lost technology of vastpower, and hence, one has one explanation for the possible hidden motivations ofthe scramble those nations showed to control the various archaeological sites.25[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos628925]"},{"pageContent":"1. THE CUNEIFORM TABLETS AND AN OUT-OF-PLACE NAME FOR GOD But by far the most sensational piece of evidence and commentary that Delitzschproduced in his lecture was a set of cuneiform tablets.> What is there to be seen on these tablets?

In short, there was nothing special about the name “Yahweh,” or “Iave.”"},{"pageContent":"2. THE DOCUMENTARY HYPOTHESIS: ASTRUC TO DEWETTE One may get a sense of the enormous implications of Delitzsch’s discovery — atleast for the biblical literalists of the period — by posing an obviousquestion: what was a supposedly uniquely Hebrew proper name for God doing incuneiform texts manifestly much older than the book of Exodus, and in a veryun-Hebrew, very Sumerian context?But what of the problems it posed to the literary higher critics? Why did theytake umbrage at Delitzsch’s cuneiform tablets? To answer that question requiresa short excursion into a critical theory called “the Documentary Hypothesis,” oras it is also sometimes known, the “Graf-Wellhausen Hypothesis” or the “JEDPtheory. In its recognizable modern form, this theory holds that the first fivebooks of the Old Testament — the “Pentateuch” or “Torah” — were composed fromdifferent underlying documentary “sources” indicated by the four letters J, E,D, and P. The theory began in Enlightenment France with the observations of theFrench physician Jean Astruc.Astruc noticed that in the Hebrew text of the first two chapters of the Book ofGenesis, each chapter referred to God by a different name, Elohim 020[images/00020.jpg] translated “God” in the Authorized version, was the name usedin chapter one, and Yahweh 021 [images/00021.jpg] translated “LORD” (in allcapitals) in the Authorized version in chapter two. In order to account for thisdifference, Astruc reasoned that Moses, when composing the “creation accounts”(which he assumed both chapters represented), had in fact utilized twoindependent sources, or “documents.”30[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos630097] In so arguing, heprovided the metaphysical and philological first principle that would guidesubsequent scholarship to elaborate the fully fledged Documentary Hypothesis:different Divine Names indicate the presence in the extant text of differentunderlying source material for that text.By 1853, nearly a century later, the German critic Herman Hupfeld would extendthis principle to its logical conclusion: differences within passages of overallstyle or vocabulary constituted a sufficient basis upon which to posit differentunderlying documentary sources from which those stylistic differences derive.With “the Astruc Principle” and the “Hupfeld Corollary,” a critical agenda ofits own was emplaced and empowered, for now the various names of God could come,with a certain brazen and nominalistic elegance, to stand for somethingcompletely mundane rather than for some characteristic metaphysical property ofGod; they came, within the historical phenomenology of the hypothesis itself, tostand only for the source documents from which the final extant text was allegedto derive. The divine names, so to speak, were only the revelations ofno-longer-extant source documents, which were the task of critical scholarshipto discern and disentangle. And the Germans, more than anyone else, were theones most busily engaged in this process.It is worth pausing to consider the implications of all of this as possiblemanifestations of yet another agenda. By empowering the critic himself, with allhis specialized tools of knowledge of the original languages, philology, andother ancient texts, a complete end run was done around existing ecclesiasticalmagisteria and doctrines, and additionally, the entirety of the Old Testamentcame to be viewed within such circles as the special creation over centuries ofthe Hebrew priesthood and elite, with the occasional bow to Egyptian origins formuch of it.31 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos630469]In any case, once the first two chapters of Genesis had been subjected to the“Astruc Principle” and the “Hupfeld Corollary,” there was nothing logically toprevent their application to other passages of the Torah.32[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos630939] Indeed, it was JohannGottfried Eichhorn who first extended Astruc’s criterion of the divine names asindicating separate source documents to the remainder of the book of Genesis andon into the first two chapters of the book of Exodus, in his Introduction to theOld Testament, published in Germany between 1780 and 1783. This work earned himhis lasting epithet as being the “father of Old Testament criticism.”33[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos631202] What was new withEichhorn was the coupling of Astruc’s philological principle with the newassumption that Moses had not authored any of the Torah or “Five Books ofMoses.” In other words, it was Eichhorn who in fact accomplished the empowermentof the critical scholar and the accompanying agenda, for if Moses did not authorthose books, and they were, on the contrary, the editorial compilation fromsources made over time, then it followed that a massive task of historicalreinterpretation and reconstruction would have to be undertaken. In Eichhorn’scase, the “ancient agenda” at work in the text was simple: he maintained thatthe ancient Hebrew theology had evolved or developed from a primitive polytheismto an advanced personal monotheism, an evolution that in turn implied apost-Mosaic date for the emergence of the Torah in its final textual form.Once the Torah was no longer the work of “Moses,” or, to put it differently, oneauthor, the way was then clear for critics to question the compositional, andtherefore, the metaphysical and moral unity and integrity of the Torah. Indeed,as the elaboration of the Documentary Hypothesis proceeded throughout the lateeighteenth century and all throughout the nineteenth, as the presupposition ofunitary authorship collapsed, the discovery of textual, moral, and metaphysicalcontradictions within it grew in inverse proportion. With Eichhorn, then, wehave Astruc’s division of two “sources,” the J or Jahwist source, and the E orElohist source, extended to the entirety of the book of Genesis and on intoExodus chapters one and two.One of the first to pursue the implications of Eichhorn’s abandonment of Mosaicauthorship was Wilhelm M.L. DeWette in the first half of the nineteenth century.He maintained that the Book of the Law which was discovered in 621 B.C. duringKing Josiah’s reign, as recounted in II Kings 22, was in fact the book ofDeuteronomy. DeWette argued that, since King Josiah and the high priest Hilkaiahwere concerned to abolish localized sanctuaries and places of sacrifice and tocentralize worship in the Jerusalem Temple, then, so his argument ran, the bookwhich was “discovered” had in fact been deliberately composed for that purposeby an agent of the Temple, and its discovery was staged at the appropriatemoment. For DeWette, the whole production, in other words, was in the service ofa hidden agenda, namely, to centralize worship, thus solidifying the kingdom,and enriching the royal and temple treasuries. Readers of my previous book,Babylon’s Banksters, will recall that it was precisely in alliance with ancienttemples that the ancient banking fraternity often hid its own agendas.34[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos631399] But as we shall seein chapter three, there are possibly even more hidden, technological agendas atwork in this maneuver. In any case, this pinpointed the date of the book ofDeuteronomy to 621 B.C.35[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos631631] With DeWette’s“discovery,” the third document, D for the “deuteronomist” document, had beenfound. We now have J, E, and D."},{"pageContent":"3. THE DOCUMENTARY HYPOTHESIS: HUPFELD’S “COPERNICAN REVOLUTION” With the work Die Quellen der Genesis (The Sources of Genesis) by theaforementioned Herman Hupfeld in 1853, the “Copernican revolution” in thehistory of the Documentary Hypothesis occurred.36[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos632040] His contribution tothe evolution of the hypothesis were three new principles of examination of theTorah, and a newly discovered source document, so it is worth taking some timeto examine Hupfeld in closer detail.The first component in Hupfeld’s “Copernican revolution” was that, by subjectingthe previously isolated “E” document to a new philological examination, hediscovered there were portions of “E” which, with the exception of the divinename “Elohim” itself, otherwise greatly resembled the “J” document in diction,style, and thematic focus. Thus, there were some portions of “E” which, in thehistorical scheme of the emerging hypothesis, appeared to be material as earlyas that of “J.” Hupfeld was obliged, therefore, to separate “E” into two furtherdocuments, an earlier “E” that resembles “J,” which he called “E1, and the restof “E” which became “E2,” or more simply, the original “E.” There were now fourdocuments, displaying more or less the following chronological order: E1EJD. Itwas this E1 that became the later “priestly” or “P” document, and it willhenceforth be referred to as such. With this change in symbols, the order ofdocuments now reads PEJD.As if this were not already confusing enough, to this apparatus Hupfeld added asecond, and perhaps the most important, principle in the arsenal ofpresuppositions of Old Testament criticism, for he maintained that the documentsthus distinguished by the criteria of different vocabulary, diction, andinterest had integrity; that is, they could not only be distinguished within theextant text of the Torah, but actually recovered and reconstructed as separatedocuments from that text. The text, in short, could be rewritten. (Talk aboutagendas!) This assumption was posited no doubt out of the perceived need on thepart of Old Testament criticism to justify its increasingly radicalreconstructions of early Hebrew history with a measure of “scientific”verifiability.Thirdly, Hupfeld posited the existence of an “editor,” or Redaktor, designatedas “R” in the growing non-propositional calculus of the critic, an “R who editedthe portions of the text in “E” which resembled “J” which, according to thetheory, should have belonged in “J” to begin with, except for the fact of thepresence of the name Elohim and not Yahweh! If this is not confusing enough, itcan be restated to make the confusion even more explicit: “R” lay behind theconflation of “P” and “E2” into “E.” This “R” was therefore truly a godsend, aliteral Redaktor ex machina, for “whenever the theory ran into trouble with thefacts or ran counter to the actual data of the text itself, the bungling had ofR (the anonymous redactor) was brought in to save the situation.”37[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos632246] This assumption ofthe redactor indicates the dialectical impasse into which the theory was quicklycoming, for the discovery of “P” contradicted Hupfeld’s own assumption of theintegrity and recoverability of the source documents; for if “P” which soclosely resembled “J” in diction could only be posited by positing a redactor —who is introduced precisely in order to account for the resemblances between the“documents” — then the integrity of the source documents collapses, for thatintegrity is dependent upon the differences in style and vocabulary to beginwith! In other words, Hupfeld’s redactor fills precisely the same function as anauthor utilizing sources, which is where the theory began."},{"pageContent":"4. THE DOCUMENTARY HYPOTHESIS: KARL HEINRICH GRAF AND JULIUS WELLHAUSEN The ultimate reductio was reached in the work of Karl Heinrich Graf in 1866. AsHupfeld had divided “E” into “P” and “E,” Graf in turn distinguished within Pbetween two further sources. He claimed to have discovered material in “P” whichcould only have been written after the deuteronomic legislation allegedlydiscovered by King Josiah in 621 B.C. Thus, there was some “P” that could onlyhave come from a period later than “D.” However, there was also historicalmaterial in “P” that could only have come from a period earlier than “D.” Thus,P (Hupfeld’s E1) became “P1” and “P2.” Thus, the chronological order fromearliest to latest layers of source documents was P1 (the really old P), E, J,D, and P2 (the legalistic or priestly P).Graf’s separation of “P” into two different sources of “P” was not to endure. In1869 the Dutch critic Abraham Keunen argued that P was a unified source, becausethe legal and legislative portions could not be separated from the historicalones without resulting in complete confusion, since the proper understanding ofthe one required the other. But, since Graf had fairly well established that thepriestly legislation occurred after the Babylonian Exile, the entire P documenthad to have been composed after the discovery of “D” in 621. This was a “gentlecritical way” of saying that most of the laws in the Torah were really theproduct of a post-Exilic priesthood. It was a gentle way of saying that, ratherthan those laws being the basis for Talmudic Judaism, the reverse was true;Talmudic Judaism was the basis of those Torah laws. It was a gentle way ofstating that the Torah had been composed as the result of an agenda by an elite,an elite that was, in its turn, continuous within Hebrew society throughoutseveral centuries.In any case, with Graf’s overturning of the separation of P and its redating toa period after D, only one final component needed to be added, and that was thecomponent that the J document was the product of the Hebrews when theyworshipped their local tribal god, Yahweh, and thus, the order of documents cameinto its now standardized chronological order: JEDP. It was this order thatJulius Wellhausen gave in his massive reconstruction of ancient Hebrew historyin his now classic work on the subject, Introduction to the History of Israel."},{"pageContent":"5. THE CRITICAL SUSPICION OF AN AGENDA To put it succinctly, and regardless of its many problems, the higher criticswho elaborated the Documentary Hypothesis were perhaps correct on one thing:they suspected that behind the biblical stories and the pious reasons advancedin them for various events, that there lay a hidden agenda of a hidden elite,manifesting itself, ever so faintly to be sure, in the philological and thematicdifferences between various passages. For these critics, many of whom had ceasedto believe in any sort of God, criticism and the suspicion of “an agenda” atwork in the texts became a way that they could plausibly read those texts andretain them in the canon of Western culture. If one accepts for the sake ofargument that this is true, then perhaps they were too oblivious to theimplications of their own insight, for such unity as the Torah had came not froman individual author nor even from the clumsy — yet “infallible” — hand of theRedaktor ex machina, but from the enduring influence and extent within ancienttimes of a surviving post-cosmic war elite."},{"pageContent":"6. THE SUGGESTIONS OF AN AGENDA AT WORK WITH THE CRITICS: WEISHAUPT’S STRANGECOMMENT AND A HIDDEN ILLUMINIST ROLE IN EARLY OLD TESTAMENT CRITICISM? The critics might have looked closer to home for the possible work of an agendain their own midst, in addition to one behind the texts they were scrutinizing,and that possible agenda may be pointed out by noting that higher criticism ofthe Old Testament, particularly in the hands of an Eichhorn, began in southernGermany in the eighteenth century, a time, and place, rife with what wouldbecome a by-word for conspiracies and agendas: the Illuminated Freemasonry ofUniversity of Ingolstadt professor of Canon Law, Adam Weishaupt, better known asthe founder of the Bavarian Illuminati.However, there do exist serious grounds for considering a possible relationshipbetween the two. Both Masonry and criticism at that time shared a basicpresupposition with respect to the Pentateuch, namely, that the ancient historyof man and of Israel as recorded there was at best an allegorical compilationfrom other, earlier traditions, traditions either deliberately omitted orobscured by the extant biblical text.More importantly, it was the stated goal of Adam Weishaupt and his Illuminati“to acquire the direction of education — of church management — of theprofessorial chair, and of the pulpit” and to “gain over the reviewers andjournalists” in order to spread Illuminist opinions, and thus it would seemhighly likely that biblical studies would have been a principal target for thisagenda.Even more importantly, Weishaupt himself refers once, in the writings capturedby the Bavarian government, to his own “history of the lives of the Patriarchs”which, though apparently no longer extant, does indicate his own deep interestin biblical studies, and knowing Weishaupt’s predilections, we may easily guessthat this history was hardly in line either with Catholic or Lutheran orthodoxyof the period.The Illuminati did indeed make great strides in the recruitment of prominentclergy for the day. Captured Illuminist writings list as members of the orderone “Baader, professor”, one “Barhdt, clergyman”, and a “Danzer, canon”, whomost likely are Franz Xavier von Baader (1765–1841), Karl Friedrich Barhdt(1741–1792), professor of biblical archaeology at Erfurt, and Jacob Danzer(1743–1796), professor of moral and pastoral theology at Salzburg, a haven ofIlluminati activities.38[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos632452]But perhaps most importantly, Weishaupt boasts in one of his letters, “Who wouldhave thought that a Professor at Ingolstadt was to become the teacher of theprofessor of Goettingen, and of the greatest men in Germany?” Goettingen, at thetime that Weishaupt wrote his letter, was home to Old Testament professorMichaelis, and his more celebrated pupil, Eichhorn."},{"pageContent":"7. THE EXPLOSIVE THUNDERCLAP OF DELITZSCH’S DILEMMA So, why was “Delitzsch’s Distinctive Dilemma” such an explosive thunderclap thatits echoes reverberate down to our own times in obscure scholarly debates?

But there was a further implication:> 3) The presence of such names in very old cuneiform tablets also implied that> the biblical text was indeed edited, but in a very different way, and for a> very different purpose, than that proposed by the higher critics advocating> the Documentary Hypothesis. Indeed, as Delitzsch himself pointed out, the> presence of “Cosmic War” and “Fall of Man” themes in Babylonian art, themes> paralleled in the biblical stories, suggested that the editing was wholesale> and present throughout the region’s texts and artwork. It suggested, in other> words, that there was an agenda at work throughout all texts from the region —> biblical or otherwise — and that to learn what that story and agenda was, one> would have to reconstruct that history by a careful critical process. When we put these considerations into the implications of Koldewey’s musings onthe sirrush, we get an even further expanded list of implications, for not onlyare biblical history and the wider history of religion and culture affected, sotoo, and by the same token, is the history of science and technology itself.This implies that the “agenda” referred to previously, the agenda at work in thecareful editing of texts, may be trying to hide something about four things:God, man, religion, and science itself.Koldewey’s sirrush with its odd and bizarre mixture of serpentine,ornithological, and feline characteristics points the way, for with the modernscience of genetics, the creation of such chimerical creatures looms as an evermore feasible reality, a reality that the ancient texts from Mesopotamia alsoimplied once existed, and even implied the use and manipulation of a technologyto achieve it. Could it all have been an agenda of massive misdirection, a caseof sleight-of-hand designed to get the vast majority of mankind lookingelsewhere, while an informed elite, looking at ancient texts and seeing a lostscience and technology, was really digging and scratching in the desert sands inan attempt to recover and redeploy that lost technology?That possibility informs the rest of this book, and to it, we now turn."},{"pageContent":"Two MARDUK MEASURED THE STRUCTURE OF THE DEEP: MEGALITHIC MEASURES AND THE SUMERIAN “REFORM” 022 [images/00022.jpg]> “And [Marduk] measured the structure of the deep.”— Enuma Elish, Tablet 439[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos632681] > > > > “In reality there are no mainstream measuring systems in common use today that> fail to owe a debt to the original, integrated megalithic system.”— Christopher Knight and Alan Butler40[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos632912] IF ONE IS TO BELIEVE the ancient Babylonian “cosmic war” epic, the EnumaElish,41 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos633192] then almostimmediately upon the conclusion of that war, Marduk, the victor over the evilvillain Tiamat, set out to “measure the structure of the deep.” The mind’salmost subconscious reaction to this bit of information is to chuckle and writethe statement off as yet more proof that the Enuma Elish is nothing but a bit ofancient Mesopotamian science fiction imagination run amok, with no basis in therealities of the necessities of a postwar “cleanup” of the rubble.Nothing, however, could be further from the truth.Before proceeding to uncover that “truth,” however, it is necessary to reiteratethree of the assumptions being made in this book that bear directly on ourexamination of the subject matter of this chapter.Firstly, we have assumed that an “elite” survived that war, scattered throughoutvarious places on planet Earth, and possibly elsewhere in local space. Secondly,we have assumed that those elites had agendas, both open and hidden, and thatamong the open ones were the quickest possible reestablishment of the basicnecessities of civilization and the quickest possible global extension of them.Given the devastation caused by that ancient “cosmic war,” however, this goalnecessarily had to operate over centuries and millennia of painstaking effort.Such an effort and long-range goal thus required that these surviving elites hadto organize themselves — and their knowledge — in such a fashion to be able topreserve that goal and the knowledge base even if the foundations of thatknowledge were lost in the short term. This in turn required what I havereferred to as the creation of a “unified intention of symbol,” by which mythsand stories were created to encode and preserve that science, technology, andhistory in multi-layered, complex imagery and symbols that would be decodableonce mankind had reached a similar pitch of scientific and social development ashad been the case in the prewar civilization.42[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos633655] The possible hiddenagendas have already been alluded to in the previous chapter, for “Koldewey’sConundrum” and “Delitzsch’s Dilemma” point to the possible hidden manipulationsof surviving technologies, and very possibly of religion itself, as some of themeans to accomplish this long-term goal.Thus we arrive at the third and final component of the assumptions that beardirectly on this chapter, and that is that some fragments of the technology andscientific knowledge, howsoever rudimentary, survived that ancient cosmic warand were put to immediate use to re-establish and preserve those elements ofcivilization necessary for human survival and progress.This assumption highlights in stark relief the dangerous “gap of history” in thestandard academic models of human prehistory, for as many people know, theremarkably stable, advanced, and highly integrated societies of Egypt and Sumersprang up rather suddenly and with very little antecedent preparation. They werejust suddenly there. It was into this “gap of history” that an Oxford professorstepped, showing that there had indeed been “preparation,” and that thispreparation had been done by an elite, that it was deliberately coordinated, andremarkably consistent in its spread over Europe and the Middle East."},{"pageContent":"A. AN OXFORD PROFESSOR OVERTURNS THE STANDARD MODEL: ALEXANDER THOM, HIS WORK,AND ITS IMPLICATIONS That professor’s name was Alexander Thom, and the work he did was nothing lessthan brilliant. So brilliant was it, in fact, that his results continue to bequestioned (a polite euphemism for “rejected”) by the history, anthropology, andarchaeology communities within academia. Indeed, Thom was not a professionalhistorian, anthropologist or archaeologist, and that was part of the problem. Hewas an engineer and a mathematician, and like engineer Christopher Dunn whowould so vex Egyptologists and anthropologists by maintaining that the GreatPyramid was a machine,43[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos633882] Thom’s conclusionswould fly wholesale in the face of the revered assumptions of anthropology,archaeology, and historiography regarding the ancient pre-classical history ofmankind. Thom’s work is relatively difficult to come by, but British authorsChristopher Knight and Alan Butler are two researchers who have studied itthoroughly and popularized his findings, expanding on them and addingconsiderable insights of their own, and accordingly their works will be followedclosely here.Born in the year 1894 in Scotland, Thom attended the University of Glasgow andlater returned there as an engineering lecturer. During World War II Thom didwork for the British government, and after the war was over, returned to theacademy, this time assuming a post as a Professor of Engineering at theUniversity of Oxford where he remained until he retired in 1961. Like so manyothers associated with the University of Oxford Thom developed an interest inthe “pre-history” of man, suspecting that all was not well with the “standardmodel”:> Thom’s interest in Megalithic structures began in his native Scotland, where> he noticed that such sites appeared to have lunar alignments. In the early> 1930s he decided to study some of the sites and began a process of careful> surveying that was to take him almost five decades. In addition to his> lecturing, Alexander Thom was a highly talented engineer in his own right and> he taught himself surveying, which enabled him to look at more Megalithic> sites — and in greater detail — than anyone before or since.44> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos634082] In this concentration on close engineering and surveying observations of ancientstructures, Thom was very much like another famous contemporary, Sir WilliamFlinders Petrie, the surveyor par excellence of the Giza plateau in Egypt.Thom’s excavations and surveying work took him five decades, surveying sights> from the gaunt and impressive standing-stone circles of the island of Orkney> in the far north of Scotland, right down to the giant avenues of stones in> their frozen march across the fields of Brittany in France... [where] Thom> spent each and every summer for almost five decades carefully measuring and> making notes. Together with family and friends and associates, he gradually> built up a greater database, regarding megalithic achievement in building,> than anyone before or since.45> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos634358] Thom eventually published the results of his studies and surveying in an articlewritten in 1951 for the Journal of the British Astronomical Association. Thearticle was entitled “The Solar Observations of Megalithic Man.” And over thenext three years Thom expanded on this by adding three more articles for theJournal of the Royal Statistical Society, as well as publishing three books onhis findings.46 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos634638]Almost as soon as he had published his first article, the grumblings ofdiscontent were heard from archaeologists and anthropologists, and by the timeof his final articles and books, that grumbling had grown into a deafeningsilence after an initial flurry of stubborn rejection. As Knight and Butlerstate the case, “The difference in approach between Thom and the generalarchaeological community is fundamental,”47[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos634822] and boils down to a“collision of techniques.”48[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos635006]Well might archaeologists have complained, for in essence, what Thom did was toprove that the supposedly “primitive” megalithic builders of Britain wereprofound astronomers, surveyors, and engineers in their own right. Justprecisely what had Thom done to earn the ire of archaeologists? He had made “astartling claim”:> He maintained that he had found that the structures left by late Stone Age man> had been built using a standard unit of measure that was so precise that he> could identify its central value to an accuracy that was less than the width> of a human hair. The idea that these simple people from prehistory could have> achieved such accuracy flew in the face of all the worldview of most> archaeologists.49 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos635153] But that was not the only problem, for this unit of measure, spread throughoutBrittany in France and the British isles, was consistent in that accuracy, andmoreover, was based — as we shall see in a moment — on extremely accurateastronomical and geodetic observation. How could it be, then, that “thesupposedly unsophisticated people of Stone Age Britain possessed a fullyintegrated system of measurement based on a deep understanding of the solarsystem”?50 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos635315]This, of course, was the real problem, for it implied a sophisticated knowledgebase from which the ancient sites were constructed, and that of course raisedthe dreaded possibility that something much more sophisticated by way of acivilization had pre-existed the Stone Age peoples. In short, Thom’s work raisedthe dreaded possibility of the “A” word, of “Atlantis.” In any case, thisstandard unit of astronomical and geodetic measure Thom called “The MegalithicYard,” and it became a banner around which supporters of the theory of apre-existent and sophisticated civilization rallied. Indeed, its mere existenceposed a kind of historiographical problematic for the standard views of humancivilization’s development, for “if he was wrong, the subject of statisticsneeds a fundamental reappraisal; but if his findings were reliable, the subjectof archaeology needs equally careful reassessment. Further, if Thom was right,the development of human civilization may have to be rewritten!”51[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos635461] Knight and Butlerquickly determined that the “only hope of resolving the issue, once and for all,was to attempt to find a reason why this length of unit would have had meaningfor Neolithic builders, and then to identify a methodology for reproducing sucha length at different locations.”52[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos635645]And here is where the mystery becomes even more intriguing!"},{"pageContent":"1. THOM’S MEGALITHIC YARD AND THE EXPANSIONS OF KNIGHT AND BUTLER To see just how intriguing the mystery is, we must first know exactly whatThom’s “megalithic measures” were.> Thom identified the use of a standard unit he called a ‘Megalithic Yard’ (MY),> which he specified as being equal to 2.722 ft +/- 0.002 ft (0.82966 m +/-> 0.061 m). He claimed that there were also other related units used repeatedly,> including half and double Megalithic Yards and a 2.5 MY length he dubbed a> Megalithic Rod (MR). On a smaller scale he found that the megalithic builders> had used a fortieth part of a Megalithic Yard, which he called a ‘Megalithic> Inch’ (MI) because it was 0.8166 of a modern inch (2.074 cm). The system> worked like this:> > 1 MI = 2.074 cm> > 20 MI = ½ MY> > 40 MI = 1 MY> > 100 MI = 1 MR.53 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos635784]> > But there was not only system in this ancient structure of measure, there wasamazing consistency over a very large area:> The lifetime work of Alexander Thom and his rediscovery of the Megalithic Yard> resulted in a stunning conclusion that created an immediate paradox — how> could an otherwise primitive people build with such fine accuracy? Why did> they do it and how did they do it? Thom made no attempt to answer these> questions. He reported on his engineering analysis and left the> anthropological aspects for others to explain. He did comment that he could> not understand how these builders transmitted the Megalithic Yards so> perfectly over tens of thousands of square miles and across several millennia> and he acknowledged that wooden measuring sticks could not have produced the> unerring level of consistency he had found.54> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos635975] How indeed had they done it? And much more importantly, why?The problem posed by these questions only deepens when one considers thestandard archaeological and anthropological view of where ancient measures camefrom:> According to Thom, the units he discovered were extraordinary because they> were scientifically exact. Virtually all known units of measurement from the> Sumerians and Ancient Egyptians through to the Middle Ages are believed to> have been based on average body parts such as fingers, hands, feet and arms,> and were therefore quite approximate.55> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos636138] In other words, Thom’s measurements, recorded over several thousand square milesin Britain and France, and recording an accuracy of this ancient unit of measureto within the width of a human hair, gave lie to the archaeological assumptionsthat ancient measures were based upon ever-varying body parts! Something elseentirely was in play!"},{"pageContent":"2. THE METHODS A. THOM’S “ANCIENT BUREAU OF STANDARDS” THEORY This fact posed an intriguing problem, namely, could one “reverse engineer” themethod by which supposedly primitive Megalithic builders had derived such anaccurate and consistent measure?One theory that attempts to do this is — for want of a better expression — the“ancient Bureau of Measures” theory. Thom himself was at a loss to explain theconsistent accuracy of the Megalithic Yard over such a large theory, and atfirst proposed the “ancient Bureau of Measures” theory:> This unit was in use from one end of Britain to the other. It is not possible> to detect by statistical examination any differences between the values> determined in the English and Scottish circles. There must have been a> headquarters from which standard rods (a rod could be of two types, but in> this context there are pieces of wood cut to represent the Megalithic Yard)> were sent out... The length of rods in Scotland cannot have differed from that> in England by more than 0.03 inch (0.762mm) or the difference would have shown> up. If each small community had obtained the length by copying the rod from> its neighbor to the south the accumulated error would have been much greater> than this.56 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos636301] But there was a major problem with this theory, and Knight and Butler are quickto point it out:> At that time Thom’s data could not be explained by any mechanism known to be> available to the people of the late Stone Age other than to assume that all> rods were made at the same place and delivered by hand to each and every> community across Scotland and England. Eventually, he would find the unit in> use from the Hebrides to western France, which makes the central ruler factory> theory look most unlikely. He also found it impossible to imagine why these> early communities wanted to work to an exact standard unit.57> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos636586] In other words, the unit was spread over too large an area for the “ancientBureau of Standards” theory to account for it. We will leave the full expositionof the answer to the question of why such primitive Stone Age people would havewanted “to work to an exact standard unit” to a later point in this chapter.Thus, effectively, we are back to square one: how did these “primitive” StoneAge peoples come up with such a unit of measure, and reproduce it with unerringaccuracy over such a wide area? The answer to that, according to Knight andButler, is rather astounding, and points in turn to a hidden and hardly“primitive” elite acting as a guiding hand, and working behind the scenes."},{"pageContent":"3. CELESTIAL GEOMETRIES AND THE PENDULUM METHOD The question of why such a primitive people would have need for such an accurateunit of measure spread over such a wide area is, however, crucial forunderstanding how they reproduced it. Knight and Butler state thismethodological problem in the following fashion: “We saw that the only hope ofresolving the issue, once and for all, was to attempt to find a reason why thislength of unit would have had meaning for Neolithic builders, and then toidentify a methodology for reproducing such a length at different locations.”58[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos636928] Optimally, this meantthat “what our Megalithic mathematicians needed was a method of reproducing theMegalithic Yard that was simple to use, very accurate and available to peopledispersed over a large distance and across a huge span of time.”59[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos637112] It was the classicengineer’s optimalization problem, for whatever this method was, it had to be amethod that also “ensured that the unit of length would not change across timeor physical distance,”60[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos637296] and this meant ofcourse that in all likelihood, the unit was founded on something with a fairlyconstant base “in the natural world”61[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos637443] that would not changeover time or physical location.That, of course, implied that the answer lay in the stars, and in the Earth,themselves. And if this be the case, then the most obvious unit immediatelyknown to such “primitive” observers would be a “day,” and this is where theultimate basis of the method of reproducing an accurate unit of measure begins:> There are various ways of defining a day and the two principal types are what> we now call a ‘solar’ day and a ‘sidereal’ day. A solar day is that measured> from the zenith (the highest point) of the Sun on two consecutive days. The> average time of the Sun’s daily passage across the year is called a ‘mean> solar day’ — it is this type of day that we use for our timekeeping today. A> sidereal day is the time it takes for one revolution of the planet, measured> by observing a star returning to the same point in the heavens on two> consecutive nights. This is a real revolution because it is unaffected by the> secondary motion of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. This sidereal day, or> rotation period, is 236 seconds shorter than a mean solar day, and over the> year these lost seconds add up to exactly one extra day, giving a year of just> over 366 sidereal days in terms of the Earth’s rotation about its axis.> In short, anyone who gauged the turning of the Earth by watching the stars> would know full well that the planet turns a little over 366 times in a year,> so it follows that this number would have great significance for such star> watchers. If they considered each complete turn of the Earth to be one degree> of the great circle of heaven, within which the Sun, Moon and planets move,> then they would also logically accept that there are 366 degrees in a circle.> There really are 366 degrees in the most important circle of them all — the> Earth’s yearly orbit of the Sun. Anything else is an arbitrary convention. It> seemed to us that this was so logical that the 360-degree circle may have been> a later adjustment to make arithmetic easier, as it is divisible by far more> numbers than the ‘real’ number of degrees in a year. In other words, the> circle of geometry has become somehow detached from the circle of heaven.62> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos637582] Note carefully the implication of these remarks, for the natural system of acelestial and geodetic measure would involve some system of a circle of 366degrees, while at some later point — largely for the sake of simplifiedarithmetical calculation — a modified or tempered system was put into place by“someone.” This is a significant point and it will be taken up again later inthis chapter.But how was this “original” 366-degree system derived by such primitive peoples?Seeking to reconstruct the thought processes of the Megalithic builders, Knightand Butler came to some very practical conclusions:> [It] is highly likely that they would also realize that sunrises across the> year move exactly like a pendulum. At the spring equinox (currently around 21> March) the Sun will rise due east and then rise a little further north each> day until the summer solstice (21 June) at which point it stops and reverses> its direction back to the autumn equinox and on to the winter solstice, by> which time it will rise well into the south. The Sun’s behaviour across a> year, as viewed from the Earth, creates exactly the same frequency model as a> pendulum. It displays a faster rate of change in the centre and slows> gradually to the solstice extremes, where it stops and reverses direction.63> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos637786] So the first problem was “to puzzle over the issue of how any unit of time couldpossibly be converted into a linear unit.”64[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos637973] The answer lay in themotion of the Sun during a year: the pendulum. In a certain way, the same ofcourse could be said of the motion of nearby planets, such as Venus, for byusing the very primitive “machine” of a pendulum and choosing a fixed referencepoint in the heavens, and counting the beats or swings of the pendulum as achosen star moved between fixed observation points on the horizon.The pendulum was a ready-made, simple machine, easily within the technologicalcapacities of Megalithic builders, and moreover, so closely tied to the“invariable” properties of the Earth itself that it formed the perfect basis forthe accuracy of Megalithic measures over so wide an area. The reason for this issimple, for the pendulum directly links the gravitational field of the Earth,the notion of time as a beat frequency, and the conversion of both to a linearmeasure:> The time it takes a pendulum to swing is governed by just two factors: the> mass of the Earth and the length of the pendulum from the fulcrum... to the> centre of gravity of the weight. Nothing else is of significant importance.> The amount of effort that the person holding the pendulum puts into the swing> has no bearing on the time per swing because a more powerful motion will> produce a wide arc and a higher speed of travel, whereas a low power swing> will cause the weight to travel less distance at a reduced speed. Equally, the> heaviness of the weight of the object on the end of the line is immaterial — a> heavier or lighter weight will simply change the speed/distance ratio without> having any effect on the time of the swing.> The mass of the Earth is a constant factor...and thus> in an area the size of the British Isles anyone swinging a pendulum for a> known number of swings in a fixed period of time will have almost exactly the> same pendulum length. 65> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos638157] So the method was simple: if one erected two markers on the circle of thehorizon, spaced ⅓66th of a degree apart, and then watching a selected star passbetween them and, through trial and error with pendulum lengths, eventually alength would be found that would produce a half Megalithic Yard when swung 366times as the star passed between the poles. And this would be the caseregardless of where one was, and it would produce that length with unerringaccuracy.66 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos638357] There wasabsolutely no need for an “ancient Bureau of Standards” whatsoever."},{"pageContent":"4. BEAUTIFUL NUMBERS: THE 366-, 365-, AND 360-DEGREE SYSTEMS The 366-degree system also bears a close connection to a geodetic measure,namely, the polar circumference of the Earth. As Knight and Butler put it, “themost common value quoted” for the polar circumference of the Earth is “40,008kilometers” which easily converts to “48,221,838 Megalithic Yards (MY).”67[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos638541] By assuming thatthese ancient Megalithic builders had divided each degree to 60 minutes of arcand each minute in turn to six seconds of arc, they are able to determine thatone degree (or ⅓66th) of the polar circumference of the Earth was 131,754Megalithic Yards, and one minute (⅙0th) of that value was 2,196 Megalithicyards. That, as they admitted, “did not look too exciting.”68[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos638688] But then when onedivided the minute by one second, or ⅙th of a part, the final result “was trulyremarkable” for it yielded 366 Megalithic Yards!69[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos638835]This astonishing result tied into yet another ancient measure, this time theso-called “Minoan Foot” from the island of Crete. Noting that “Professor J.Walter Graham of Princeton University” had made the discovery of “a standardunit of length” that had been used “in the design and construction of palaces onCrete dating from the Minoan period, circa 2000 B.C., Graham dubbed this unit a‘Minoan foot’ which he stated was equal to 30.36 centimetres.”70[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos638974] Knight and Butlerthen made the discovery that tied this measure to the whole 366-degreeMegalithic system they had found in Britain:> Imagine our surprise when we realized that one second of arc in the assumed> Megalithic system (366 MY) is equal to 303.6577 metres — which is exactly> 1,000 Minoan feet (given that Graham did not provide a level of accuracy> greater than a tenth of a millimetre). This fit could just be a very, very> strange coincidence — but it has to be noted that several researchers now> believe that the Minoan culture of Crete had ongoing contact with the people> who were the Megalithic builders of the British Isles.71> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos639121] But this was not all.There was in use in ancient Greece a unit of measure known as the “Olympian” or“geographical” foot, which, “by general consent” measures “what might at firstseem like a meaningless 30.861 centimetres.” And this raised even more peculiarrelationships for Knight and Butler, for it exposed a hidden relationshipbetween the Megalithic 366-degree system, and our now more familiar 360-degreesystem:> We immediately noticed something special about the relationship between the> Minoan foot and the later Greek foot. To an accuracy of an extremely close> 99.99 percent, a distance of 366 Minoan feet is the same as 360 Greek feet!> This was incredible, and we felt certain that it was not a coincidence. The> two units did not need to have any integer relationship at all — yet they> relate to each other in a Megalithic to Sumerian manner...72> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos639305] In other words, Sumeria — which was the origin of our modern 360-degree system —had entered the picture, and in a way that connected the two systems, the 366-and 360-degree systems.The link is evident from the Sumerian number system itself, which was asexagesimal system, that is to say, based on units of sixes, tens, and six-ties, and multiples thereof, thus making numbers such as 36, 360, 3600, and36,000 very “Sumerian” numbers. As we have already noted, it appears that theancients, in deriving the 366-degree system to begin with, had noticed thetransit of the sun through a year was approximately 365.25 days, and simplyrounded that number up to the next whole number, 366. The Sumerians, whoinfluenced the Egyptians, modified or tempered the entire system by coming upwith the 360-degree system in use to this day, to make calculation easier. Inother words, at first glance it would appear that there was, at a certain pointin prehistory, “Sumerian reform” to the Megalithic system. This is the positionof Knight and Butler, namely, that the Megalithic system is the oldest, and the“Sumerian reform” a later modification of it. But as we shall see later in thischapter, there is evidence — from a very unusual place, that the 360-degreesystem was in use long before the Sumerians or Megalithic builders of Britainwere even on the scene!But whatever the chronological relationship between the two systems was, therewas nonetheless a mathematical one, as was evidenced by the relationship of theMinoan to the Greek foot, the former representing a measure based on the 366system, and the latter one based on the 360 system. The problem was, what wasit?73 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos639453] Was it simply acase that “the 360-degree circle may have been a later adjustment to makearithmetic easier...”?74[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos639638] Or was something elseat work in addition to this?Knight and Butler quickly discovered what the mathematical relationship was, andthe relationship was that of two absolutely critical and fundamental constants,those of ƒ, with a value of 1.618, and π, with the value 3.14. Simply put, 360divided by 5 equaled 72, and 366 divided byπxƒ also equaled 72. While thedivision by 5 may seem arbitrary, it is not, for the constant ƒ generates thewell-known Fibonacci sequence — 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and so on — where the firsttwo numbers sum to the next number, then those two to the next, and so on. Sofive is in the “harmonic series,” so to speak, of ƒ.Then Knight and Butler made another astonishing connection between the twosystems. Noting that the Thornborough henges pointed to the mount in Lincolnover a distance 127 kilometers away, and finding that the two sites lay exactlyone Megalithic degree apart, that is, 366 x 60 x 6 Megalithic Yards from eachother, by latitude and exactly one degree apart by the modern system oflongitude meant, in effect, that for a period of time the Megalithic buildersappear to have used the 366 to measure longitude and the 360-degree system tomeasure latitude.75 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos639785]The “Sumerian reform” on which our entire modern system is based, in otherwords, had consisted of nothing but the use of the 360-degree system to measureboth."},{"pageContent":"5. THE NEXT STEP: MEASURES OF VOLUME AND WEIGHT Having thus found the means whereby an accurate unit of linear measure was soaccurately reproduced over so wide an area — namely, through the use of apendulum to count beats between markers on the circle of the horizon placed onedegree apart in a 366-degree system — and thus converting the measure of time toa linear measure of distance, the next problem was to introduce accurate unitsof measure of volume and weight based on that same linear measure. “Such a movewould have been an important building block towards trade, which was in turn akey step towards true civilization.”76[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos639970] In other words, thenecessary basis for international trade is accurate units of measure of volumeand weight, and that accuracy can only be guaranteed by basing units of measureon the relative constancy of celestial motions and the geodetic properties ofthe Earth itself.The problem was easily solved by performing what physicists call a “dimensionalrotation,” i.e., simply taking the linear measure, a unit of one dimension, androtating it into two dimensions (thus measuring area), and then finally, intothree dimensions, thus measuring volume. In short, the ancients simply “cubed”their Megalithic Yards, half-yards, and so on, to form the measures of volume.But when this was done, Knight and Butler began to make another astonishingseries of discoveries.> In our case, the linear units would have to be in Megalithic Inches, which> Thom identified as being one fortieth of a Megalithic Yard, equal to 2.07415> centimetres. Taking his lead from the metric system Chris first considered a> cube with sides of a tenth of a Megalithic Yard — i.e., four Megalithic Inches> (MI).

ANCIENT AND MEGALITHIC ANTICIPATIONS OF THE IMPERIAL AND METRIC SYSTEMS But then the problem became acute, and was disclosed by a conversation betweenco-authors Alan Butler and Chris Knight. I reproduce it here, because theirreactions would most certainly have been my own, and most likely anyone else’sdoing the experiments and running the numbers. The conversation begins withauthor Chris Knight:> “...I think we have a problem.”> “What sort of problem?” Alan wanted to know.> “The problem of explaining the apparently impossible,” said Chris. “I started> by checking out spheres with diameters of 5, 10 and 20 Megalithic Inches and> they also produce volumes that are quite close to the pint, one gallon, and> the bushel. The accuracy level isn’t quite as good as the cubes because the 5> (megalithic inches) sphere held 1.027 pints which is still as close as anyone> in the real world would ever need. But a quick check of the rules that govern> the relationships between cubes and spheres revealed that to an accuracy of> 99.256 percent a cube with a side of 4 units will have the same volume as a> sphere with a diameter of 5 units, which made the findings odd but> mathematically understandable.”> Alan was intrigued but puzzled.> “If there is no mystery about the pint sphere, why did you say you had to> explain the impossible?” he asked.> “What I’ve told you so far is the easy part of this conversation, because my> next test took me from the rather weird to the downright ridiculous.

What do they hold?” Alan asked, with not a little impatience.> “Well, the 6 MI sphere holds a litre and weighs a kilo, so the 60 MI sphere 10> x 10 x 10 times as much, holds a cubic metre and weighs a metric tonne. And> it’s incredibly accurate too.”> Alan laughed aloud down the phone.> “Ha ha, very funny...” He paused. “You are joking, aren’t you?”> “No. You check it out, Alan. The numbers don’t lie. The fit is better than 99> percent accurate and when I tested the same principles using modern inches and> centimetres for the spheres, there were no meaningful results at all.> Something truly weird is going on here.”78> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos640301] In other words, when modern imperial inches or metric centimeters were used toconstruct spheres and cubes, there were “no meaningful results at all.” But whenthe ancient Megalithic inch was used to construct cubes and spheres, the resultwas, in the case of the cubes, modern British imperial units of volume, and inthe case of the spheres, modern metric units of volume and weight! In otherwords, both the modern imperial and metric systems of volume appeared to berelated to the ancient units of measure precisely as being based on cubing andsphering. And further research revealed that even the Imperial weights appearedto be derived by cubing a unit one-tenth the length of the Megalithic Yard.79[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos640505]But in order to demonstrate the suggestion that there may indeed be an actuallink between the two systems, a link stemming from ancient times, one would haveto reproduce an ancient unit of measure that bears a resemblance to one or theother system. There was indeed such a unit, which the Sumerians called the“double kush,” approximately 99.88 centimeters long, which, oddly enough, madethe length of a pendulum of one second for accurate timekeeping.80[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos641075]All of this was compelling evidence that there was not only a deeply ancientroot and relationship between the modern British imperial and metric systems ofvolumes and weights, but that that root and relationship stemmed from a unit ofMegalithic linear measure that was cubed and “sphered.” All of this suggested,in other words, as Knight and Butler themselves commented, that someone verymuch wanted to “jump-start” civilization and create the conditions necessary for“international trade,” someone like a hidden elite.And this is where the story of that hidden elite, and its hidden agendas, takesanother astonishing turn."},{"pageContent":"B. THE HIDDEN ELITE AND THE COSMIC WAR SCENARIO"},{"pageContent":"1. THE ANCIENT ELITE: ASTRONOMY, FINANCE, AND THE GOD OF CORN VERSUS THE GOD OFDEBT Knight and Butler were not blind to the implications of their discoveries, andposited the existence of such a hidden elite, a guiding hand, steeringMegalithic man inevitably and inexorably along the road to (or, as we shall see,back to) civilization. How indeed was it possible “that the supposedly un-sophisticated people of Stone Age Britain possessed a fully integrated system ofmeasurement based on a deep understanding of the solar system?”81[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos641262]As they were investigating the British sites where Thom discovered theMegalithic Yard, Knight and Butler soon found an answer to that question, and itwas an answer with deeply significant implications. For example, the fact thatthere were so many such Megalithic sites scattered throughout the British Isles,and that each seemed to be designed for some astronomical purpose, suggestedthat “there might have been a national network”82[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos641445] of some sort inplace. And a network implies the organization and coordination of a select groupof people. In short, it implies an elite.One such site in particular intrigued Knight and Butler, and this was at SkaraBrae in Orkney Island. It intrigued them because> it may well have been a Megalithic ‘university’ for training> astronomer-priests. Radiocarbon dating has shown that it was occupied between> approximately 3215–2655 B.C. when it provided a series of linked rooms, each> with matching stone-built furniture including dressers, beds, cooking areas> and sealed stone water tubs for washing. Archaeologists have identified that> secrecy, security and plumbing are also apparent at the site. A secret> hidey-hole had been found under the stone dresser and a hole for a locking bar> was located on both sides of doors. In addition, a lavatory drain designed to> run excrement along wooden piping and into the sea has also been excavated....> .... Because the island had nothing to trade, the only reasonable answer to> this archaeological puzzle is that the inhabitants had been an elite group who> were supported by the goodwill of a broader community at a distance.> Skara Brae also revealed some artifacts that have proved impossible to> understand. Small stone objects that have been exquisitely carved include two> balls: one 6.2 centimeters and the other 7.7 centimeters in diameter. Their> purpose is unknown and the deep decoration appears to be impossible to create> without metal tools as engineer James Macauley discovered when he attempted to> reproduce them using the known technology of the time.83> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos641629] In other words, Skara Brae was basically confirmation of the existence of asupported elite, one that moreover had access to some sort of advanced metal andstone-working technology that was not common to the wider society supporting it.Skara Brae is also illuminating for another reason, one that Knight and Butlerdo not mention, for if there was an elite guiding a post-cosmic war humanityback up the long ladder to civilization, two of the essential steps that itwould take to do so are (1) to establish a system of weights and measuresaccurately reproducible over time and at any point on earth by means ofrelatively simple methods, and (2) it would establish a center or centers totrain people in the proper techniques of deriving these measures viaastronomical observation.Skara Brae, in other words, is testimony not only to the existence of thatelite, but also to its agendas, for> Without a means of gauging weight and volume, trade remains at a bartering> level where each transaction has to be assessed by visual evaluation alone.> The ability to identify a known quantity makes buying and selling a much more> scientific process since it can be accurately repeated time after time. Using> mutually accepted units of weight meant deals could be done at long range> because it would be unnecessary to see the merchandise first to assess its> quantity.84 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos641796] And thus we are in the presence of yet another agenda of that elite, for so longas there was no accurate system of measure that could easily and simply bereproduced anywhere on earth, what trade and civilization there was would beconfined to very small local areas. Hence, the presence of a “Megalithicuniversity” suggests very strongly that we are in the presence of an elite thatis attempting to foster trade over the widest area possible in order to createthe necessary and fundamental conditions for the emergence of a globalcivilization. We are thus chin to chin with that deeply ancient connectionbetween the hidden financial elites of ancient times, and the astronomy-templepriesthoods that I referred to in my previous book, Babylon’s Banksters,85[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos641980] for that alliance waspresent even prior to the emergence of the high civilizations of Sumer andEgypt. That elite, with its alliance of astronomy with a hidden financial andpolitical agenda, indeed created those civilizations.A brief word about that Megalithic financial-astronomical priesthood is inorder, lest its place within the wider context of my previous books bemisunderstood. As I noted in Babylon’s Banksters, the initial and earliest ideaof money was that it was simply a unit of exchange issued by the state itselfagainst the surplus of production in the state warehouses. As that productionexpanded, the money supply did; as it contracted, the money supply did. But thecrucial point to observe is that money was issued as a receipt on the productionof the state, and thus was issued debt-free. Since the probity of the state wasrepresented precisely by that astronomical-financial priesthood that had indeedcalled it into being, the issuance of “legal tender” — to use the modernparlance — was often associated with the temple. Thus, initially, thatastronomical-financial elite subscribed to a monetary policy that would, interms of religious imagery, be described as a worship of the “God ofproduction,” the “Corn God.”However, as I also detailed in Babylon’s Banksters, that elite was sooninfiltrated by another, or co-opted, and its own members corrupted from thisinitial “Corn God worship and monetary policy” and turned to a philosophy of theprivate monopoly issuance of debt as money. Or to put the change in monetarypolicy in terms of the religious imagery of the temple once again, worshipturned from the Corn God to the God of Contract and Debt, to the God to Whom adebt was owed and service due. To view the monetary policy in such religiousterms is to reveal the dirty little secret that began to take hold on humanculture as a result of that change in the elite that began to occur in Sumeriaand Babylonia, for as anyone knows, banks can only issue principal, notinterest, and thus as the circulation of monetized debt grows and replaces thecirculation of real money, the debt only increases for the many, to the profitof the few at the top of the pyramid and Ponzi scheme. Or, to put it in itsultimate religious expression, mankind comes by fits and starts into theinevitable situation where an infinite, or at least practically un-repayable,debt is owed to God, or the gods, requiring an infinite treasury to repay.86[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos642273] To put it assuccinctly as possible, the two monetary policies manifest themselves as thespiritual consequences of the worship of two very different Gods, and viceversa.87 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos642641]We have, then, that initial elite, and then another one that snakes its way intothe original, diverting its monetary policy, while retaining many of theoriginal agendas, including that of the creation of a global civilization."},{"pageContent":"2. THE MASONIC ELITE AND THE LORE OF “VERY HIGH ANTIQUITY” The presence of the Megalithic measures suggested, as has been seen, an elitewith an agenda, an agenda which included its own self-preservation andcontinuance over time. Knight and Butler put the point this way:> Indeed, the fact that the Megalithic units have an almost perfect relationship> with modern measurements strongly suggests that there has been a continuity of> this knowledge across the Great Wall of History.... That brought us to the> inventors of writing and the first known nation of international traders, the> Sumerians...88 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos642892] The Great Wall of History to which Knight and Butler refer is the “wall ofsilence” between the Megalithic Age and the earliest civilizations. But as weshall see, that wall is considerably higher and larger than they imagine. Itsimport, however, is the same: what relationship was there between the Megalithicbuilders and their measures, and Sumeria? Clearly there was a persistence ofinformation across that Great Wall of History, implying that an elite hadcarried that information forward.As Knight and Butler themselves point out, however, they were not the only onesto notice the implications; the other was none other than America’s thirdpresident, Freemason Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson investigated systems of weightsand measures shortly after America gained political independence from GreatBritain, and like Knight and Butler, made a similar series of discoveries aboutweights and measures in use in Britain and France as did Knight and Butler, andthese discoveries led him to some rather astonishing conclusions:> What circumstances of the times, or purposes of barter or commerce, called for> this combination of weights and measures, with the subjects to be exchanged or> purchased, are not now to be ascertained. But a triple set of exact> proportionals representing weights, measures, and the things to be weighed and> measured, and a relation so integral between weights and solid measures, must> have been the result of design and scientific calculation, and not a mere> coincidence of hazard.> ....But the harmony here developed in the system of weights and measures...> corroborated by a general use, from very high antiquity, of that, or of a> nearly similar weight under another name, seem stronger proofs that this is> legal weight...89 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos643076] Knight and Butler decided to follow Jefferson’s lead and see if his commentabout “very high antiquity” had any possibility of truth.Taking their cue from an ancient Sumerian tradition that spoke of the worldbeing measured in barley seeds,90[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos643270] Knight and Butlerdecided to see if there was any possible truth to the Sumerian tradition. Indoing so, they discovered the ultimate basis of the Sumerian sexagesimalnumerical system: the mass of the Earth itself!Since the Sumerian tradition had stated that the weight of the Earth wasmeasured in barley seeds, Knight and Butler began with the standard value of themetric mass of the Earth, 5/9763 x 1024 kilograms. They then converted thisfigure into a Sumerian unit of weight based on cubing the Sumerian double-kush.Once cubed, and filled with water, this in turn became the Sumerian unit of masscalled the “double-mana,” which weighed 996.4 grams. This meant that there were5.9979 x 1024 double-manas in the Earth’s mass.91[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos643446]Their commentary on the astonishing nature of what follows must now be cited toallow its full significance to sink in:> This number is as close to 6 followed by 24 zeros as to stand out as being> very odd indeed, particularly bearing in mind that we could not be certain as> to the “exact” intended size of the double-kush.

Simply astonishing!92> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos643631] But the problem was just beginning!Having already noticed the basis of the imperial and metric systems in theMegalithic measures, Knight and Butler decided to try a similar experiment forthe mass of the Earth in the imperial system. When this was done, they obtainedthe following results: 1 Megalithic-degree section of the Earth= 360 x 1020 pounds1 Megalithic-minutesection of the Earth= 6 x 1020 pounds1 Megalithic-second section of the Earth=1020 pounds93 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos643816] Their conclusion pointed inevitably to the existence of something beforeSumeria, and to a hidden elite that had passed on these units of celestial andgeodetic measure:> This could still be a double, outrageous coincidence but the odds against both> systems fitting like a near-perfect glove and bearing in mind the Sumerian> base 60 method of calculation, made it seem impossible.

The relationship of the pound weight and the double-mana (virtually a> kilogram) to the mass of the Earth did not seem compatible with the level of> sophistication of either the Megalithic people or the Sumerians.

For the first time we began to theorize about the strange possibility> of a group whose existence can only be deduced by the knowledge they left> behind.94 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos643964] But if civilizations such as Sumeria and Egypt were able to produce such systemsand maintain them with accuracy, would it not be inconsistent to ignore whatthey themselves say about their own origins? And they say, indeed, that at thefirst stages of their development — adevelopment stretching far beyond theMegalithic builders and into hundreds of millennia prior to that according tothe Sumerian Kings List95[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos644149] — that they wereindeed founded by “god-kings” who taught them the arts of civilization, artsthat would have included accurate systems of weights and measures. Moreover, thesheer extent of the presence of such measures, from Britain to Sumeria, wouldalso suggest that we are in the presence of an elite that is scattered — or thathas intentionally scattered itself — over the surface of a wide area of theEarth as a kind of “paleoancient international” priesthood oftrader-astronomers."},{"pageContent":"C. THE COSMIC WAR: MARDUK MEASURED THE STRUCTURE OF THE DEEP So how does all this measuring activity in ancient times fit into the “CosmicWar” scenario? What agendas might it disclose beyond that already suggested,namely, that an elite was in a hurry to stimulate trade based on reliable andaccurately reproducible units of measure based on astronomical observation?The answer to these questions is suggested by a short statement that occurs atthe end of the fourth tablet of the so-called Babylonian creation epic, theEnuma Elish. The statement is that “The Lord,” i.e., the Babylonian god Marduk,“measured the structure of the Deep.”96[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos644385] But the contextreveals why this was necessary, and what is meant within the context by “theDeep”:> 47.

Thus viewed, theverses are a garbled, though nonetheless clear indication of a sophisticatedtechnology and hence of a sophisticated civilization with a very sophisticatedphysics.

At the minimum, then, the Megalithic measures and theirself-evident propagation by a hidden elite — as Knight and Butler have shown —is a demonstration of the first agenda. As we shall discover in the comingpages, however, there is ample evidence to suggest that another elite is at workfor purposes that are not so benign. And this brings us back to Sumeria, and thesuggestions of that deeper physics."},{"pageContent":"1. THE SUGGESTIONS OF A DEEPER PHYSICS As has been seen, the principle basis of the ancient units of measure was theconversion of a regular measure of time into a unit of linear measure via asimple “pendulum method.” Then by the process of cubing or “sphering” thatlinear measure, that unit of linear measure was converted into units of measurefor volume and, when those cubes or boxes were filled with a quantity of a knownsubstance, such as water, units of measure for mass, thus reproducing simply andelegantly accurate units of measure based on known astronomical phenomenainvariant over the surface of the Earth.But Knight and Butler did not let things stand there, for the observation thattime and linear measure were deeply and intimately connected was, of course, oneof the profound insights of Albert Einstein and his special theory ofrelativity. Sensing that the ancient measures possibly pointed to knowledge of amuch deeper physics, they decided to subject the Sumerian measures to “the acidtest” to determine if, in fact, their knowledge might have come from a much moreancient, and much more sophisticated, civilization:> Throughout our investigation we have tried not to prejudge what is, and is> not, possible for an ancient culture to achieve.

Torsion has been a “physics theme” of many of my books,106[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos646193] but for our purposeshere we may understand torsion as the spiraling, folding, and pleating of thefabric of space-time around any rotating mass. If one wishes to draw a mentalpicture of what torsion accomplishes, the analogy of wringing an empty soda canlike a dishrag is helpful. As one wrings the can, the can spirals and folds andpleats, and the ends of the can draw closer together. In this analogy, the canwould represent space-time."},{"pageContent":"2. THE “SUMERIAN” MYSTERIES OF DEEP SPACE But is there any other confirmation that Knight’s and Butler’s conclusion — thatthe Sumerians derived their knowledge from someone else, someone much moreancient and much more advanced — than merely numerical coincidence? Indeed thereis, and it comes from renowned space anomalies investigator Richard C. Hoagland,or rather, from some very remarkable NASA photographs of an object doing somevery “Sumerian” things.That object is Saturn’s “moon,” Iapetus and the remarkable — nay, mind-bogglingand unbelievable — photographs of it taken by NASA’s probe Cassini. In what isundoubtedly one of his most fascinating pieces of analysis and discussion ofNASA images, Hoagland reproduced the following Cassini images in a paperentitled “A Moon with a View.” As will be evident to anyone who looks at thepictures, Saturn’s “moon” Iapetus is not a moon at all, it’s anine-hundred-mile-wide artificial body.The first testament of that fact is that Iapetus, unlike “moons,” hasextraordinarily straight edges when viewed in highlighted by the light of theSun:023 [images/00023.jpg]Iapetus’ Straight Edges And in close-up, these are even more evident:024 [images/00024.jpg]Iapetus’ Straight Edges in Close-Up But that is not the only difficulty. The really major problems are the threeparallel ridges that run the circumference of its equator, a geologicalimpossibility:025 [images/00025.jpg]Iapetus’ Equatorial Parallel Ridges As if that’s not enough, when viewed full-on, Iapetus displays a largehexagonally-shaped “crater” just above these equatorial “ridges”:026 [images/00026.jpg]Iapetus’ Hexagonal “Crater” If that picture looks hauntingly familiar, that’s because it is, and Hoaglandwas quick to spot its resemblance to something much more sinister in recentpopular culture: George Lucas’ “Death Star” from his famous Star Wars movieepics:027 [images/00027.jpg]Richard C. Hoagland’s Iapetus-Death Star Comparison107[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos646672] None of this, however, even comes close to comparing with what Iapetus is doing,and how it is doing it.As Hoagland notes in his paper, Iapetus is doing some very odd things as itorbits Saturn. In fact, the odd things are its orbit around Saturn. Like Earth’sown massive moon, Iapetus’s orbit around Saturn is a nearly perfect circle. Andalso like Earth’s moon, Iapetus turns on its own axis in such a fashion that thesame hemisphere is always facing Saturn! And unlike all of Saturn’s other moons,Iapetus is inclined 15 degrees from its equator. But that’s not all. It’s bestto allow Hoagland to speak for himself here:> Once the (amazing) possibility is admitted that Iapetus could be an artificial> “moon” — and may have been deliberately inserted into such an odd orbit — the> “coincidental” nature of its unique, steep inclination (relative to the other> similar-sized Saturnian moons — Dione, Rhea, etc.) goes away.> But, equally “coincidental” is the shape of Iapetus’ inclined orbit... and its> precise distance from Saturn. Iapetus’ orbit is extremely close to being> circular — with an eccentricity of only 0.0283 departing from a perfect circle> by slightly less than 3%. (By comparison, our Moon’s orbital eccentricity...> is 0.0549 or ~6%...essentially twice as eccentric as Iapetus!)> For an almost circular, very high inclination orbit to have formed through> “random chance” is really pushing coincidence — if the agent for achieving> that low eccentricity and the high inclination is supposed to be the same> “random” collisional event, back when Iapetus was forming.108> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos647709] As I have noted elsewhere, such orbital mechanics in the case of our own Moonhas led some scientists, particularly in Russia, to have concluded that theEarth’s own satellite exists in an artificial and deliberately created orbit, asit has also led some to argue that our own Moon may be an artificial body.109[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos647993]But, as Hoagland quips, “there’s more”:> The sharp reader will have noticed, from the preceding references, that> Iapetus orbits slightly less than 60 radii away from Saturn (59.09) radii, to> be exact...). This discrepancy, 0.15% — in the artificial model that precisely> 60 radii was originally intended — would represent how much Iapetus has> drifted since it was “parked” (as a designed “station”) in Saturn’s orbit.> That rate of drift, either due to Saturnian/sun tides, or other forces...could> give another way to estimate — other than by counting craters — roughly “when”> this entire scenario in fact occurred. ...110> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos648265] As I noted elsewhere, what Hoagland is referring to is the fact “that Iapetusorbits Saturn some two million miles from the planet, which is almost exactlysixty times the radius of Saturn.”111[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos648419] By now that number —sixty — should sound very familiar, for it is the whole basis of the Sumeriansexagesimal numerical system! Hoagland is quick to see this, for “that ‘ideal’Iapetus distance from Saturn just ‘happens’ to also be base 60... suddenlyappearing in the first Sumerian civilization on Earth some 6000 years ago...”112[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos648594] To put it assuccinctly as possible: it would appear that someone had “parked” Iapetus in anorbit around Saturn using the very basis of a sexagesimal system that onlyemerged on Earth sometime later, and thus, that there may indeed be a culturalconnection between Sumeria and an artificial body in our solar system millionsof miles from the Earth!"},{"pageContent":"3. A CHRONOLOGICAL CONUNDRUM All this places the origin of Megalithic measures, and the probable role of anelite in deriving them, into an entirely different context, and it raisesprofound and thorny chronological questions. As I outlined in my previous bookThe Cosmic War, if such an interplanetary war did occur, it most likely occurredca. 3.2 million years ago.113[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos648765] But the measuringactivity represented by the Megalithic builders at best represents an activitythat was begun no earlier than 10,000–12,000 years ago,114[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos649023] and in the case ofthe British Megalithic builders, an activity only a few thousand or so yearsolder than the Great Pyramid.115[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos649550] This places thechronological problem into stark relief, for presumably such measuring activitywould have begun shortly after the conclusion of the war, yet the evidencesuggests it was begun some three million years later. While there is no easy wayaround this problem, it is possible that such activity may have begun when thosesurviving elites thought the population of the Earth had been restored to asufficient level to warrant their activities in creating the necessities ofcivilization. Nonetheless, the problem remains, and there may be as yetundiscovered facts that would fill in this lengthy gap more plausibly."},{"pageContent":"D. CONCLUSIONS So what may be concluded from the existence of the Megalithic measures and theirincredible basis in accurate astronomical measurement? What may be concludedfrom the presence of Sumerian measures in the orbital mechanics of Saturn’s“moon” Iapetus? What agenda or agendas do these dimly disclose? From what hasbeen examined thus far we may comfortably conclude the following:> 1. The mere existence of the Megalithic measures, their accuracy, the> inclusion within them of accurate and sophisticated astronomical and physics> data — including the velocity of light and the mass of the Earth — point to> the existence of a surviving elite from a civilization at least as advanced as> our own.> This observation requires some commentary.

This, I noted, would have led inevitably to the rise of an> international mercantile and bullion-trading class. I then asked two> questions: “Is it possible that, rather than such a class having emerged as a> consequence of such governmental policies and trade, that the converse is> true? Is it possible that there existed such a class of “international bullion> brokers” who created these policies in various parts of the world, policies> which would enhance their own power and wealth? If so, then how did they> achieve and orchestrate this?”116> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos650122] The answer may now> be given, for in view of the fact that such an elite would have required> accurate units of measure to even be able to conduct trade, the early> emergence of the use of such measures long before the rise of classical> civilizations compels to the conclusion that in fact that elite did pre-exist> those policies and the cultures that created them by several millennia.> Moreover, as we shall see in the last chapter of this book, there is a> significant piece of evidence that trade itself existed long before the> establishment of these units of measure in Neolithic times.> 2.

It is when we turn to considerthe other major preoccupation of that “post-Cosmic War” elite — religion — thatthe plot, and the agendas, begin to thicken considerably."},{"pageContent":"Three THE TECHNOLOGIES OF SPECIAL REVELATION: MIND MANIPULATORS, TORSION TEMPLES, AND RELIGION REVEALERS 028 [images/00028.jpg]> “...In 1973, Dr. Joseph Sharp, of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research,> expanded on Frey’s work in an experiment where the subject — in this case,> Sharp himself — ‘heard’ and understood spoken words delivered via a> pulsed-microwave analog of the speaker’s sound vibrations.”— Martin Cannon117 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos650367] > > > > “In some patients electrical stimulation of the exposed temporal lobe has> produced the perception of music.

This is nowhere more true than of religion itself, for if oneassumes the existence of such scientific sophistication, then perforce oneassumes the existence of what might be termed “the oracular technologies ofspecial revelation,” or at least of the possibility of constructing them.One event in modern times highlights, as does no other, the possibilities of the“oracular technologies of revelation,” and of the implications of thosetechnologies for the claims of ancient revelations. That the technologiescurrently exist to manipulate the mind, the emotions, and to do so at a distanceis no longer in doubt. But what most people do not realize is that thosetechnologies have been taken far beyond the induction of generalizedpsychological states through direct physiological stimulation of the humanbrain. Those technologies are now capable of making people think they are seeingspecific visions and hearing voices that say specific things. They are powerfultechnologies that, used with or without conjunction with other technologies,could even lead people to believe that they are receiving special revelationsand instructions from God Himself.The ethical problem posed by the existence of such technologies is furthercompounded when one considers the moral problems they engender, i.e., when oneconsiders what those “special revelations” might be telling people to do, eitherto themselves, or to others. Additionally, their possible existence and use inancient times poses difficult theological and apologetic problems for religionsclaiming a basis on the special revelations given to isolated individuals, asrecorded in any number of sacred scriptures of various religions.Outlining such a case, however, is fraught with difficulties, since so fewpeople know of the existence of such technologies, much less of the degree ofperfection that they are known to exhibit, much less the actual degree ofdevelopment which remains cloaked in secrecy. Fewer still are aware of thedistinctive datasets that eerily connect the details of claimed ancient specialrevelations and oracles with the capabilities of those modern technologies.Accordingly, we shall outline them as thoroughly as possible, and then turn tothe unusual arguments and data points that connect the modern technologies tothe indications of their possible use in ancient times. Again, the reader isreminded of what was said in the preface to this book: these possibilities ofinterpretation are raised to highlight the looming problems for religiousapologetics, and those problems will only grow and increase, not decrease, withtime, as the technological sophistication of modern society lays bare ever moreand more interpretive possibilities in ancient texts.The modern event that highlights the dangerous potentialities of suchtechnologies within the context of religion is the siege of the Branch Davidiancompound in Waco, Texas, in 1993."},{"pageContent":"A. DAVID KORESH HEARS THE VOICE OF GOD... OR WAS IT JUST CHARLTON HESTON? David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidian religious compound in Waco, Texas,was (so the official story goes) a man who claimed a special and unique statusas a leader within his community.119[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos650960] According to somenewspaper and magazine articles he saw himself as a veritable second Messiah,uniquely plugged into the mind and thoughts of God. From such a privilegedposition within his community, he led his followers to a ruinous conflagrationand death... or so the story goes.But few people now recall that during the numerous interviews of “officialspokesmen” on the major networks, those spokesmen made no secret that variousforms of psychological warfare were being deployed against the Branch Davidiansunder siege inside their compound, from everything from loud rock music beingplayed 24 hours a day, to other techniques of “inducement.”One of those techniques was exposed by researcher Jon Ronson in a book that hasrecently been made into a movie, The Men Who Stare at Goats, and it affords ourentry into the topic of the “oracular technologies of revelation,” or, to put itmore succinctly and baldly, mind manipulation. The question that inspired hishunt, and that eventually led him to the Branch Davidians, was innocent enough:“Was there,” he asked, “somewhere out there, a paper trail of patents forsubliminal sound technologies, or frequency technologies, that simply vanishedinto the classified world of the United States government?”120[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos651179] The answer that hefound was not so innocent:> On October 27, 1992, Dr. Oliver Lowery, of Georgia, was the recipient of U.S.> Patent #5,159,703. His invention was something he called a Silent Subliminal> Presentation System:> “A silent communications system in which non-aural carriers, in the very low> or very high audio-frequency range of the adjacent ultrasonic frequency> spectrum, are amplitude- or frequency-modulated with the desired intelligence> and propagated acoustically or vibrationally, for inducement into the brain,> typically through the use of loudspeakers, earphones, or piezoelectric> transducers. The modulated carriers may be transmitted directly in real time> or may be conveniently recorded and stored on mechanical, magnetic or optical> media for delayed or repeated transmission to the listener.”121> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos651406] Note the euphemistic phrase “modulated with the desired intelligence” and theequally euphemistic reference to the “listener” of these amplitude- andfrequency-modulated “subliminal presentations,” for amplitude and frequencymodulation are, of course, the two types of modulation in use in AM and FMradios, and modulation itself is simply the fancy term for the information beingencoded into the radio waves, that is to say, for the information you hear whenyou turn on your radio. Thus, the phrase “modulated with the desiredintelligence” really simply means “modulated with the desired information” thatis being “subliminally presented” to the “listener.”Just what was the “desired intelligence” or “information” to be subliminallypresented to the “listener”? According to Ronson,> The following emotional states could, according to Lowery, be induced by his> invention:> Positive emotions: contentment, duty, faith, friendship, hope, innocence, joy,> love, pride, respect, self-love, and worship.122> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos651611] This is an interesting list in and of itself, given our hypothesis that suchtechnologies might possibly underlie certain special revelations in ancienttimes. But what of the “negative” emotions? Lowery’s list here is as equallydisturbing as the so-called “positive” ones:> Negative emotions: anger, anguish, anxiety, contempt, despair, dread,> embarrassment, envy, fear, frustration, grief, guilt, hate, indifference,> indignation, jealousy, pity, rage, regret, remorse, resentment, sadness,> shame, spite, terror, and vanity.123> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos651798] But it did not end there, as Ronson soon discovered.A mere four years later, on December 13, 1996 to be precise, Ronson discoveredthat Lowery’s company, called Silent Sounds Inc., had posted a message on itswebsite that made for some very disturbing reading:> “All schematics have [now] been classified by the U.S. Government and we are> not allowed to reveal the exact details... we make tapes and CDs for the> German Government, even the former Soviet Union countries! All with the> permission of the U.S. State Department, of course.... The system was used> throughout Operation Desert Storm (Iraq) quite successfully.”124> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos651966] Apparently Dr. Lowery’s invention had found some rather interesting “buyers” —the United States, Germany, and “former Soviet countries” — as well as somerather unique “listeners,” presumably Iraqi civilians and soldiers during theFirst Gulf War.But what did all of this have to do with David Koresh and the “evil” BranchDavidians under siege in Waco, Texas, ready to break out and storm the M1A1Abrams tanks with their assault rifles?Ronson dug further with Dr. Lowery, and soon Lowery mentioned the name of aRussian researcher who had invented a very similar technology, Dr. Igor Smirnov.> I looked Dr. Smirnov up. I found him in Moscow. I corresponded with his> office, and his assistant (Dr. Smirnov speaks little English) told me the> following curious story.> It is a story the FBI has never denied.> Igor Smirnov was not prospering in the post-Cold War Moscow of 1993.

Those messages said, “Do not get drunk before battle.”125> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos652151] Then, however, the story began to get very interesting, and with it, theimplications of such technologies for claims of revelation multiply likerabbits:> But the glory days were long gone by March 1993 — the month Igor Smirnov> received a telephone call, out of the blue, from the FBI.

Secondly, itis also to be noted that the FBI was not hesitant to deploy such technology onAmerican citizens. Thirdly, and finally, it is also to be noted that the FBI hada specific use in mind for that technology in Koresh’s case: it wanted Smirnovto convince Koresh that he was receiving another revelation, hearing the voiceof God Himself, while in reality, the voice being heard was only the hiddenagenda of the FBI. The pattern — that of an elite in possession of a technologywhich it is using for a hidden agenda, hiding it behind the “voice of God” — hasits own obvious and disturbing implications for the hypothesis of the possibleexistence and use of such technologies in ancient times.But one should also take note of two basic facts about the technology — and thetechnique — used by Dr. Smirnov, for both optical and aural techniques were usedsimultaneously and in conjunction with each other. The BBC even ran a shortreport on two unnamed Russian “psychologists” that were brought in by the FBI.During the report, the Russians’ equipment was shown, which included flashinglights on television, as the reporter stated that various key words were beamedin white noise to the “listener.” We may refer to these two significant datapoints and techniques as the “flashing lights” and “strange sounds”techniques.127 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos652510]In any case, what came of the FBI’s attempt to recruit Dr. Smirnov and histechnology for use during the Waco massacre?> The FBI flew Dr. Smirnov from Moscow to Arlington, Virginia, where he found> himself in a conference room with representatives of the FBI, the CIA, the> Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Advanced Research Projects Agency.> The idea, the agents explained, was to use the telephone lines.

An FBI agent said he was> concerned that the endeavor might somehow lead to the Branch Davidians> committing mass suicide. Would Dr. Smirnov sign something to the effect that> if they did kill themselves as a result of the voice of God being subliminally> implanted in their heads, he would take responsibility?> Dr. Smirnov said he wouldn’t sign something like that.> And so the meeting broke up.> An agent told Dr. Smirnov it was a shame it didn’t work out. He said they had> already co-opted someone to play the voice of God.> Had Dr. Smirnov’s technology been put into practice at Waco, the agent said,> God would have been played by Charlton Heston.128> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos652858] If true — and there is no reason to disbelieve Ronson’s research — then thisaccount sheds much light not only into the disturbing possibilities of mindmanipulation technology, but also upon the agendas of the elites who would useit, for note the subtle suggestion is that the FBI was perhaps contemplatingputting the “suggestion” into Koresh’s mind to have everyone inside his compoundcommit mass suicide à la Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple cult. Had thathappened, it would not have been the first time that the voice of “God” hasurged wholesale slaughter through a spokesman who has received a “revelation.”But more of that later."},{"pageContent":"B.

THE ALIEN ABDUCTION SCENARIO AND THE MORAL DISCONNECT Martin Cannon is a researcher who has pulled together the most salient articlesand books on the subject of mind control and compiled them into an intriguingexamination of the alleged phenomenon of “alien abduction” in an Internetarticle entitled “The Controllers: A New Hypothesis of Alien Abduction.”129[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos653040] However, thephilosophical implications of his observations certainly spill far beyond thecontainers of “alien abduction” and raise serious questions for the wholeprospect of religious revelations as a technologically manipulated phenomenon.Cannon observes that within the field of ufology> the term “abduction” has come to refer to an infinitely confounding> experience, or matrix of experiences, shared by a dizzying number of> individuals, who claim that travelers from the stars have scooped them out of> their beds, or snatched them from their cars, and subjected them to> interrogations, quasi-medical examinations, and “instruction” periods.> Usually, these sessions are said to occur within alien spacecraft; frequently,> the stories include terrifying details reminiscent of the tortures inflicted> in Germany’s death camps.

As will be seensubsequently, this “moral disconnect” is a common feature within“post-revelation” occurrences within religion, and even then, when “ordinary”emotions appear to surface within the religious “experiencer,” these are quicklydealt with by a variety of techniques."},{"pageContent":"2. THE FALSE DIALECTIC, OCCAM’S RAZOR, AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS Cannon maintains that a false dialectic of interpretive possibilities has beendeliberately created around the abduction phenomenon, a dialectic createdprecisely in order to deflect attention from a possible interpretation thatexplains the phenomenon and its real origins. That dialectic is between the“extraterrestrial believers” on the one hand, and the “abduction skeptics” whowould maintain that nothing other than particularly vivid nightmares areoccurring on the other: The myth of the UFO has provided an effective coverstory for an entirely different sort of mystery.

These two poles established what I call “The RoswellDialectic.”134 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos654277] Whatboth dialectics are designed to do is to conceal the possibility of veryterrestrial technological explanations for the two events, and to conceal thepossible agendas those technologies might suggest.This dialectic immediately reveals serious ramifications for the technologicalpossibilities of explanation of various “special revelations” in religioushistory, for one need but substitute the word “God” in the “ET” pole of thedialectic to disclose yet another possibility of locking interpretations intotwo mutually exclusive poles to conceal a possibly hidden third technologicalalternative: God becomes opposed to “skepticism,” that is to say, to atheism andagnosticism with their “purely mundane” trivializations of what ancient textsstate about their special “revelations.”Cannon states this difficulty in connection with Occam’s razor:> Certainly, we are not being narrow-minded if we ask researchers to exhaust all> terrestrial explanations before looking heavenward.> Granted, this particular explanation may, at first, seem as bizarre as the> phenomenon itself.

As outright murder was considered to be morallyrepugnant, the solution quickly devolved into erasing the memory of the event,or implanting entirely false contexts within the victims’ minds by which tointerpret it. Thus a whole new chapter in mind-control experimentation began,namely, how to wipe selective memories and replace them with false ones? Andhere, an experience of “God” will work just as well as an experience with “ET,”raising yet more possibilities."},{"pageContent":"3. ELECTRONIC METHODS OF MIND MANIPULATION So what exactly are the known technologies of mind manipulation? How do theywork? And what are their capabilities? We have already, in our examination oftheir planned and actual use on David Koresh and the Branch Davidians, seen someof them. The various means might conveniently be divided into two categories:(1) “soft” ones, involving techniques of manipulating the mind into channels ofinterpretive possibilities, such as was noted in the case of the dialecticalchanneling of the interpretations of “alien abductions” and the Roswellincident; and (2) “hard” ones, involving actual technological manipulations ofthe mind by various means. Our concentration here will be upon the technologicalmeans, as opposed to the techniques.In the CIA’s own studies of the techniques and technologies of mind manipulation— which we may assume is a fairly representative template of the work conductedin other nations — virtually the entire spectrum was experimented upon, from“soft” techniques such as hypnosis, drugs, the creation and manipulation ofreligious cults, extra-sensory perception (ESP), sensory deprivation, andconditioning, to “hard” technologies such as the use of microwaves, brainimplants, psychosurgery, and all possible combinations of them.137[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos654888] These experimentsincluded projects for> the “erasure of memory, hypnotic resistance to torture, truth serums,> post-hypnotic suggestion, rapid induction of hypnosis, electronic stimulation> of the brain, non-ionizing radiation, microwave induction of intracerebral> “voices,” and a host of even more disturbing technologies.138> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos655061] Whatever the “host of even more disturbing technologies” may have been, it iscrucial to note here the use of microwaves to induce the actual “hearing” ofvoices into the human brain. The implication, both for the “ET abduction”scenario and for the technological potentialities of “revelation manipulation”are rather obvious."},{"pageContent":"A. ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS, IMPLANTS, AND COMBINATIONAL APPROACHES The earliest types of electric manipulation of the brain included directimplantation of electronic components in the brain. Noting that abductees “oftendescribe operations in which needles are inserted into the brain” and “morefrequently still, they report implantation of foreign objects through the sinuscavities,” Cannon observes that as abduction researchers leap to theextraterrestrial conclusion from these bizarre circumstances, they “have failedto familiarize themselves with certain little-heralded advances in terrestrialtechnology.”139 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos655225]> The abductees’ implants strongly suggest a technological lineage which can be> traced to a device known as a “stimoceiver,” invented in the late ’50s-early> ’60s by a neuroscientist named Jose Delgado.

THE REMOTE INDUCTION OF TRANCES AND “HEARING VOICES” But such technologies and techniques were taken even further in work done in1973!> Trance may be remotely induced — but can it be directed? Yes.

Schapitz, who in 1974 filed a plan to explore the interaction of radio> frequencies and hypnosis.

ELECTRONIC DISSOLUTION OF MEMORY: MISSING TIME, AND MISSING HISTORY As previously noted, one of the major problems that early mind manipulationresearch encountered was the “disposal” problem, i.e., how would theperpetrators of the experiments keep the experiments secret? One way, of course,was to simply have the participants murdered, but the other way, erasure ofcertain parts of their memory, was a more efficient “method” and one which, ifmeans for doing so could be developed, would have its own benefits in thearsenal of mind manipulation. The goal was “EDOM,” or “Electronic Dissolution ofMemory.” It is accomplished by nothing more complicated than the “blockage ofsynaptic transmission in certain areas of the brain,”146[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos657068] similar to whathappens in an ordinary stroke. The effect, again, can be produced byelectromagnetic “jamming” of the signals of neural pathways, with the resultthat there is an “erasure of memory from consciousness” in “certain areas of thebrain.”147 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos657242] The resultis “missing memory,” which, if one looks at it a different way, is nothing butthe abductees’ “missing time” phenomenon, for by erasing memory, one is erasingtime, and by erasing time — if performed on a large enough group of people, oneis perforce erasing history.148[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos657383]Without certain memories, a person’s — or a group of persons’ — context forinterpreting events and making decisions will inevitably change, so memoryerasure can also be viewed as a means of social manipulation for the purpose ofproducing a certain class of actions. Again, the obvious implications for theputative “technologies of revelation” is rather obvious.But there is another possibility that such electromagnetic mind manipulationmight have, and within the context of the possibility of truly planetbustingweapons, it is a frightening one, for one must ask: would a normal, sane personpress a button and blow up a planet, à la George Lucas’ celebrated “Death Star”in his epic movie Star Wars? Probably not. What is required is no longer a“normal soldier,” but an insane one:> There have always been recruits for even the most hazardous duties; what need> of hypnosis?> The need, in fact, is absolute.> The modern battlefield has little place for the traditional soldier.

Why use drugs, which will leave traces — evidence — in the body, whenelectro-magnetic waves will do the same trick, and produce no detectable traces?"},{"pageContent":"D. “ABDUCTIONS” AND “REVELATIONS:” A COMMON METHOD Strangely enough, there is more than just a passing similarity between the“alien abduction” experience and religious revelations, for as Cannon notes,many of those who have been victims of the abduction experience — and let’s behonest, they are victims — “have been directed to join certain religious/philosophical sects.”150[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos658792]> I strongly urge abduction researchers to examine closely any small “occult”> groups an abductee might join.

THE BEAT FREQUENCY OF THE BRAIN “The brain,” notes Cannon, “has a ‘beat’ of its own.”155[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos659758] This fact wasdiscovered by the German psychiatrist Hans Berger in 1924. Berger observed> two distinct frequencies: alpha (8–13 cycles per second), associated with a> relaxed, alert state, and beta (14–30 cycles per second), produced during> states of agitation and intense mental concentration. Later, other rhythms> were noted, which are particularly important for our present purposes: theta> (4–7 cycles per second), a hypnogogic state, and delta (.5 to 3.5 cycles per> second), generally found in sleeping subjects.156> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos659932] These publicly available facts became the basis for a whole new “industry”beginning in the late 1970s and into the early 1980s, as clever inventorsdevised machines like the “hemi-synch,” a headphone-like device that produced“slightly different frequencies in each ear” which the brain would thencalculate the difference between, resulting in a kind of “beat frequency” towhich it would then entrain itself. In other words, “the subject’s[electro-encephalogram] would slow down or [speed] up to keep pace with itselectronic running partner.”157[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos660073]This idea of a beat frequency may seem odd or even unimportant, but it is infact one of the crucial operational principles of so-called “scalarelectromagnetics,” and a word or two more of explanation is thus worthwhilehere. The whole basis of this type of phenomenon is interferometry and theestablish- ment of a “beat frequency” as a kind of template for action. And theway to establish that “beat frequency template” is precisely to interfere, orblend, two or more signals of different frequencies on a region. The differencebetween all these interfered or blended frequencies then sets up a “standingwave” that is based on the beat frequency. One may think of the simple — thoughclumsy — analogy of taking a handful of pebbles of different sizes and throwingthem into the calm surface of a pond. Each pebble will produce a wave pattern asit strikes the surface, and those patterns will cross and blend, establishing amomentary pattern on the surface that would represent the standing wave of thebeat frequency. It is this pattern or template that the brain entrains itselfto, and this point will become crucial in later sections of this chapter."},{"pageContent":"5. THE BEAT FREQUENCY, AND OUT-OF-THE-BODY EXPERIENCES Oddly enough, one of the claims made for some of the “brain machines” thatbecame popular during the late 1970s and early 1980s was that they could also“induce ‘Out-of-Body Experiences,’ in which the percipient mentally ‘travels’ toanother location while his body remains at rest. This rapidly-developingtechnology has spawned a technological equivalent to the drug culture...”158[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos660214] The apologeticimplication for the possible existence of such technologies in ancient times israther obvious, for such technologies could induce people to believe they havevisited “heaven,” whether “in the body or not,” as the apostle Paul said.159[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos660387]"},{"pageContent":"6. THE REMOTE INDUCTION OF TRANCES, EMOTIONS, SPECIFIC INFORMATION, AND REMOTE“TELEPATHY” As work progressed on the technologies of mind manipulation, it was soondiscovered — via techniques such as the establishment of “beat frequencies” in atarget brain or brains — that emotional states, including deep hypnogogicstates, could be remotely induced without actual electrodes or implants havingto be present in the brain itself. This technique was called RHIC, or “RemoteHypnotic Intracerebral Control.”160[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos660800] The phenomenon wasfirst reported by L.L. Vasilev of the University of Leningrad in the early1930s.161 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos660949] Thus, byproducing beat frequencies in synch with the alpha, beta, theta or delta statesof the brain’s natural functioning, the brain would naturally entrain itself tothat beat frequency, and experience the corresponding emotional state. Thus, asubject could be made open to the possibility of remote suggestion by entraininga beat frequency in the theta cycle range and then beaming “voices” andinstructions to the subject, since the same technology could be used, as we haveseen, to induce a subject to hear actual “voices” in his brain.162[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos661090]There was yet another possibility that emerged from all this as well, and thatwas remote electromagnetic telepathy, or reading a target’s mind or emotionalstates by “deciphering the brain’s magnetic waves.” The project was under waysince 1973 at the Advanced Projects Research Agency (ARPA).163[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos661327]"},{"pageContent":"7. ELECTROMAGNETIC ALTERATION OF DNA Beyond all these suggestive and disturbing possibilities and implications forthe remote electromagnetic manipulation of the mind, however, there is one more,and that is the ability of prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields to alterthe very characteristics of human DNA itself. While not strictly germane to thesubject being discussed here, it is worth noting that researcher Paul Brodeurmaintains unequivocally that since the 1960s “the government and the militaryhave systematically suppressed information about the genetic effects ofmicrowaves in human beings and covered up a number of potentially embarrassingsituations in which such effects have been observed.”164[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos661510] Among the effectsobserved were the long-term permanent damage caused by chromosomal breaks,breaks that in turn were induced by prolonged exposure to such fields.165[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos661682]"},{"pageContent":"8. SECTION SUMMARY At the end of this excursion into modern mind manipulation techniques andtechnologies, what do we have? A short review reveals the apologeticimplications for the accounts alleged of special revelations in ancient times ifsuch a technology is assumed to have existed and to have been used in ancienttimes, for by relatively simple means, the modern techniques and technologiescan remotely induce:> 1. Emotional states of all sorts, from euphoria, anger, hypnogogic> suggestibility, trance, and so on;> 2. Actual perception of “visions” and “voices” with specific information or> instruction;> 3.

And if there existedan “elite” or “elites with agendas” to manipulate mankind into the earlieststages of civilization as was argued in the previous chapter, is there anyevidence to suggest that these technologies were employed to manipulate the mostsocially cohesive force in human history, religion itself?The answer, sadly, is yes."},{"pageContent":"C. THE TORSION TEMPLES OF ANTIQUITY: A PRIMITIVE TECHNOLOGY OF COMMUNICATION ANDSPECIAL REVELATION In seeking to answer the question of whether or not such mind manipulationtechnologies existed and that they were used in ancient times to manipulatereligion itself as a socially cohesive force, our attention must be focused,once again, on “texts,” with the understanding that, in a certain sense,monuments and structures themselves are “texts” to be understood and properlydecoded by the requisite physics and engineering principles. Additionally, ofcourse, we shall have to contend with actual written texts and what they portendin this regard.In a previous book — Babylon’s Banksters: The Alchemy of Deep Physics, HighFinance, and Ancient Religion — I argued for the existence of a globallyextendedfinancial elite that had attached itself to the temples and priesthoods ofantiquity for the purpose of installing a financial monopoly over the privateissuance of monetized debt, and for the purpose of manipulating the bullionpolicies of various empires. As a consequence of this conclusion, I also arguedthat such manipulation would have required — then as now — asecure means ofrapid communication between vast distances. That, in turn, would have requiredthe existence of a hidden technology, or, at the minimum, a technology that wasnot genuinely appreciated as such by modern interpreters.166[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos661870]Fortunately, I did not have to look long nor far to find an engineer who hadtackled precisely this problem, and who had made an amazing discovery, namely,the technology was the ancient temples themselves, and moreover, that technologywas a scalar electromagnetic technology, in short, a radio technology.167[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos662226] The engineer was aGerman professor of engineering, Prof. Dr. Konstantin Meyl, and his research wasnothing less than stunning and sweeping in its implications. How else, he asked,could one make sense of some statements in classical texts that Roman Empirefunctionaries in distant regions of the Empire would “send to the Emperor” forinstructions, and receive an answer at the latest the following night?168[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos662482] Meyl’s answer issimply that there was a technology in play: religious temples.Meyl states the case that ancient temples were actually sophisticated radiotransmitters by posing the classic “engineer’s optimalization problem”:> Let’s to some extent proceed from the knowledge of textbook physics currently> present in high frequency engineering and give a welltrained engineer the> following task, which he should solve systematically and like an engineer. He> should build a transmitter with maximum range at minimum transmitting power,> thus a classic of optimization. Doing so, the material expenditure doesn’t> play a role!> After mature deliberation the engineer will hit upon it that only one solution> exists. He decides on a telegraphy transmitter at the long wave end of the> shortwave band, at f=3 MHz, which corresponds to a wavelength of l=100m. There> less than 1 Watt transmitting power is enough for radio communication once> around the earth….> And he optimizes further. Next the engineer remembers that at high> frequencies, e.g. for microwave radiators, not cables but waveguides are used,> since these make possible a considerably better degree of effectiveness. In> the case of the waveguide the stray fields are reduced by alignment and> concentration of the fields in the inside of the conductor. In the case of> antennas, however, the fields scatter to the outside and cause considerable> stray losses. He draws the conclusion that his transmitter should be built as> a tuned cavity and not as an antenna!> As a result the engineer puts a building without windows in the countryside> with the enormous dimensions of 50 m length (=l/2) and 25 m (=l/4)> respectively 12.5 mm (=l/8) width. The height he calculates according to the> Golden Proportion to increase the scalar wave part. Those approximately are> the dimensions of the Cella without windows of Greek temples.> For the operation of such a transmitter in antiquity apparently the noise> power of the cosmic radiation was sufficient, which arrived at the earth> starting from the sun and the planets. By increasing the floor space also the> collected field energy and the transmitting power could be increased, so that> also from the perspective of the power supply, the temple with the largest> possible wavelength at the same time promised the largest transmitting power,> so at least in antiquity.> Our engineer further determines that he will switch the carrier frequency on> and off at a predetermined clock pulse. Thus he decides for radiotelegraphy.> The advantage of this technique is a maximum of the increase of the reception> range. For that the signals at the transmitter have to be coded and at the> receiver again deciphered. By means of the encryption of the contents these> are accessible only to the “insiders,” who know the code; prerequisite for the> emerging of hermeticism and eventually a question of power!169> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos662715] With these insights in hand, Meyl examined various ancient temples, andcalculated the resonant frequencies of the structures themselves, under theunderstanding that the structure itself was the waveguide.The results — while I did not comment on them in Babylon’s Banksters — wereastounding, and here it is necessary to comment on them, because they aredirectly germane to the thesis being examined here, namely that these templesmight also have functioned not only as transmitters and receivers formicrowaves, but as mind manipulation environments. For the Temple of Zeus atOlympia, for example, Meyl calculated the frequency of the building to be 5megahertz (MHz).170 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos662951]For the temple of Athena, it was 7.5 MHz.171[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos663162] For the Temple ofApollo at Corinth, 9 MHz.172[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos663373] For the Temple ofVenus and Roma, 6.8 MHz.173[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos663584]Why are these results so interesting? Because if one understands the laws ofharmonics, they are all harmonics of the alpha and theta wave states of thebrain! A “harmonic” is simply a multiple of a number, and thus, the Temple ofZeus, resonant to 5 MHz, is six orders of magnitude, that is, one million timesmore than 5 cycles per second, which is within the theta stage of brain waveactivity, that stage associated with a hypnogogic state.174[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos663792] For the Temple ofAthena, resonant to 7.5 MHz, this would be a resonance at six orders ofmagnitude greater, exactly halfway between the alpha state of the brain, at 8–13cycles, a state associated with a relaxed and alert state, and the theta state,again from 4–7 cycles per second. For the Temple of Apollo at 9 MHz, again theresonance is to the alpha state of the brain, and for the Temple of Venus andRoma, the theta state!To put it succinctly, in those cases examined by Meyl, not only are we dealingwith microwave transmitters and receivers, but with structures that appear tohave been deliberately designed to induce alpha or theta, or both states ofmind, states of “relaxed alertness,” or a “hypnogogic” state, or a state of mindsomewhere between the two! The same technology, based on pulsed radio waves, wasalso engineered to produce various emotional states for anyone inside thestructures!So, in answer to the question of whether such technology existed, and whether itwas ever deployed to manipulate the mental and emotional environment, our answermust be a tentative “yes.” But was that technology ever used in more overt waysand displays to manipulate the minds of men? Was it ever used to mold an entirereligious consciousness?To answer that question, we must turn to the texts themselves, and to theprovocative analysis of the husband and wife team of British researchersChristian and Barbara Joy O’Brien, and to the very disturbing questions forreligious apologetics that they raise."},{"pageContent":"D. THE RELIGION REVEALERS: O’BRIEN’S TECHNOLOGICAL CONSIDERATION OF THEREVELATIONS OF YHWH AND THE TORAH With the existence of such admittedly primitive but nonetheless effectivetechnologies in ancient times, an existence tied quite directly to the temples —for the technology was the temples — the speculative possibility arises thatfamous (or depending on one’s lights, infamous) revelations were the products ofsome sort of technological manipulation by an elite. One need only recall thatall that was required to produce “out of the body experiences,” in the case ofsome “mind machines,” was an interference of two waves of different frequency toproduce beat frequencies in a brain that would produce a requisiteemotional-physiological state. In view of “the techniques and technologies ofspecial revelation,” these potentialities, while highly speculative to be sure,do open the doors to apologetical difficulties posed by famous instances of“special revelation,” such as Paul’s “vision” of Christ on the road to Damascus,or Daniel’s and Joseph’s roles in the Old Testament interpreting dreams fortheir masters: were they dreams they themselves induced and subsequently“interpreted”? As noted in my book Babylon’s Banksters, the presence of ashadowy financial elite within the precincts of the ancient temple, an elitemoreover ready and willing to manipulate religion to its own ends, raises theapologetical and interpretive bar substantially, especially if one entertainsthe possibility that something of a lost technology and technique of mindmanipulation were preserved by that elite.But one need not only turn to technological speculations to perceive theenormous difficulties posed by mind manipulation in the context of religion, foras was previously observed, these constitute but one half of the total picture,the other half being the techniques of mind manipulation. And here, according toBritish researchers Christian O’Brien and his wife Barbara Joy, one need go nofurther than the Yahweh, or Jehovah, of the first five books of the OldTestament to see the use both of technologies and techniques for the totalenslavement of a people, and their turning from normal moral constraints to awillingness to commit wholesale slaughter on behalf of their “divine master,”Yahweh.This is not to say that the O’Briens themselves view Yahweh’s technologicaldisplays and his behavior toward the Israelites as a manifestation of suchtechnologies and techniques. In fact, they nowhere mention “mind control” or“mind manipulation” in connection with their examination of Yahweh’s characterand behavior. Nonetheless, it is a disturbing possibility fraught withapologetical implications that clearly emerges from their examination, so itwill be reviewed carefully here.Before reviewing the O’Briens’ examination of Yahweh’s character and behavior,however, it is worth pausing to take note of the assumptions and the basicmethodology that form the context of their interpretation. There are four basicassumptions and methods driving their interpretation of the Yahweh of the Torah,and particularly, of the book of Exodus:> 1. There is an ancient elite manipulating the events of human history and> religion operating behind the scenes. This elite is connected to and composed> of members of the “Anunnaki,” a race of “shining ones” whom the O’Briens view> as the genetic “cousins” of modern-day Homo sapiens sapiens, and indeed, whom> they view as having genetically manipulated the latter species into existence.> Some of that elite rebelled and broke ranks with the rest, interfering in> human affairs in a proscribed fashion. For the O’Briens, the Yahweh of the> first five books of the Old Testament is precisely one such individual> rebelling, fallen, “shining one.”> 2. The Shining Ones, representing an advanced, genetically related race to> mankind, also possessed an advanced technology which, in Yahweh’s case, they> believe was used to cow and coerce the Israelites into unhesitating,> unquestioning obedience to Yahweh and his plans for conquest.> 3. In their examination of the character, behavior, and actions of Yahweh in> the Torah, the O’Briens subject him to an unhesitating and thoroughly critical> examination based on normal standards of human decency and morality, and find> him thoroughly wanting in compassion, love, and exhibiting classical symptoms> of paranoia, schizophrenia, and a genocidal blood and war lust comparable to a> Stalin or a Hitler.> 4. In their examination, the O’Briens make it clear that they believe the name> “Yahweh” itself might be a titular usage, similar to “the Lord Mayor of> London,” a usage that is not therefore a proper name, but the name of a> position within a hierarchy that different occupants fill at different times,> thus accounting — in the O’Briens’ minds — for the vast changes of character> and behavior from the Yahweh of the Torah to the Yahweh of, for example,> prophets such as Isaiah. It is best to cite their own words here:> > This Yahweh was only one of the leaders of the Shining Ones. The fact that> > he was always defined as ‘Leader’ — whether he was taking part in the> > establishment of the Garden in Eden; pretending to make Abraham sacrifice> > his eldest son on a woodpile; handing a Code of Laws to Hammurabi;> > militarily training the Israelites for the conquest of Canaan; or> > sacrificing the Jewish remnants to the cruel ravages of Babylon — has led to> > much confusion.> > The participant in all these activities was not a single entity.175> > [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos663944]> > Our review of the O’Briens’ examination of Yahweh will concentrate on these fourareas. In order to demonstrate the close comparison of some of Yahweh’s behaviortoward the Israelites and that of various mind manipulation techniques, thatreview will of necessity have to be as comprehensive as possible."},{"pageContent":"1. YAHWEH AS ONE OF THE SHINING ONES As a representative of the “Shining Ones” whom the O’Briens believe to have beena genetically related race to mankind, and indeed, its ultimate geneticengineers, the assumption that Yahweh is a representative of that race — andtherefore not God or “a god” in any sense — is therefore a study that wouldyield considerable information about that race. As they put it:> From a detailed study of this Yahweh, we ought to be able to formulate our> ideas on the true characteristics of the Shining Ones — their physical> attributes, their temperaments, their technological attainments, and the> nature of their relationships with the humans with whom they lived and worked> — in much greater depth than we have been able to achieve hitherto.176> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos664239] That, however, did not come without a caveat, for the character of Yahweh — ifindeed he was one of the Shining Ones to begin with — was hardly typical of themas a group:> And yet, we have an uneasy feeling about this Yahweh, and must enter a caveat> — he may not have been typical of his race. He was bellicose and vindictive,> and appears to have been determined to conquer the peoples of the Middle East> by force.177 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos664447] This reading of Yahweh as a vindictive, bellicose conqueror is thecharacteristic that most identifies him as one of the rebelling Shining Ones, acharacteristic that will be examined more closely in the second part of thisbook.So odd, so unusual is Yahweh’s behavior when compared to the rest of the ShiningOnes that the O’Briens question whether he — and they — are in fact geneticallyrelated to humanity at all. “This study of Yahweh may help us to solve theperplexing and disturbing question of whether” he even “belonged to our genus —perhaps Homo sapiens sapiens sapiens — or some other genus with which we are notfamiliar.”178 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos664588]"},{"pageContent":"2. A GENETIC AGENDA? For the O’Briens, the answer to that question is a tentative “yes, the characterof Yahweh belongs to a related genus,” for as they point out, Yahweh appears tohave some sort of hidden genetic agenda with respect to the ancient Hebrews, anagenda that is never quite fully revealed, nor one that is ever quite fullyconcealed either:> ...before we discuss the enigma [of Yahweh] proper, it must be stressed that> the building of the Hebrew nation was achieved by a deliberate process of> selection which stretched back to Noah. His family was selected for survival> after the Flood; and Terah’s family was selected from the Semitic peoples of> Ur; and out of it Abraham was chosen, over his brothers, for reasons that we> can only guess at. Possibly they were genetic; but another aspect may have> been that Sarah, Abraham’s wife, was barren — and this may have given the> opportunity for another remarkable genetic opportunity.179> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos664796] Later on, of course, another selection was made with Jacob over Esau, this time,note the O’Briens, “by a somewhat underhanded manoeuvre,”180[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos664951] referring to Jacobplaying a trick on his father Isaac, and receiving Esau’s blessing in hisplace.181 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos665101]All this, to the O’Briens, is suggestive of a hidden genetic agenda:> The purity of the strain, which Yahweh required, continued to be carefully> monitored. He was determined that the line through the Patriarchs from Abraham> should continue as he wished it — and he was looking quite a long way into the> future. Five hundred years were to pass before he was satisfied that he had> achieved the Nation that he wanted.182> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos665253] The implication — even though they do not spell it out in so many words — isclear, for if Yahweh was intent upon conquest, as they believe, then onepossible reason for the constant genetic manipulation might be to create aleader-caste with the requisite warrior characteristics. That there are otherpossibilities for this hidden genetic agenda will be explored in the second partof this book."},{"pageContent":"3. YAHWEH’S “PILLAR OF FIRE:” THE TECHNOLOGICAL COMPONENT Central to their thesis that Yahweh, far from being “God” or “a god,” is a realphysical, humanoid creature is the pillar of fire, the technology by which andfrom which he leads, and intimidates, the Hebrews.> We are told that he led them from inside an airborne ‘pillar of cloud’ by day,> which became a ‘pillar of fire’ by night.

THE THREATS BEGIN: THE CARROT, THE STICK, AND OTHER TECHNIQUES Having thus interpreted the “pillar of cloud and fire” as a technology, the wayis now open for the O’Briens to follow up on all the implications that such aninterpretation poses, and the first of these is the meeting of Yahweh and theHebrews at Mount Horeb:> The people were now given three days to rest, to wash their clothes — in> preparation for the awful prospect of meeting Yahweh. Until then, they had had> to rely on second- and third-hand reports of this Presence through Moses and> their Elders, although the sight of the aerial craft184> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos665690] must have been a> continual reminder that they were under the direction of an unusual form of> leadership.> The setting for this dramatic meeting, and the stage-management of it, must> have been magnificent.

The threats had started!> (Ex. 19:12–13) “Whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death; no hand> shall touch him, but he shall either be stoned, or pierced through; beast or> man, he shall not live.”> At that time Moses was unfamiliar with Yahweh’s long-range methods of killing,> and could only think in terms of stones, spears or arrows — he was to learn> differently.> At Horeb the Israelites had their first taste of Yahweh’s powers, the> strictness of his orders, and of the penalties for disobedience.

As a modern electric fence is used to control> cattle, so it might have had its own physical protection against intruders —> perhaps a lethal barrier. We incline to this view because of the reference to> ‘beast or man.’ Such stringent regulations would have been unnecessary for the> stray goat or dog unless there was physical danger for them on the mountain.> We begin to understand that this was no mountain Eden with the Lord of Spirits> strolling amongst his people; this was not Enlil walking through his> plantations while men followed his benign instructions. Here at Horeb, Man was> under a very different regime.185> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos665861] Interestingly enough, during the era of modern mind manipulation research,research was also undertaken in forms of crowd control that involvedestablishing invisible electromagnetic barriers that could — without the aid ofelectric fences — inflict terrible pain or potentially even death on thoseattempting to cross or breach it:> There is, however, a small portion of [a] (Defense Intelligence Agency) report> which remains classified. It clearly indicates that efforts to develop> microwave radiation as an antipersonnel weapon have been underway in the> United States for some years.

Indeed, it is thisone fact that most strongly suggests a technology is in play at Horeb, beyondthe “normal” pillar of cloud and fire.It is at Horeb that Yahweh’s character and behavior — for the O’Briens — showsitself for what it really is, and it is hardly that of even a relativelyenlightened human being, much less a “god.” For example, there is the Covenantitself:> The Covenant between Yahweh and his People was struck at Horeb, and the fact> is recorded in Exodus — but we have to wait until the Book of Leviticus before> finding out the terms of this Bargain. We shall, however, record its terms> here because, without an understanding of what had been agreed, it is> impossible to appreciate the vicissitudes that Israel underwent in the> Wilderness through Yahweh’s interpretation of its clauses.187> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos666294] The O’Briens quip that “Yahweh’s verbal interpretation of how he intended tokeep his side of the bargain should have given Moses many sleepless nights.”188[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos666507]Then come the “Blessings”:> (Lev 26:3–13): “If you follow my laws and faithfully observe my commandments,> I will grant you rains in their season so that the earth shall yield its> produce and the trees of the field their fruit. Your threshing shall overtake> the vintage, and your vintage shall overtake the sowing; you shall eat your> fill of bread and dwell securely in your land.> I will grant peace in the land, and you shall lie down untroubled by anyone; I> will give the land respite from vicious beasts, and no sword shall cross your> land. You shall give chase to your enemies, and they shall fall before you by> the sword. Five of you shall give chase to a hundred, and a hundred of you> shall give chase to ten thousand; your enemies shall fall before you by the> sword.> I will look with favour upon you, and make you fertile and multiply; and I> will maintain my covenant with you. You shall eat grain long stored, and you> shall have to clear out the old to make room for the new.> I will establish my abode in your midst, and I will not spurn you. I will be> ever present in your midst; I will be your God, and you shall be my people. I> the Lord your God who brought you out from the land of the Egyptians to be> their slaves no more, who broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk> erect.”189 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos666657] Of course, all these blessings can come quite naturally from God. But — and thisis the problem posed by the assumption of sophisticated technology — they cancome equally from a technology capable of weather manipulation, and notably,such technological sophistication would also be a “multiplier” effect inmilitary terms, easily capable of offsetting overwhelming numerical superiorityof an enemy. The O’Briens’ point once again, while subtle, is nonetheless clear:such statements are not conclusively indicative of anything divine at all, forthere are technological possibilities of interpretation.Again, the same two possibilities exist, and while reading the followingpassage, the reader is reminded to read it from the standpoint of someone who isin possession of such a technology dictating terms to someone who is not:> (Lev. 26:14–33): But if you do not obey me and do not observe all these> commandments, if you reject my laws and spurn my norms, so that you do not> observe all my commandments and you break my covenant, I in turn will do this> to you: I will wreak misery upon you — consumption and fever, which cause the> eyes to pine and the body to languish; you shall sow your seed to no purpose,> for your enemies shall eat it. I will set my face against you; you shall be> routed by your enemies, and your foes shall dominate you. You shall flee> though none pursues. Let us pause and look at that last statement more closely: “You shall fleethough none pursues.” Such a statement, given the technological perspective oftheir overall interpretation, could be very indicative of a mind manipulationtechnology. To continue:> And if for all that, you do not obey me, I will go on disciplining you> sevenfold for your sins, and I will break your proud glory. I will make your> skies like iron and your earth like copper, so that your strength shall be> spent to no purpose. Your land shall not yield its produce, nor shall the> trees of it yield their fruit. This, of course, sounds suspiciously familiar, for the “starvation” tactic wastried by the gods of the Sumerian pantheon long before, to bring down humanpopulation!190 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos666879] Yahwehrages on:> And if you remain hostile toward me and refuse to obey me, I will go on> smiting you sevenfold for your sins.

Your land shall become a desolation and your cities a ruin.191> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos667111] If Yahweh was one of the “Shining Ones” as spoken of in some ancient cuneiformtexts as the O’Briens believe, then at least his rages and threats are true toform, for in the Atra-Hasis, the Mesopotamian Flood epic, as the gods are tryingto starve humanity into non-existence, one may read that “They served up adaughter for a meal, served up a son for food.”192[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos667341]For the O’Briens the covenant becomes — just as it does for many devout Jews andChristians — a revelation of Yahweh’s character. The only problem is, what theysee revealed there is hardly “God” nor even “a god,” but something far worse:> We find this Covenant a most disturbing document on four counts:> 1. This was not a freely negotiated agreement between two parties in which> both of them understood the full implications of their consent. It was> dictated by Yahweh, and accepted by the Israelites in a state of euphoric> bewilderment under the influence of the dramatic and, to them, supernatural> happenings at Mount Sinai. They were a simple and trusting people who had no> concept of the lengths to which Yahweh would go to ensure their compliance to> his will.> The ambiance of the manner in which the Israelite agreement was obtained was a> form of duress and, in civilized terms, would have nullified the Covenant when> Yahweh’s actions, and demands, became oppressive. As far as we know, the> common people were never told that one of the requisites of the Agreement was> that they should act as Yahweh’s troops in the conquest of the Near East.> It makes no difference that the consent of the Elders was obtained during that> visit to the mountaintop. Even there, Moses seemed to be surprised at Yahweh’s> forbearance — ‘Yet he did not raise his hand against the leaders of the> Israelites; they beheld God, and they ate and they drank.’> The signing of an Agreement would have been followed, traditionally, by food> and drink. But why should Moses have even considered that Yahweh might raise> his hand against the Elders on such a visit? Surely, only if there had been> some altercation, or if there had been reluctance on the part of the Elders,> and pressure had been applied to make them sign.> Israel did not ask to be taken out of Egypt, but allowed themselves to be led> out in the knowledge that, although unpleasant things were happening to them> where they were, worse might follow if they refused to go.> 2. The sanctions proposed by Yahweh, in the event of the Covenant being broken> by Israel, were not such as would be acceptable to civilized communities. To> threaten fever and consumption; terror; the killing of children by wild> beasts; pestilence that would strike the weak and defenceless as well as the> strong; reduction to cannibalism through extremes of hunger; and the utter> desolation of the country, must appall all but the most depraved and> power-hungry. In the Curse, there is an essence of vindictiveness and> cold-blooded indifference to suffering that is redolent of the worst type of> human despot.> 3. The world’s major religions all have common factors.... They are based on> love, tolerance, justice, care for the weak and suffering, and just rewards> for the good life; and, perhaps, a hell of their own making for those who> deliberately choose an evil path. But in Yahweh’s reprisals, the good were to> suffer with the bad; the innocent with the guilty; and the little children,> and the frail, with the strong and resistant.> 4. But, perhaps the most disturbing factor of all is that, since those days,> history has seen a series of events which have all the trappings of these> declared reprisals. ...193> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos667516] As a result of these observations, the O’Briens conclude with what may beconsidered “the Gnostic question”: “[At] some point... we shall have to considerwhether Yahweh was evil: whether the Israelites were right when they cried outin the Wilderness — ‘Yahweh hates us!’ We shall have to consider whether theCathars, in the Middle Ages, were right in declaring Yahweh to be the Devil!”194[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos667729]"},{"pageContent":"A. COWING THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND PUBLIC EXECUTIONS The O’Briens then examine one incident — that of the meeting of the Israeliteswith Yahweh in the “tabernacle” — from the standpoint of technological displayscoupled with public executions, a classic of despotic behavior:> We visualize the high canvas wall of the east entrance to the courtyard being> rolled back to reveal the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.

And Moses said, ‘By this you> shall know that it was the Lord who sent me to do all these things; that they> are not of my devising: if these men die as all men do, if their lot be the> common fate of all mankind, it was not the Lord who sent me.

More importantly,the admission of such a context also argues that such demonstrations were inpart technological, and in part psychological and sociological techniques tokeep the Hebrews in a state of fear and compliance. In short, they argue thatsuch incidents — while revelatory of his character — are also possiblydemonstrations of mind manipulation techniques by the old tried and true methodof all despots: terrorism."},{"pageContent":"B. AN INDEFENSIBLE ACT: IMPALINGS To drive these points home, the O’Briens refer to one final set of incidentsfrom Numbers 25:3–5 (citing the Jerusalem Bible translation):> “With Israel thus committed to the Baal of Peor, the anger of Yahweh blazed> out against them.> “Yahweh said to Moses, ‘Take all the leaders of the people. Impale them for> Yahweh here in the sun; then the burning anger of Yahweh will turn away from> Israel.’ Moses said to the Judges in Israel, ‘Every one of you must put to> death those of his people who have committed themselves to the Baal of Peor.’ The O’Briens mince no words in what they think of this horrible sentence:> If we are correct in our interpretation of impaling, this was the most> barbarous, and inhuman, form of fatal torture known to man. Its description,> let alone its practice, should have no place in a civilized document....> We cannot stress too strongly that by this one declaration of intent, Yahweh> put himself beyond the pale of civilized behavior; all his cruel acts, all his> murders, were insignificant beside this one, appalling judgement.

AN INHUMAN FACE? What was the source of all this inhumanity? The source, according to theO’Briens, was very simple: Yahweh was not human.

THE TABERNACLE: YAHWEH’S MOBILE PALACE But was Yahweh in fact a physical, real being?To this the O’Briens answer a resounding “yes” and point to the Tabernacleitself as the strongest argument for this view:> Whatever the reason, the expressed desire for a ground-based dwelling is the> most telling factor in the argument in favour of the physical nature of Yahweh> — that his craft was not suitable for a lengthy sojourn in the Wilderness.> In our own environment, much can be surmised of a man, or a family, from the> house in which they live.

They come to anastonishing, and disturbing, conclusion:> We have already made it clear that we consider Yahweh to have been a solid> physical Being with appetites that required attention like any human; and such> a view is consistent with the accounts of the life-styles of the [Anunnaki].> We do not believe that it would be rational to ignore the evidence that points> to the Tent being a functional desert dwelling for a Being requiring food and> drink, a place in which to work and confer, and a private sanctuary in which> to rest.

THE URIM AND THUMMIN: MORE TECHNOLOGY? As a final argument that Yahweh has access to extraordinary technologies bywhich he intimidates, and stays in contact with, the Hebrews, the O’Briensmention Aaron’s Urim and Thummim, and give a uniquely Sumerian explanation forthem:> By the time of Saul, the terms Urim and Thummim had become so debased that> they were used for the casting of lots; they were pressed into use as an> oracle in the absence of Yahweh, and our tossing of ‘heads’ or ‘tails’ is> possibly a relic of this ancient practice.> The important point, here, is that the later Hebrew priests used Urim and> Thummim as a symbolic method of communicating with Yahweh, even as dried> yarrow stalks, in combination with the I Ching, have been used by the Chinese.> At the time of Saul, they may have been small sticks, pebbles or dice (all of> these have been suggested) with ‘yes’ and ‘no’ connotations, which were picked> out, at random, from the pocket of the ephod.> The practice may have been a tribal memory of a more technical method used by> Aaron for communication with Yahweh, the instruments of which were no longer> available.

The episode concerns Aaron and Miriamcriticizing Moses. At this point, Yahweh, hovering above in his pillar of cloudand fire, immediately orders the three to appear before him in the Tent ofMeeting. The technological possibilities are evident from the narrative,according to the O’Briens:> Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses, and Yahweh heard it and, peremptorily,> ordered them to the Tent of Meeting.

THE SHINING ONES AND THE POSSIBLE AGENDAS So what, at this point, do we have? And how does all this analysis of Yahweh andhis behavior fit into the context of mind manipulation? And what, if any,agendas does it imply? In order to understand the O’Briens’ argument it is firstnecessary to understand that they assume the basic historicity of the accountthat they reinterpret. Once this is done, their argument boils down to fourpoints:> 1. Yahweh is a physical being, not a spiritual one, or a deity in the> conventional sense;> 2. As such, Yahweh is also apparently a long-lived being, whom they interpret> in consonance with similar long-lived beings in the ancient Sumerian tablets.> This longevity accounts for his willingness to forego immediate conquest of> Canaan in favor of letting the older generation “die off”;> 3.

This treatment consisted of endless days — usuallyup to 30 — of endless sleep, induced by a potent cocktail of sedativesadministered several times a day, along with a regimen of electroshock “therapy”that was administered at least three times a day.215[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos672326] His goal was toinduce essentially a tabula rasa in the mind of his patients, which could thenbe remolded with behavioral patterns derived from “psychic driving.”For as much as 16 hours a day, while patients lay in a drug-induced “stupor”again brought about by a potent cocktail of sedatives, patients would hearmessages played over and over, repeatedly, as they tried to rest. This beganwith several weeks’ “treatment” of this process, with the initial stage being a“negative” stage where the patient was played messages reinforcing theirfailures and guilt.216[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos672537] After this “guiltreinforcement” phase, Cameron would then switch them over to another two to fiveweeks of “positive reinforcement,” utilizing the same drug-induced stupor andrepeated recorded messages designed to induce new patterns of behavior.217[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos672686]It takes only a little imagination to see how in the hands of some religiouscults a kind of “reverse depatterning” and “psychic driving” occurs, utilizingnot drug-induced sleep, but rather the reverse: intense sleep deprivation andprolonged exertions of physical work coupled with always being under thescrutiny and never out of the sight of the “depatterner,” with the slogans ofthe “cult leader” repeated over and over again to the dazed victims, reinforcingtheir unquestioning obedience in constant repetition, like a religious litanyalmost, and his “love” for the cult followers in spite of the complete lack ofactual normal demonstrations thereof. In either case, the methods are rathersimilar to the methods recorded by the first books of the Old Testament: arelentless driving of a whole people, a breakdown of will, endless rehearsals oflove-and-threats, the end result of which is similar — a breakdown of normalpatterns of behavior and emotion.There is a final suggestive sign that perhaps these or similar techniques werein play by Yahweh toward the Hebrews, and that is the well-known Stockholmsyndrome. According to the article on Stockholm syndrome in the onlineencyclopedia Wikipedia, there are four conditions that are the sine qua non forthe syndrome to occur in its victims:> • Hostages who develop Stockholm syndrome often view the perpetrator as giving> life by simply not taking it. In this sense, the captor becomes the person in> control of the captive’s basic needs for survival and the victim’s life> itself.> • The hostage endures isolation from other people and has only the captor’s> perspective available.

The captive judges it safer to align with the> perpetrator, endure the hardship of captivity, and comply with the captor than> to resist and face murder.> • The captive sees the perpetrator as showing some degree of kindness.> Kindness serves as the cornerstone of the Stockholm syndrome; the condition> will not develop unless the captor exhibits it in some form toward the> hostage.... if perpetrators show some kindness, victims will submerge the> anger they feel in response to the terror and concentrate on the captors’> “good side” to protect themselves.218> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos672827]It takes little imagination to see the key elements of the syndrome in thetechniques and technologies — the public executions with reassurances of hislove — displayed by Yahweh.Does all of this point conclusively to an agenda in play?Of course not. However, if one grants the proposition of a surviving elite fromthat ancient war, then religion would surely be one of the techniques employedto create suitable climates of opinion, and certainly one of the techniques andtools used to embark upon campaigns of wholesale slaughter and conquest in thename of a “god” who sanctioned it. At the minimum, viewed in this admittedlysecular light, the techniques displayed by Yahweh in the books of Exodus andNumbers have about them the all too familiar and haunting similarity to thetechniques used by modern mind manipulators and cult leaders. They are abusivebehaviors, as a friend put it to me recently, that would land such a tyrant injail today.219 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos673144]Or worse, perhaps before a war crimes tribunal for crimes against humanity.Whatever one makes of the views of the O’Briens, one thing cannot be ignored,and that is, they have raised the bar of the task of religious apologeticsconsiderably."},{"pageContent":"Four ELITE WITH AGENDAS: CONCLUSIONS TO PART ONE 029 [images/00029.jpg]> “At length this universal knowledge was diuvided into several parts, and> lessened in its vigour and power.

Thus, trade could be carried out between> these two disparate parts of the world, the policies were in a certain sense> an inevitable consequence of that trade.

In short, what is being created, from earliest times, is an> international financial class of “bullion brokers,” or as we would call them> now, bankers. A significant question now occurs: Is it possible that, rather> than such a class having emerged as a consequence of such governmental> policies and trade, that the converse is true? Is it possible that there> existed such a class of “international bullion brokers” who created these> policies in various parts of the world, policies which would enhance their own> power and wealth? If so, then how did they achieve and orchestrate this?222> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos674834] With the research of Knight and Butler in hand — with their own conclusions thatsuch an elite existed — then we are now in a position to answer those questionswith a decisive “yes.” But there is a caveat: to assume the existence of such anelite in megalithic times, while certainly indicated by the research of Knightand Butler, does not prove the existence of the same elite engineering bullionpolicies millennia later, much less does it prove the continuity between thetwo.There is, however, an important factor to bear in mind here, one indicated bythe ancient texts themselves, from the Sumerian Kings’ list, to the genealogiesof the Torah, to the Egyptian texts, and that is the extraordinary longevityclaimed for those “gods” who came down and midwifed human civilization intoexistence. Under such conditions, and even allowing for the possibility that thealleged longevity of these “gods” is greatly exaggerated, one is nonethelessleft with the possibility that under conditions of longevity of even hundreds ofyears, it would be much easier for such an elite to maintain cohesion ofpersonnel and ideological outlook through such a length of time. The assumptionis less difficult than one might imagine, for as Knight and Butler observe, theestablishment of accurate weights and measures was a necessary step to theestablishment of international trade, and thus, the activity between the twopoles separated by some millennia is consistent, and this would suggest that oneis indeed in the presence not only of a continuous ideology and policy, but inthe presence of a continuous elite.If these speculative propositions be granted, then the question I posed inBabylon’s Banksters is answered, though the answer is an extraordinarilydisturbing one: the elite preexisted by millennia the bullion policies that cameto be in evidence with the rise of private monopoly issuance of money as debtand the bullion policies of the states issuing it in classical times. In thatcontext, one must allow for another possibility that was also outlined inBabylon’s Banksters, namely, that the subsequent rise of an elite opposed to thestate issuance of money as debt-free receipts on the surpluses of the statewarehouse might not represent the rise of a new elite with a new agenda, butrather, the final break of an elite that existed coterminously with the onebehind the establishment of weights and measures, and with which it made commoncause for a period. But howsoever one slices it, one does appear to be in thepresence of at least one such elite with a consistent agenda over a great periodof time that perhaps fragmented later into two opposing ones, or perhaps twoelites at the outset, making common cause for a time.There is another factor in play, and that is, at the end of this period when onediscovers this elite — or these elites — within the religious temples ofantiquity, and involved in the issuance of money. Very simply put this meansthat this elite — or elites — is also involved in the manipulation of religion,and thus, it is involved simultaneously with the manipulation of two powerfulinstitutions for the creation and maintenance of social cohesion: finance andreligion.In the case of the temple, we have seen that at least some rudimentarytechnology of communication existed in the form of some of those ancienttemples, raising the possibility that many of them might have been covertlyconceived for that purpose. Again, this is a likely activity for such an eliteto undertake, both to manipulate and coordinate financial policy over largedistances, and to manipulate and control “revelations” and “oracles.” In thecase of Yahweh, we have seen disturbing indications of at least a technique ofmind and social manipulation in play reminiscent of the Stockholm syndrome andof other techniques explored by the CIA, if not of an outright technology (adebatable proposition on any view).Which brings us back to Koldewey’s conundrum, for one of the things he noted inhis explorations of the “Sirrush” mystery was that apparently it had to be areal creature because the priests were tending it. Given the apparent chimericalnature of this creature — if real — this suggests that there may have beenanother possible agenda going on as well in ancient times: geneticmanipulation..."},{"pageContent":"II.

While the modern debate ragedover ethical issues and the rights of private corporations to patent variousgenes and processes, the race itself pitted two powerful minds — the publicHuman Genome Project’s Francis Collins, and the private corporation Celera’sCraig Venter — in a race that came, quite literally, right down to a brokered“tie” engineered by the administration of former American President BillClinton.Here, as elsewhere, the modern lessons afford a template by which to interpretthe records of the past, for a similar race was apparently held in ancienttimes, and if the lessons of the contemporary one are any indicator, the ancientresults are rife with a potentially horrifying implication. But before we canstate clearly what that implication is, a closer, though necessarily cursorylook, at the modern race and all its implied technologies and legal issues is inorder."},{"pageContent":"A. AN OVERVIEW OF THE MODERN GENOME WAR: THE RACE BETWEEN THE HUMAN GENOMEPROJECT AND CRAIG VENTER’S CELERA CORPORATION “In hindsight, it is hard to imagine there would have been a race to sequencethe human genome without Craig Venter.”225[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos675921] While it isimpossible and indeed unnecessary to recount in detail the race between CraigVenter’s private Celera Corporation and the public Human Genome Project headedby Dr. Francis Collins, some brief overview of that race is necessary, ifnothing else than to highlight the magnitude of the task, and the technologiesand techniques that eventually accomplished it, for these in turn will provide abasis to unlock and possibly decode some astonishing assertions in some veryancient cuneiform tablets.The genome is often described as “the book of life,” and indeed, the analogy ofa book is quite apropos to describe the way the DNA helix works. “Imagine,” saysauthor Matt Ridley, “that the genome is a book.”> There are twenty-three chapters, called CHROMOSOMES.> Each chapter contains several thousand stories, called GENES.> Each story is made up of paragraphs, called EXONS, which are inter-> rupted by advertisements, called INTRONS.> Each paragraph is made up of words, called CODONS.> Each word is written in letters, called BASES.> > > > > > There are one billion words in the book, which makes it longer than 1,000> volumes the size of this one, or as long as 800 Bibles. If I read the genome> out to you at the rate of one word per second for eight hours a day, it would> take me a century. If I wrote out the human genome, one letter per millimeter,> my text would be as long as the River Danube. This is a gigantic document, an> immense book, a recipe of extravagant length, and it all fits inside the> mircroscopic nucleus of a tiny cell that fits easily upon the head of a> pin.226 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos676102]To appreciate the magnitude of mapping the entire human genome, we need tounderstand the “bases” that comprise the “words” or codons. These words arecomposed of never more, and never less, than three bases or “letters,” A, C, Gand T, which stand for the proteins adenine, cutosine, guanine, and thymine. Thebasic “grammar” of these letters is that A pairs only with T, and G only withC.227 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos676353]Thus, “to make a complementary strand therefore brings back the original text.So the sequence ACGT becomes TGCA in the copy, which transcribes back to ACGT inthe copy of the copy. This enables DNA to replicate indefinitely, yet stillcontain the same information.”228[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos676501] But in the midst ofall this microscopic complexity, there lurks a mystery, and it may be asignificant one for our purposes. As James Shreeve puts it, “There are a lot ofextra letters in the genome, sloppily referred to as ‘junk DNA,’ which do notspell out protein recipes but may serve some other purpose, perhaps vital,perhaps not.”229 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos676652] Inother words, a significant portion of the human genome contains genes for whichbiologists and geneticists cannot divine any function whatsoever. Indeed, whatwas so unusual about the human genome as distinguished from any other specieswas the sheer amount of this “junk DNA,” for the human genome, consisting ofover a billion such “letters,” was mostly comprised of this “so-called junk,possibly without any biological purpose at all.”230[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos676826]But as James Shreeve observes,> “Junk” is a misnomer: although protein-coding genes account for less than 3> percent of the DNA in the human genome, inferring that the rest is worthless> is like saying there is no value in the deserts of the Middle East because> they are composed mostly of sand and only a little bit of oil. The fact is, we> don’t know what purposes lie hidden in that alleged junk. We do know, however,> that some of it performs the vital function of regulating when a gene is> turned on or off. Without those switches, there would be no difference between> a liver cell, a brain cell, or a cell in your big toe, and we would all be a> dysfunctional chaos of overexpressed [sic] protein.231> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos676976] In other words, the so-called “junk DNA” functioned as a kind of “computeralgorithm” telling the rest of the code when to execute certain functions in theprogram, and when not to. But that still left the all-important questions, wheredid it come from? Why is there so much of it in the human genome by comparisonto other species?But “junk DNA” played an important role in the “genome war,” for it wasprecisely because of these “regulatory regions” that James Watson, codiscovererof the double helix with Francis Crick, decided to go after the entire sequenceof the human genome.232[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos677172] The enormity of thetask, however, meant that the project would take — or so the thinking ran atthat time — a great deal of time and effort, years, if not even almost a decade.Enter Dr. Craig Venter, and his private Celera Corporation, founded for theexpress purpose of mapping the entire human genome. In May of 1998, Venterannounced that with the financial backing of the Perkins-Elmer Corporation, hewas founding Celera (from the Latin word for “speed”), a “private company tounravel the human genetic code.” Venter announced that he planned to completethe entire project in the unheard-of time of a mere three years!233[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos677321] It was a bold,perhaps even brazen announcement, for “nothing like the particular scheme he wasproposing had been attempted before. If it were broken down into its varioustechnical components, most of them had never even been attempted before,either.”234 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos677469] Inessence, if one wishes to compare the initial strategies of the public HumanGenome Project and Venter’s private Celera venture, the aim of the former wasquality, whereas Venter’s aim was speed. Thus, the Human Genome Project’s earlystrategy was to map each individual gene first, and then assemble the pieces —like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle — into their proper sequence later.235[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos677648] Venter’s goal wasmuch more ambitious, for not only did he wish to map every single humantrait,236 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos677797] but, byusing massive amounts of DNA-sequencing machines in a Manhattan Project-sizedassembly line that would blast the DNA into millions of tiny segments,reassemble and sequence the entire “book” of human DNA using supercomputers andvery complex computer algorithms to reassemble the pieces of the jigsaw in theirproper order. It was this “shotgun” approach of Venter that called forth roundsof denunciation from scientists within the public project,237[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos677947] and yet thatgalvanized its leader, Dr. Francis Collins, to recentralize what up until thenhad been a variety of public laboratories and university efforts into a morecoordinated effort,238[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos678106] and that also causedhim to re-evaluate the basic strategy the public project was pursuing. AfterVenter’s announcement, the public Human Genome Project adopted a mediatestrategy between its initial “qualitative” approach and Venter’s shotgunapproach, determining that it would go after a “rough draft” of the human genomesequence.239 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos678256]However, for the public project, there was a fly in the ointment, and that flywas the “Bermuda Accords,” to which all participants in the public project hadsubscribed. By mutual consent, all participants in the public Human GenomeProject had agreed that, once individual pieces of data — the bits of the“jigsaw map” — had been completed by the project, these data would be madepublicly accessible to everyone. This meant, of course, that Venter’s “Celeracould grab their data off the web like everyone else.” The faster the publicproject went, “the faster their enemy could go.”240[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos678406] This placed the HumanGenome Project in a Catch-22.241[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos678606]By adopting a kind of “Manhattan Project” approach using massive numbers of DNAsequencers and supercomputers with complex algorithms to assemble the pieces,Venter had in fact, reversed the initial roles that the public and privateprojects had assumed. After a few months into the race, Venter’s Celera was infact pursuing a detailed quality map of the entire genome, while the publicproject was aiming for a “rough draft.”242[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos679202]In the end, the race was so close that the Clinton Administration stepped in,and brokered what can only be described as a “truce” between Collins’ publicHuman Genome Project and Venter’s private Celera corporation in a declared“tie.”243 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos679363]"},{"pageContent":"B. TECHNOLOGIES AND LEGALITIES For our purposes, it is the technologies, techniques, and legal ramifications ofthe genome project and genetic engineering that must hold the center of ourattention, for these three things provide the interpretive key by which to pryloose possible hidden meanings in some very ancient texts. The task ofsequencing the enormous amount of information coiled up in the human doublehelix was the most daunting scientific problem mankind had ever faced, for evenif every gene was “decoded,” the problem of fitting a billion pieces of datainto a coherent map would require not only massive amounts of DNA sequencingmachines, but massive amounts of computer power, plus a computer program able toassemble the data spit out by the sequencers into a coherent picture. Thebenefits, however, were well worth the effort, for with the ability to sequencehuman DNA, any other organism was, by comparison, a comparative “snap.”Moreover, with such maps in hand, one might be able to derive genetically-baseddefinitions of life itself,244[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos679809] or even to figure outthe minimum amount of genes required in order for there to be life,245[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos679990] and finally, detailedgenetic knowledge of organisms would conceivably resolve one of the thornierproblems within biology itself: taxonomy, or how to classify various species oreven to determine if something was a distinct species.246[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos680140] Additionally, as weshall see, the techniques of genetic engineering required accurate maps of thegenome. Once that map was had, the implications — both good and ill — multiplylike rabbits. So, a closer look at the technologies, techniques, and legalimplications is in order."},{"pageContent":"1. THE TECHNOLOGY: SEQUENCERS To appreciate the revolution that Venter’s private Celera corporation brought tothe speed of unraveling the genome, one must understand the state of sequencingtechnology prior to it. The initial technique for reading a DNA sequence wasdeveloped by Fred Sanger of Cambridge University, and to appreciate itscomplexity and difficulty, it is best to cite Shreeve’s description of it atlength. It was an entirely manual technique, and therein lay the problem:> The difficulty of the problem was much greater than the metaphor of “reading> letters” suggests. Unlike letters, the four nucleotides of DNA cannot be> distinguished by their shape. Sanger’s method required a great deal of> ingenuity. He began by preparing a solution containing millions of copies of a> small DNA fragment, and divided the solution up into four equal parts. Then he> heated the four test tubes, which separated the double-stranded DNA into> single strands. To each tube, he added DNA polymerase, an enzyme that uses a> single strand of DNA as a template to re-create its missing partner, a> complementary string of base pairs. He also introduced a primer — a small> synthesized fragment of DNA of a given sequence of nucleotides. The primer> fragments would glom onto their complements on the template, which would tell> the enzyme where to start the copying process. He also supplied each tube with> plenty of free-floating nucleotides: the As, Ts, Gs, and Cs that the enzyme> would need as raw material to construct the complementary strings.> At this point in the experiment, the solution in each of the test tubes was> exactly the same. Next came the ingenious part. Sanger spiked each tube with a> smaller amount of a doctored form of one of the four nucleotides, which had> been tinkered with to stop the copying process in its tracks. In the first> tube, for instance, there might be a generous supply of ordinary Ts, As, Gs,> and Cs but a few of the doctored dead-end Ts as well. Whenever the enzyme> happened to grab one of these killjoys and attach it to the growing strand,> the reaction on that particular strand would cease. Thus, after reheating the> solution to separate the double-stranded DNA again, Sanger ended up with a> collection of single strands of differing sizes in that particular tube, each> one beginning at the start of the sequence, and each ending when a killer “T”> was attached. The same process was going on simultaneously in the other three> tubes with the three other DNA letters.> To read the sequence of the entire original DNA fragment, Sanger thus had only> to sort the fragments by their size, and read the last letter of each one.247> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos680281] But the method was obviously cumbersome, for with such a technique, mapping thehuman genome “would take 100,000 years, which alone might explain why a lot ofvery smart people initially thought the Human Genome Project a very stupididea.”248 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos680467] Clearlysome sort of engineering revolution was needed if the approach was to be lesscumbersome and capable of more rapid sequencing.Enter Tim Hunkapiller and his revolutionary idea.In the technique developed by Sanger, “the DNA letters were read by theresearcher’s eyeball, scanning both across and up the gel at the same time, aprocess that was both error-prone and squintingly slow.”249[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos680648] What was needed was aprocess that would mechanize the entire method.> Tim’s idea was to color-code the last letters in each fragment by chemically> attaching a different-colored dye to each of the four doctored, killjoy> nucleotides: blue for C, yellow for G, red for T, and green for A. As each> fragment in turn arrived at the bottom of the gel, the color of its last> letter could be read by a detector, which would feed this information to a> computer.

While the major revolution had indeed been achieved, something else wasstill needed if Venter’s goal of mapping the entire genome within three yearswas to be feasible. The problem with preparing such slab gels was simply thatone always ran the chance of one bleeding into another, thus ruining the wholeexperiment.> An alternative to slab gels had been in the air for years. Instead of running> dozens of samples down a common gel, each sample might be enclosed in a thin,> gel-filled capillary tube, where it couldn’t possibly wander into its> neighbor’s lane.

THE TECHNOLOGY: SUPER-COMPUTERS Sequencing the entire human genome into an accurate map required not only thecomputing power of a supercomputer, but a whole new type of computerarchitecture.> A typical supercomputer — say, a Cray — built its muscle by stringing together> enormous numbers of processors. But the all-at-once assembly of the human> genome could not be solved by lots of little processors; it required gross> amounts of active memory that could handle a single process, very fast.> Virtually all computers on the market at the time employed a 32-bit> architecture, which was limited by physics to 4 gigabytes of active memory.> The assembly algorithms alone were estimated to need 20 gigabytes of RAM, at> the same time that the computer would be servicing all the rest of (Celera’s)> needs.

THE TECHNIQUE: COMPUTER ALGORITHMS In addition to the massive computational power required for the accurate mappingof the genome, there was also a massive software problem as well. The sheer sizeof the computer program itself required to do so would be immense, not tomention the several discrete tasks that it would have to perform, and to performflawlessly, for the fact was that “a computing problem the size of the entirehuman genome had never been attempted before.”254[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos681455] Indeed, it couldhonestly be said that the problem of accurately sequencing the entire humangenome was as much a triumph of computer programming as it was of biology orrevolutions in sequencing technology.The initial programming difficulty lay in these two precise things: (1) thesheer size of the genome itself and the amount of data that needed to beprocessed and assembled, and (2) the discrete tasks that such a complex programwould have to perform. It could not, therefore, be reduced to a single principleor mathematical formula.255[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos681605]> The sequenced fragments of DNA coming out of the machines are the puzzle> pieces, and the genome is the image they form when all the pieces are locked> into place.

Ways of checking> and refining each component would be incorporated into the program. But> whether it worked or not would be revealed only in the last step, when the> time came to upend the can and see what tumbled out.259> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos682241] In addition to all this, there was also the problem of “statistical noise,”i.e., the accuracy of the data coming from the biologists’ sequencing machines.Thus, the program also had to be designed in such a fashion that it could workwith realistic data coming from the sequencers.260[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos682382]Yet another problem facing Celera’s programmers was the problem of contiguousDNA fragments and the whole phenomenon of having to fit the “DNA islands”together by looking at overlapping base pairs. The “Overlapper” component of thecomputer program, however, faced a fundamental difficulty, and that was that> ...both the (fruit fly) and human genomes were riddled with identical> repeating sections. As a consequence, all too often a fragment of DNA would> overlap with two, three, or even a dozen other pieces, because the overlapping> sequence was represented in more than one place in the genome. At all costs,> the assembly program had to avoid making false connections, which could> mislead researchers for decades to come. For the next step of the assembler,> then (Celera’s programmer) Myers had written a program that essentially broke> apart most of what the Overlapper had put together, keeping only those joins> where a piece went together with only one other piece. Myers called the result> of these uniquely joined pieces a “unitig.” In effect, rather than attacking> the problem of a complex genome’s thousands of repeats, the Unitigger stage> dodged the issue for the moment, telling the computer, “Let’s just assemble> the pieces we know go together correctly and throw the rest into a bin to deal> with later.” The Unitigger was an act of genius, in one stroke reducing the> complexity of the puzzle by a factor of 100.261> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos682563] In short, the “Celera Assembler,” which is what the program was eventuallycalled, was confronted, via the overlaps, with “an infinite chain of forks in apath, and the program had to be able to choose the right turn every time and notoverlap one piece of code with an extremely similar one that might actually bemiles away in the genome.”262[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos682744] After testing theprogram against several already known or well-mapped genomes, Celera’s programwas finally successful, and its lawyers moved immediately to patent theprogram.263 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos682925]"},{"pageContent":"4. THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS The patenting of Celera’s Assembler is the gateway into the larger issue ofpatenting specific genes and engineered life forms. In a way, the rush to patentvarious genes or genetically engineered life forms might be considered a kind ofgenetic or “molecular land grab.”264[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos683075] Early on, in fact, anisolated human gene was ruled by the U.S. Patent and Trademark office that itcould be considered “valid intellectual property, if it fulfilled therequirements that any other invention had to meet in order to get a patent.”265[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos683224] It is important tonote what is being said here. The entire genome of an organism, since it alreadyexists in nature and cannot be invented, cannot be patented. It would be liketrying to patent an eagle or an oak tree or, for that matter, a mountain range.But one could patent certain individual genes or sections of the genome if theywere separated for some function “by the hand of man.”266[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos683389]Under this understanding then, there are four requirements in U.S. patent lawthat an invention must meet to be patentable intellectual property:> The invention must first be original. It cannot have been published before, or> be too much like some previous invention. Second, it must be “nonobvious.” You> cannot get a patent by wrapping a rock in cloth and calling it a no-scuff> doorstop. Third, the invention must have a demonstrable function. If you mix> silicone with boric oxide and come up with an exceptionally bouncy rubber, you> won’t necessarily get a patent. Demonstrate its value as a toy, however, and> you can call it Silly Putty and make a fortune. The final guideline requires> “enablement”: The invention must be described clearly enough in writing so> that any skilled practitioner in the same trade can read it and fashion the> invention himself. A patent does not confer ownership. It is simply a contract> between the inventor and the government, whereby the former agrees to make> public his invention in exchange for legal protection against others making or> using it for commercial purposes for the next twenty years....> ....Under the first guideline, an organism or any part of one in its natural> living state is clearly unpatentable, since it does not originate with the> inventor. But in 1972, Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen won a patent on the> process they had invented to manufacture human insulin by cloning its gene.> That same year, microbiologist Ananda Chakrabarry applied for a patent on a> microbe he had constructed that could degrade crude oil.

But the patent examiner disallowed the application,> arguing that microorganisms are products of nature and therefore not original.> Chakrabarry appealed the decision, and by 1980 the case had found its way to> the U.S. Supreme Court.

THE POTENTIALITIES OF GENETIC ENGINEERING Chakrabarry’s genetically engineered microorganism reveals the full potentiality— both for good and ill — of genetic engineering and, moreover, the private“ownership” or use of such engineered creations.

THE “MESOPOTAMIAN” GENOME WAR: THE O’BRIENS AGAIN The Babylonian “creation epic” Enuma Elish — which I have elsewhere interpretedas a “war epic” and not a creation epic at all270[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos684081] — contains theslightest hint of the possibility of genetic engineering of chimerical beings inancient times, referring to “scorpion men” and “fish men.”271[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos684379] Of course, theseambiguous references could mean almost anything, from metaphorical expressionsto fully-fledged expressions of the role of a genetic technology in that war.But the Enuma Elish is hardly the only ancient Mesopotamian text containingstatements suggestive of an active technology of genetic engineering in play inpaleoancient272 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos684529]times. Indeed, in the Atra-Hasis epic, the creation of mankind himself isdescribed both in grisly terms and in terms that strongly suggest that mankindis himself one such chimerical creature, a genetic mixture of “the gods” and ofsome pre-existing terrestrial hominid. Here is how the academic translation ofSumerologist Stephanie Dalley recounts the story:> When the gods instead of man> Did the work, bore the loads,> The gods’ load was too great,> The work too hard, the trouble too much.> The great Anunnaki made the Igigi273> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos684867]> Carry the workload sevenfold.> Anu their father was king,> Their counselor warrior Ellil,> Their chamberlain was Ninurta,> Their canal-controller Ennugi,> They took the box [of lots]....,> Cast the lots; the gods made the division.> Anu went up to the sky, [And Ellil(?)] took the earth for his people (?)...274[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos685022]> They were counting the years of loads.> For 3,600 years they bore the excess,> Hard work night and day.> They groaned and blamed each other,> Grumbled over the masses of excavated soil;> “Let us confront our [ ] the chamberlain,> And get him to relieve us of our hard work!> Come, let us carry [the Lord(?)].> The counselor of gods, the warrior, from his dwelling...”275> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos685212] As I observed in my book The Cosmic War, these passages make it clear that the“gods” were very near “open revolt due to the exorbitant workload laid on them,and they demand to see the ‘chamberlain.’”276[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos685393]A little later in the epic, the “strike” threatens to become an open revolt orcivil war:> “Every single one of us gods declared war!> We have put [a stop] to the digging.> The load is excessive, it is killing us!> Our work is too hard, the trouble too much!> So every single one of us gods> Has agreed to complain to Ellil.”277> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos685568] Seeking some way to ease their burden, the “gods” decide to create anintelligent worker for the precise purpose of being a worker, a serf, a slave, afunction that we shall say more about toward the end of this chapter:> Ea278 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos685813] made his> voice heard> And spoke to the gods his brothers...> ...> “There is [ ]> Belet-ili the womb goddess is present —> Let her create primeval man> So that he may bear the yoke [( )],> So that he may bear the yoke, [the work of Ellil],> Let man bear the load of the gods!”279> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos685996] Then, further on in the text, the rather grisly methods of the creation ofmankind are described in detail:> Enki made his voice heard,> And spoke to the great gods,> “On the first, seventh, and fifteenth of the month> I shall make a purification by washing.> Then one god should be slaughtered.> And the gods can be purified by immersion.> Nintu shall mix clay> With his flesh and blood.> Then a god and a man> Will be mixed together in clay.> Let us hear the drumbeat forever after,> Let a ghost come into existence from the god’s flesh,> Let her proclaim it as his living sign,> And let the ghost exist so as not to forget (the slain god).”> They answered “yes!” in the assembly,> The great Anunnaki who assign the fates.280> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos686177] After taking the decision to create mankind, a serf-worker, the Anunnaki “gods”“then proceed to the task of slaughtering one of their own and creating‘primeval man.’”281 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos686358]> In the first, seventh, and fifteenth of the month> He made a purification by washing.> Ilawela who had intelligence,> They slaughtered in their assembly.> Nintu mixed clay> With his flesh and blood.> They heard the drumbeat forever after.282> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos686533] As I observed in The Cosmic War, this account — amore or less standard type ofacademic translation of the text — gives a “crucial insight into the ‘morality’of the Anunnaki, who are clearly not above murdering one of their own to lightenthe workload of the rest” in order to create their worker-serf, man.283[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos686714]Enter Christian and Barbara Joy O’Brien and their landmark book The Genius ofthe Few once again, for they maintain that such standard exercises of academictranslation may be missing some significant clues. But in order to appreciatethe case that they argue, it is necessary to understand it in the light of theirwider methodological assumptions, for these in turn raise, once again, issuesfor religious apologetics.The O’Briens state the theme and sources consulted in their book in thefollowing fashion:> The Genius of the Few is an account of the activities of a group of culturally> and technically advanced people who settled in a mountain valley in the Near> East around 8200 B.C. and, as their primary concern, established an> agricultural centre for the teaching and training of local tribesmen. Their> secondary activities were even more dramatic if the accounts which we have> from Akkadian sources, and our interpretations of them, are to be accepted.> The records of these Shining Ones, as we prefer to call them, are taken from> three principal sources: (a) Sumerian tablets from the Library of Nippur on> which they are referrred to as the (Anunnaki); (b) ancient documents from the> Hebraic Books of Enoch where they are described as Angels; and (c) a critical> interpretation of the biblical Book of Genesis which uses the Hebrew words ha> elohim. 284 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos686889] It is with the first of their sources — the Akkadian tablets from the Library ofNippur — and with their interpretation of them that we will be chiefly concernedhere.Additionally, the O’Briens believe that archaeology and, by implication,paleography itself, are in part to blame for what they believe is a massivemisinterpretation — and, by implication, mistranslation — of these ancientstories:> In this sphere, one small, undetected error in comparison can become> self-perpetuating and mar the whole fabric of the interpretation. And even> worse, one small, but attractive, error in interpretation can set up a chain> reaction that can lead to whole histories being wrongly conceived.285> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos687122] For the O’Briens, this background forms the basis for three significantmethodological assumptions that they make, which informs the whole of theirbook. Christian O’Brien states these three assumptions with astonishing clarity:> ...(Archaeologists) certainly did not have the answer to the development of> the Middle East — because behind each successive magnificent advance there had> lain, undetected, the arcane stimulus of the genius of the few. Or had it been> detected, and not recognized? I found that I needed fresh skills in the study> of this arcane influence. I turned to languages — Sumerian, Hebrew, Greek, and> even Gaelic where it was required; I translated tablets from Nippur that had> not been touched in almost a hundred years, and unearthed Hebrew books that,> until a few years ago, had not been available for study for more than fifteen> centuries. Gradually, the doubts crystallized — I was not sure that we were> right — but I was certain as I was of my own existence that scholars, over> five millenia [sic], had gone very wrong.> And, in taking the path that they had, they had established concepts that> never should have been in the receptive minds of men. Fundamentally, early> scholars had given too little weight to those deification processes to which> the later Sumerians, and the Babylonians, were fanatically prone... making> gods where none had existed... and hiding glories of erudition and altruistic> activity behind the mask of the shrine. Moreover, later archaeologists, and> anthropologists, too, followed in that same path which tends to confuse the> secular with the religious; which turns palaces into temples, houses into> shrines, customs into rites; and makes every buried statuette a religious> relic.> Out of the earliest of these unfortunate mistakes, there grew a strange> religious tradition that fed, avidly, upon itself, and grew stronger with> every act of worship and ritual repetition. Shiningcountenanced Lords of> Cultivation, as they were described in ancient writings, became blurred and> distant memories... and were elevated to gods. And the leaders of those same> Lords became Gods; and the supreme commander of them all — Great Anu to the> Sumerians, and the Most High to the Hebrew — vicariously became GOD.> And all that time, the true God, the Spirit who is the ultimate arbiter of all> Mankind, remained unknown to all but the mystics... as far above those> resplendent creatures as we are about the worms in the field.286> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos687329] Note carefully what the implications of Christian O’Brien’s statements reallyare for the methodology by which he proposes to interpret the texts hetranslates and examines:> 1) He presupposes the existence of a hidden elite that is not of the species> Homo sapiens sapiens quietly guiding human civilization;> 2) He presupposes that the fundamental error of academic examination of the> artifacts and texts of the earliest period from this region is to interpret> everything as being an example of the deification processes of the Sumerians> and Akkadians themselves, whereas, he maintains, if examined from a wholly> secular point of view, a radically different picture emerges of what those> texts might actually be saying; But what of the third methodological assumption? O’Brien notes that one primaryfeature of these ancient languages is paronomasia:> Another source of ambiguity lies in the fact that early Middle Eastern> languages leant heavily on paronomasia to give variety to simple phrases — a> form of punning which allowed several different meanings to be given to a> single set of symbols.287> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos687640] Thus we have the third component:> 3) The paronomastic nature of ancient languages of the region permits one to> translate such texts by a wholly different paradigm — the radically secular> one — by noting the plain literal meaning of words, and allowing for the> possibility that a primitive language is describing advanced technology in> use. The error of academic translations is not, therefore, in mistranslation> of individual words or phrases, for given the paranomastic nature of those> languages, such interpretations are plausible. But, says O’Brien, they are not> the only possible ones, and the implication of his remarks is that if there is> an error in those translations, it is a paradigm error and not a philological> one. Or, if one wishes to speculate a bit more, the paranomastic nature of> these languages permits the true nature of the history being recounted to be> hidden behind a religious patina, a “psychological operation” called religion,> which only served to empower the same hidden elite. This, fundamentally, is> the general methodological principle of the O’Briens, as is evident from their> remarks cited above.288> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos688033] This brings us to the central text in their “paradigm reinterpretation,” theso-called Kharsag Epic, or Kharsag Tablets, a set of tablets first published andtranslated by George Aaron Barton in 1918.289[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos688396] While standardscholarship tends to view these tablets as more or less disjunct from eachother, the O’Briens believe they form a more or less contiguous narrative.290[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos688673]"},{"pageContent":"1. THE ANUNNAKI AND THE ENGINEERING OF MAN What, then, emerges from these texts concerning the creation of mankind, if oneadopts their “secular paradigm” of interpretation, and their assumption of theexistence of a hidden elite? Here the crucial tablet is the 8th tablet. TheO’Briens begin by noting that even in the book of Genesis there is a residue ofthe Sumerian idea that mankind was created to be a worker-serf for the gods, forhe was created and placed in the Garden of Eden for the purpose of tilling andkeeping it.291 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos688884] Thisis an important point, for it implies that the account in Genesis chapter two isa heavily edited text, since it omits crucial details of the earlier cuneiformversion, if indeed the cuneiform formed any sort of basis for the Genesisaccount.The O’Briens then cite the relevant portion from the Kharsag tablets detailingthe creation of mankind (and note the differences in translational style betweenthem and Stephanie Dalley); Enki has the floor, and is addressing the other“gods”:> “What are we accusing them of? Their work was very heavy, and caused them much> distress [... ... ...] while Belet-ili, the creator of life, is present. Let> her create a ‘lullu’ — a man, and let the man do the work, and carry the> burden of the toil of the lordlings...> “While Belet-ili,292> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos689034] the creator of> life, is here, let her create offspring, and when they become men, let them> bear the toil of their lordlings.”> They sent for Ma-mi, the creator of life, and told her: “You are the> biological expert,293> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos689281] the creatress of> Mankind, we want you now to create a lullu so that he may undertake the tasks> assigned by Enlil, and so relieve the toil of the lordlings.”> In reply, the Lady of Creation said to the (Anunnaki), “It is not possible,> for me to make these things on my own; Enki has the skills I need. As he can> purify everything [or everybody], let him prepare the material that I need.”> > > > > > We now reach difficulties in the interpretation. The text continues by Enki> proposing to make a purifying bath on three separate days, roughly a week> apart in which he wishes all the lordlings to be dipped for cleansing. Then he> requires that one lordling be slaughtered, and that Nintu should mix “clay”> from his flesh and blood. The verbatim text is as follows.> > Enki opened his mouth> > And addressed the great gods> > “On the first, seventh, and fifteenth day of the month> > I will make a purifying bath.> > Let one god be slaughtered> > So that all the gods may be cleansed in a dipping.> > From his flesh and blood> > Let Nintu mix clay,> > That god and man> > May be thoroughly mixed in the clay> > [... ... ... ...].294> > [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos689617]> > Thus, even on a standard sort of “academic translation,” mankind emerges as twothings:> 1. a creature deliberately created or invented for the specific function of> being a laborer, a serf, for the “gods”; and,> 2. a creature that is a chimera, a hybrid of two different creatures: (a) the> gods, and (b) some presumably pre-existing terrestrial hominid.But it is precisely here, in this passage, that the O’Briens assert that thetranslational “paradigm error” occurs to obscure what is really taking place:> As with the translations of the early chapters of Genesis, something has gone> wildly wrong! From what has preceded, the reader will appreciate that the> great (Anunnaki) were not such ninnies, or such scoundrels, as to murder one> of their own people and then require Ninlil to mix “clay” from his flesh and> blood.

In any case, how does man take part in the> hybridization?> We are satisfied that the authors of Atra-Hasis have produced the best> translation possible from the Akkadian text.

Now, the question is —> can we, with the material supplied, provide a more realistic account?295> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos689878] The fault in this one instance, in other words, was not in the modern scholarlytranslations, but rather in a mistranslation original to the Akkadian, or, asone scholar of Sumerian grammar aptly quipped, “One may say that we see Sumerianthrough an Akkadian glass darkly.”296[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos690033]So how do the O’Briens apply their more secular approach to uncover what theybelieve to have been an original scribal mistranslation?> In the first place, the translation of the term ri-im-ka is suspect. The root> word rimku does, indeed, mean “washing,” but need not imply a bath. The word> can also mean “pouring out,” and in that context could be translated as> “draught”; and it is more likely that all the lordlings would be given (blood)> purifying draughts on the first, seventh, and fifteenth days of the month> before one was chosen for the experiment, than that they would be given weekly> baths.> In the second place, it is not necessary to slaughter someone in order to> obtain their purified blood.

THE O’BRIENS ON THE TECHNOLOGICAL INDICATIONS What then of the “clay” or “culture”? Could a similar case be made for acorrupted Sumerian origin for the term?> The Akkadian word for this “clay” was tittu; written as ti-it-tu. In the> context of the hybridization story, the Akkadian word is meaningless to us —> and we believe that it was the same to the Akkadian scribes.

Consequently, we must ask ourselves what ti-it-tu> could have meant to the Sumerians.> The syllables had the following archaic signs and meanings: At this juncture, the O’Briens reproduce the following table: ti033 [images/00033.jpg]‘to live’, live‘, or living’.or ti(n)034[images/00034.jpg]‘life’ — probably an early variant of the above.it orid‘with’.tu 035 [images/00035.jpg]‘bear’, ‘beget’, enter‘.or tu(n) 036[images/00036.jpg]’Portion‘, ’piece‘, or ’increase‘. They then comment as follows:> All these meanings appear to be apposite to the subject matter so,> consequently, it is possible to consider that the “clay” which Nintu was to> mix with lordling sperm (spittle) was a “piece of life” or “material of life.”> The jump that must be taken, here, is to conclude that this “piece of life”> was a “female ovum.” And this jump is justified by the closing stages of the> narrative where fourteen “mothers” are brought into the story to carry the> resulting embryos.300> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos690863] With this secular, “technological” paradigm of interpretation in hand, they notethat “it should be possible to continue the narrative with some degree ofcredibility.”301 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos691076] Thetranslation resulting from this paradigm shift is rather intriguing for itsimplications:> Enki said: “On the first, seventh, and fifteenth day of the month, I will> prepare purifying draughts; let all the lordlings be purified, and then choose> one from whom to take a blood sample. From his flesh and blood we will take> what is required for the Lady of Creation to mix the life cultures, so that> the lordling and man may be thoroughly hybridized in the culture. Let the> hybrid receive “spirit” from the lordling’s flesh, and then, let us not forget> that living man will have a “spirit.”> In the Assembly, the Great (Anunnaki), who administer the affairs of Earth,> agreed. On the first, seventh, and fifteenth day of the month, Enki made the> purifying draughts. We-ila, who had the right characteristics, was chosen by> the Assembly to give blood.

[... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...]> After she had mixed the cultures, she summoned the (Anunnaki), the great> lords.> The lordlings [the great lords] gave their sperm for the life cultures.302> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos691284] Thus, on any reading, if the text is to be credited with any veracity —a“standard academic” translation such as Dalley’s, or in a more secularizedtranslation such as the O’Briens’ — mankind is an engineered hybridizedcreature, part “lordling” and part “human.” In the O’Briens’ view, the spermdonor came from a “lordling,” or one of the Anunnaki, and the egg donors werehuman.303 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos691442]But what of the assertion that one of the “gods” had to be slaughtered in orderto bring this to pass? Again, the paradigm shift and methodological assumptionslead the O’Briens to a very different translational conclusion:> ...(It) is far more probable that the (Anunnaki) wished, not to kill, but to> “shed blood” for the purpose of obtaining blood samples from which they could> select the most suitable of the lordlings.> The importance of the blood sample in determining histocompatibility is well> known in modern medicine, because foetal wastage due to blood-group> incompatibility forms a serious proportion of stillbirths. It is known, for> example, that O-group mothers will more often carry incompatible foetuses than> mothers of other blood-groups; in fact, where B- and AB-group males marry> O-group females, such matings are termed ABO-incompatible. If this occurs so> frequently among modern, polymorphous, but related populations, it may have> been far more serious a problem when attempting a conjugation of (Anunnaki)> and Hominid, and may have required a very careful selection of blood type.> Even among apparently compatible types, it may have been necessary to make a> detailed study of the effect of important antigens on suitable cells and> tissues, notably on both blood cells and skin cells, to determine their effect> on histocompatibility. This may well be the explanation for the use of both> blood and “flesh” in the experiments carried out by Enki and Ma-mi. In fact,> the purification process mentioned may have referred to the process of> neutralizing incompatible antigens in the male donor.> The Lady of Creation so manipulated the cultures that lordling and man were> “thoroughly mixed.” In genetic terms, this mixture was to be half Lordling and> half Human; and since the former are stated to have provided the male> elements, the female elements must have been taken from human women; and these> women could only have come from the Cro-Magnon tribes in the vicinity. Earlier> in the epic, Enki is quoted as saying: “You are the biological expert, the> creatress of Mankind, we want you now to create a lullu...” From this we might> infer that, in her role of biologist to the (Anunnaki), Ninlil had previously> been active in creating Mankind, and this lullu was to be an ad hoc operation,> possibly resulting in a specialized hybrid, bred for heavy labour.> Such an inference would raise problems. Mankind, at that time, was the> Cro-Magnon race and admittedly, it had appeared very suddenly, and markedly> superior to its contemporaries — the Neanderthalers. But that event was thirty> thousand years earlier; and it would have had to have been another biological> expert from another (Anunnaki) group. Could the (Anunnaki) have descended> twice onto the Near East? And could they have carried out an earlier> hybridization between themselves and the Neanderthalers — to produce the> remarkable advance from Neanderthal to Cro-Magnon?> In answer to these two imponderable questions, we can only state that there is> no evidence that they did so; but absence of evidence cannot be taken as> evidence of absence. They might have!304> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos691592] Their technological “translation” of texts, however, reaches its true zenithwhen they turn to other considerations in the text.> The implementation of the hybridization project took place in the Bit Shimti.> Bit was the Akkadian for “house” but Shimti, or si-im-ti, is a word that might> have the seed of surprise within it. The archaic pictograms of the Sumerian> syllables may be analyzed as follows... They then reproduce the following insert:(i)037 [images/00037.jpg]O’Briens’ Sumerian Insert305[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos691800] The O’Briens then suggest that the meaning is simply what is literallysuggested: a “bright eye for seeing.”306[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos691950]Then they follow this up with another insert of the Sumerian cuneiograms of thephonetic syllables:(ii)038 [images/00038.jpg](iii)039 [images/00039.jpg]O’Briens’ Sumerian Cuneiogram Insert307[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos692091] It is best to cite the O’Briens directly on what they believe is the technologysignified by this odd assortment of word roots: “The best combination of thesemeanings is ‘bright eye for examining the life culture.’ The Bit Shimti may wellhave been the building which housed this piece of apparatus which appears toindicate an illuminated miscroscope.”308[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos692299] That is possible, butgiven all the preceding discussion of the modern genome project, and the vastarray of equipment needed to sequence the genome much less splice the genes ofone organism to another, the meaning might equally be taken to indicate thesequencers and color-coded light-readers themselves. In short, to make such areading as the O’Briens’ work, much more technological resources would be neededthan mere microscopes. This indeed might point to a fundamental difficulty withtheir “paradigm shift in translation,” for the sheer size of a project to dowhat they are suggesting is implied by the scope of the task itself, and yet thetexts that they cite do not seem to hint of a project of such scale. Moreover,as we have seen in the first parts of this chapter, such a project would requiremassive computational power, and again, there are no hints of this in the textsthey cite. Regrettably, the O’Briens do not make a complete translation of allthe Kharsag tablets in their book, which might yield such information.309[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos692440]What does all this add up to in the O’Briens’ opinion? There are, they maintain,but two possibilities for the genetic constitution of mankind, if one takesthese ancient tablets — and their own interpretation of them — seriously:> 1. If Cro-Magnon Man were a hybrid of Neanderthal Man and (Anunnaki), and the> Patriarchal tribes were hybrids of Cro-Magnon Man and the (Anunnaki), then the> Patriarchal tribespeople — who were the progenitors of the Jewish race — were> three parts (Anunnaki) and only one part Neanderthal.310> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos692660]> 2. Alternatively, if Cro-Magnon were not a hybrid, but an evolutionary> mutation of Early Man, then the Patriarchal tribes were half (Anunnaki) and> half Early Man.> In either case, it has to be stated that the Jewish race, through their> Patriarchal progenitors, carry more of the “divine” (Anunnaki) strain within> their cells than us Gentiles. The percentages would be roughly as follows: Patriarchal TribesGentilesCase 1:75% (Anunnaki)/25% Hominid50% (Anunnaki)/50%HominidCase 2:50% (Anunnaki)/50% HominidNil (Anunnaki)/100% Hominid It is worth citing how the O’Briens continue to explore this question.> Which case is correct? There are only four clues — the first lies with the> infant Noah who was so startlingly like the Shining Ones, and so startlingly> unlike his own family, that his father was constrained to beg Methuselah to> make the forbidden journey to Eden to obtain reassurance from Enoch.311> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos692991] They then cite the Book of Enoch, 106: 1–8:> After some time, my son Methuselah took a wife for his son, Lamech, and she> became pregnant by him and gave birth to a son. The child’s body was as white> as snow and as red as the rose, and the hair of his head was in long locks> which were as white as wool: and his eyes were beautiful.

Of course, this would have been more likely to happen> under Case 1, but could still have happened under Case 2.313> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos693563] Or to put it in rather more stark terms — ones that reveal the completeimplications — Noah was himself a product of the b’nai elohim or “sons of God”(or “sons of the gods”) of Genesis 6, and of the daughters of men: Noah himselfwas a hybrid, and suggestively, the implication is that he might not really havebeen the biological son of Lamech at all.For the O’Briens, then, there is a hidden reason why Noah and his family were“saved” from the flood, for he clearly bore a “divine” bloodline that “thepowers that be” or rather “the powers that were” wished to preserve.314[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos693704]But it is the “fourth clue” in which the O’Briens find the “definitive key” tounraveling the mystery, for some of the Anunnaki, the fallen ones designated“Watchers” in the Book of Enoch,> ...were able to procreate with the daughters of the Patriarchs.

In chapters seven and eight, weshall see just how closely this harmonizes not only with other ancient texts andlegends, but with aspects of the standard model of human origins within scienceas well.A hint of it is given in the Mayan creation epic, the Popul Vuh, an ocean awayin Meso-America:> The Popul Vuh states that mankind had been created to be a servant of the> “gods.” The “gods” are quoted:> > > > > > “Let us make him who shall nourish and sustain us!

The> “figures of wood” did not have souls, relates the Popul Vuh, and so they> walked on all fours “aimlessly.” In other words, without souls (spiritual> beings) to animate the bodies, the “gods” found that they had created living> creatures which could biologically reproduce, but which lacked the> intelligence to have goals or direction.> ...> Creating Homo sapiens did not end Custodial headaches, however.

Note also that the reasonsgiven for mankind’s creation in the Popul Vuh are identical to the reasons givenin texts from the Middle East, both Mesopotamian and biblical: the “gods” neededslaves to do their work for them and to worship them."},{"pageContent":"3. VERIFICATION: GENETICS, SPACE, AND SKELETONS But if all this is true, how might one go about verifying it? There are someclues from various texts that afford a speculative basis by which the O’Briens’interpretations of ancient texts and arguments might be verified. The Book ofGenesis and other books of the Bible, for example, record the offspring of suchunions as being of gigantic or larger than normal stature. Indeed, the wordlugal itself, often translated as “king” in academic translations, simply means“big man,” and this fact, coupled with the large stature of ancient kingsdepicted in Mesopotamian cylinder seals might indicate not a metaphorical andartistic device, but an actual truth.But something more is required for verification than this.It is here that one must connect the dots in an unusual fashion. Space anomaliesresearcher Richard C. Hoagland has demonstrated, in a series of remarkablepapers on his website, that the Saturnian moon Iapetus and the Martian moonPhobos show distinctive and persuasive signs of being great artificialbodies.317 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos694285] Theselarge bodies, if artificial — and this author believes that Hoagland’s case isvery strong — would possibly be the natural products of intelligent human-likecreatures of large stature. It is thus possible that in addition to the recoveryof ancient technology — should humanity ever journey to and explore those“moons” — we might also discover that bodies that could, upon geneticexamination, indicate a genetic relationship to humanity.Additionally, the statements of ancient texts mentioned previously would alsoseem to imply, here on earth, the existence somewhere of the remains of suchcreatures. Of course, the Internet is rife with “photographs” of such allegedgiant remains, and in all cases known to this author, these are elaboratehoaxes. Nonetheless, as we shall discover in the next chapter, there areindications that these remains have been discovered... and quietly spiritedaway."},{"pageContent":"4. WHOSE AGENDA, PUBLIC, OR PRIVATE? As was seen previously, the modern genome race raised profound questions andimplications for ethics and jurisprudence: were specific genes, or the processesused to map them, patentable? More importantly, were chimerical, or hybrid lifeforms, patentable? The last question assumes even more importance if theforegoing Sumerian accounts of the origins of mankind are true, for by anytranslation — whether those of the O’Briens or more standard academictranslations — mankind is a chimerical, engineered creature.As such, it is worth recounting what the four requirements for the grant of apatent are under modern American law. To be patentable, an invention or processmust:> 1. be original;> 2. be non-obvious;> 3. have a demonstrable function; and,> 4. be enabling, i.e., any inventor or engineer should be able to read the> patent and be able to reproduce the invention or process it describes.318> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos694613]It is worth recalling that the landmark 1980 Supreme Court decision grantedAnanda Chakrabarry a patent on an engineered microbe on the basis that “MotherNature may have supplied the ingredients, but Chakrabarry baked the cake.”319[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos694794] So long as “the handof man” was involved in the engineering, the process — and even the organismitself, if it was not naturally occurring — was patentable.This places the story of the creation of man as told in the ancient cuneiformtablets into an interesting light, for if true, then under the standards ofAmerican patent law, the human being as a hybrid creature would apparentlyfulfill all four requirements for a patent. As such, human beings, as chimericalhybrids of two other species, are (1) original; (2) non-obvious, for they arenot the products of nature, but of “the hand of ‘man’,” (3) were created for ademonstrable function, i.e., were created to be slaves and serfs of the “gods,”and (4) they were the result of a process of genetic engineering that wasreproducible “by the hand of man,” and therefore, the process was “enabling,”allowing any competent genetic engineer to reduplicate the process.These implications compel some speculative questions, for if mankind ascurrently constituted is a chimerical creature, a genetically engineeredcreature, and moreover, was created for the express purpose of being a slave tothe “gods,” then who owns him? Let us speculate: if mankind’s originalowner-creators were suddenly to return — right now — to planet Earth, would theyhave a legal claim? And would, moreover, they be able to prove it? Would theyattempt to re-assert their old hegemony? And what court would have legaljurisdiction to hear such a case? Additionally, one would be faced with twolegal claims: (1) that of the returning “owner-creators,” and (2) that of thecourse of performance of humanity since their “departure,” which would legallydemonstrate humanity’s independence and self-governance since their departure.Humanity would, so to speak, be abandoned property and under new ownership,namely, itself. Would these owner-creators attempt to reassert their ownershipby demonstrations of force and superior technology, only to discover thathumanity can now “shoot back”?Disturbing questions all, but there is yet another question that looms over themall, and that is, in the cuneiform accounts of the creation of man, is hiscreation that of a private or “corporate” entity, or a public one? Is thequestion of “ownership” even relevant? Given all the argumentation of thepreceding pages, our inclination is to conclude that mankind was created by aprivate, corporate entity, and for the service of specific “gods” within thepantheon, for as has been seen, the establishment of a reliably accurate,reproducible standard of weights and measures based on astronomical and geodeticprinciples, was the work largely of a private elite, and done for the purposesof the ultimate establishment of trade. We must conclude, too, that the statusof slavery in early ancient legal codes may be a residue of the creation ofmankind himself.320 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos694944]All these points argue for a corporate rather than a state or governmental elitehaving been involved in mankind’s creation.Whatever else one may make of the reading of the Kharsag tablets by the O’Briensand others, one thing stands out as an inevitable consequence of suchinterpretations, and that is, that in order for such a genetic engineeringproject to have succeeded, the whole modern panoply of scientific discoveriesand technologies associated with the modern genome project had to have existedin “paleoancient” times as well: sequencers, microscopes, organic chemistry, theknowledge of the double helix itself, the techniques of splicing, and, ofcourse, a complete “genetic map” of the species involved in the hybridization ofman. In short, if the cuneiform tablets are to be believed, then at least asimilar pitch of genetic science had to exist — if not much greater — inprehistoric times than exists now.How, then, would one go about establishing the truth, or lack thereof, of theastonishing claims of those tablets? One cannot settle here simply forreinterpretations of those tablets along the lines of the O’Briens, for in thatcase one is assuming what one is proving. One must have external corroboration.And that corroboration, by the nature of the case, can only come from within themodern human genome itself. Is there a “code” within the genetic code that mightsuggest that we are indeed the creatures of such a project begun and executedlong ago? Is there a hint of the “artificiality” of modern man? And if so, whois searching for it, and why? Are there indeed remains of giants that have beenquietly spirited away?

THE CODES WITHIN THE CODE It was after the discovery of the double helix and the basic structure of thehuman genome that some biologists and geneticists noticed a peculiar thing,indeed, a thing so peculiar that it defied all the laws of coincidence andchance: the strong resemblance of the structure of DNA to the structure of theancient Chinese system of divination, the I Ching.322[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos696309] DNA I Ching 1.Discovered ten years ago, has existed since life began. All thevital processes of all liv ing creatures whose structure, form and heredity areprogrammed in precise detail universal claim. 1.All processes of livingdevelopment throughout nature are subject to one strictly detailed program(universal physi cal, metaphysical, psychological, moral claim)2.The basis isthe plus and minus double helix of DNA.2.The basis is the manifestation of theworld principle in the primal poles yang (__) and yin (_ _)3.Four letters areavailable for labeling this double helix: A-T, C-G (adenine, thymine, cytosine,guanine), which are joined in pairs.3.Four letters suffice for life in all itsfull ness.7= resting yang --9= moving yang --8= resting yin -6 = moving yin®¬4.Three of these letters at a time form a code word1 for proteinsynthesis.4.Three of these letters at a time form a tri gram, a primary image ofthe eight pos sible dynamic effects.5.The “direction” in which the code wordsare read is strictly determined (®)5.The “direction” in which the trigram isread is strictly determined ()6.There are 64 of these triplets known whoseproperty and informative “power” have been explored. One or more tripletsprogram the structure of one of the pos sible 22 amino acids; quite specific sequences of such triplets program the form and structure of all living creatures,from the amoeba to the iridescent peacock’s feather.6.There are 64 doubletrigrams precisely designated and described by Fu-Hsi (3000 B.C.) in very vividand precise images of highly specific dynamic states (e.g., “breakthrough” or“oppression”) with in each case six possible variations of this state andsubsequent transformation into another one of the 64 hexagrams — aprogram offate, as it were, in which each individual is at all times placed to oper atethe “switch” of fate, from which point onwards the “train” continues along itsappointed “line.”7.Two of these triplets have names: “begin ning” and “end.”They mark the begin ning and end of a code sentence of some length.7.Twohexagrams have names: before com pletion and after completion (frequentlyopening and closing “melodies of fate” in the oracle). Schönberger’s Table of DNA–I Ching Comparisons * The I Ching was discovered by Fu-Hsi in 3000 B.C. “through an insight intonature that defies our understanding.”323[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos696633] Indeed, it is becauseof this defiance of our understanding that much more may be at work than theaccidental, serendipitous discovery of an effective tool of divination, for aswe shall see, there may very well be a hidden Sumerian connection to the IChing.However, in order to appreciate this astounding connection, we must have a basicunderstanding of the structure of the I Ching itself and lay it side by sidewith the basic structure of DNA.Like DNA’s codons with their tripartite structure of information,324[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos696907] the I Ching’s systemof 64 symbols is built of a simple structure called trigrams, which arecombinations of three lines. The lines may be solid, or broken. There are eightsuch trigrams, and in the I Ching, these images are, in the words of the GermanI Ching scholar Wilhelm, “images of all that happens in heaven and on earth,”and as such, are representation of the tendencies of beings in movement. Theyrepresent “not objective entities, but functions.”325[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos697056] The I Chingfunctions, in other words, in a manner very similar to DNA, for both describethe possible actions of a given person, given a certain set of programmedinstructions inherent in the two systems.326[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos697797] Given all thesesimilarities between the I Ching and DNA, geneticist Gunther S. Stent wrote that“the congruence between it and the genetic code is nothing short of amazing.”327[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos698540] Indeed, it is soamazing that the chances of it being a statistical fluke are very small. The IChing may, in fact, be viewed as the “other half” of DNA.328[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos698690]This means that someone in ancient times knew something, and that thepossibility arises that Fu-Hsi did not discover the I Ching, but rather, thatthe I Ching is a legacy of some lost civilization and its science, for ancientChina certainly did not have sophisticated knowledge of the genetic code. Justwho did has already been seen from the ancient texts examined in the previouschapters: the Anunnaki.On this view, the I Ching becomes a “probability calculus,”329[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos698838] a kind of “psychiccomputer”330 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos698987] with itsown topology of “sequent events”331[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos699136] and even a catalogueof those events,332 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos699285]implying a kind of universal consciousness of which each person is acomponent.333 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos699559] Indeed,the physical medium not only becomes conscious in a certain sense, but is also —in another dramatic parallel with very modern views in physics — aninformation-creating medium.334[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos699713] This makes theuniverse a “gigantic organism” based upon a triadic structure underlying allthings, and even becomes the basis for tantric sex practices, practicesrationalized as a direct participation in the medium itself.335[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos699862]"},{"pageContent":"B. BACK TO THE TABLETS OF DESTINIES The strong and more than coincidental nature of the correspondences between theI Ching and DNA — and we have only surveyed but a few — raises the possibilitythat in looking at the two, we may be in fact looking at the fragments of a lostscience that once long ago existed in a higher order unity.336[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos700011] On this view, bothmodern genetics and the I Ching itself would be declined legacies of that higherorder unity.Given what has been said here, we may speculate on some of the properties ofthat “higher structured order” and its properties: (1) it will first be of ananalogical nature; (2) it will create information in the medium from a brokensymmetry; (3) it will have its own “torsion moment” or rotationalcharacteristics (mirrored in the spiral properties of the DNA helix).This is to say that the DNA of man interfaces directly with the physical mediumor aether in a manner that no other DNA of any other species does, making man avery powerful creature from a certain point of view... and a threat, which mightaccount for the fact that the “gods,” at least in the Mesopotamian legends,attempt to exterminate him once he was created. In any case, “Man” is, so tospeak, made in the image and likeness of the physical medium.337[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos700486]But what we are clearly looking at here is a higher order of structural unitythat was understood by someone in times that were already “ancient” beforeancient times, and we have already suggested where such knowledge and sciencecame from: the Anunnaki, and hence, there may be some connection between the IChing and the ancient cultures of Mesopotamia. The question is, what is it?There is one very obvious candidate: the Tablets of Destinies. These, as I havedetailed elsewhere,338[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos700817] were objects ofpower, made from some kind of stone or crystal, which enabled the fantastictechnologies of the “gods.” Moreover, they were also fantastic objects of powerand destruction, so fantastic, in fact, that whole wars were fought to possessthem, until finally, some of them were deliberately destroyed to prevent theiruse for warfare again.339[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos701108]The problem is, no one knows for sure exactly what they were, beyond the vaguedescriptions of stone-like or crystalline objects in those ancient texts.“Putting all [the] indications” from the ancient Mesopotamian texts together, Idecided to follow the clues to draw some speculative conclusions on what theymay have been. As I outlined in my book The Cosmic War, there were essentiallysix clues:> 1. They were, first of all, information, or objects containing information,> that allowed one to tap into “the power of the universe”;> 2. They were objects of technology that in use or conjunction with the “ekurs”> or “mountains of stone” — the ziggurats and pyramids of the ancient world —> allowed one to access that power, and thus wield a global hegemony by dint of> being able to manipulate that power in a variety of ways;> 3.

Their theft from Enlil by Anzu (or, earlier, by> Tiamat!) thus implies something quite important about the civilization of the> ancient “gods,” and that is, that the whole idea of “kingship” resided in the> implicit ability and threat to make use of this force.> 4.

Some MEs are also referred to as ME-LAM, or light-emitting, suggesting a> connection between the Tablets of Destinies and light, or electromagnetic> radiation. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the texts> indicate that after their theft, “radiance” disappeared.> 6. And finally, it will be noted that these particular MEs, from their first> theft by Tiamat to their subsequent theft by Anzu, and their brief (?) period> in the possession of Ninurta, exercise a peculiarly corrupting moral influence> on their possessors, gradually sapping their will and consuming them with the> obsessive desire to control and possess them...341> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos701454]There is, however, another clue about the Tablets of Destinies, and it is bothan important one, and one that moreover is a direct speculative conceptual linkto the I Ching:> ...(The) possessors of the Tablets are the least ambiguous concepts in the> whole textual and conceptual complex surrounding the mysterious objects. The> texts are clear about who possessed them, and more or less clear about the> order of their successive owners. These two things — the possessors and the> order of the possessors — afford the key that will unlock the riddle.342> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos701639] This connection to specific owners led me to speculate that “The Tablets ofDestinies appear to have been ‘activated’ only in physical proximity to theirpossessors,”343 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos701789] — inother words, they may have been activated by the certain specific sequences inthe DNA of their possessors, and given the fact that the I Ching is a system ofdivination with so many odd parallels to the genetic code itself, the connectionseems both logical and inevitable: With the I Ching, we may be looking at, so tospeak, the “software” remains of the Tablets of Destinies.344[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos701939]There is yet another possible connection between the I Ching and the Tablets ofDestinies, and it comes directly out of physics. Dr. Martin Schönberg, whosebook The I Ching and the Genetic Code we have been following here, remarks on apeculiar feature of the I Ching that was not even known or speculated aboutuntil the advent of modern quantum and nuclear physics:> The natural direction of rotation is clockwise and shows the sequence of the> year. However, it seems very strange to us to say that, knowing that which is> to come, depends on backward movement. We have a very long way to search in> Western science before we find the theory of “backward” movement, time> reversal, the disappearance and appearance of plus- and minus-charged> particles, and the calculation of future states, until there is mention of> anticlockwise rotation. In fact, we find it only when we come to the results> and theories of atomic physics — and of the DNA double helix. During the> intervening thousands of years of natural science, there is no mention of plus> and minus, time reversal, retrograde movement, clockwise and anticlockwise> movement, conversion of energy into matter — except in the natural philosophy> of the I Ching (no gods are needed!)345> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos702372]> > > > > > According to the I Ching doctrine of spatiotemporality, there should therefore> also be, unfolding from the seeds of the eight primary trigrams (the “world”> reading rightwards), a backward path, contrary to the natural order of events,> through which the seeds can be recognized, the past understood and the> law-governed development of the future predicted — a path which is open to the> wise man through his intuitive insight into the course of nature, in> accordance with the primary trigrams and their 64 combinations. ...346> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos702646]This idea of time reversal was also a crucial speculative conclusion that I hadarrived at concerning the Tablets of Destinies. After a careful examination ofthe implied physics of the texts that referred to the Tablets of Destinies, Iconcluded that they were components of a sophisticated phase conjugate mirrorable to manipulate the resonant harmonics of objects that exist in the physicalmedium itself.Thus, I concluded:> Grounded both in the ancient texts and a modern physics interpretation of> them, the Tablets of Destinies were most likely crystals of some sort through> which light or other electromagnetic energy was beamed, and these crystals> contained information. This information was the “holographic” interferometric> “grating” or “interference pattern,” Bearden’s quantum potential “template of> action,” the scalar signatures, of almost every celestial body considered> important in, to, and by the civilization of the “gods.” These priceless> catalogues were, moreover, compiled relative to our own solar system as their> physical frame of reference. Additionally, they included within their> catalogue of “gratings” or “templates” the “subtle influences” — as an> impressed dynamic — of consciousness. They most likely worked best, therefore,> when interfaced — by means now lost and unknown to us — with an intelligent> and conscious user.... The Tablets of Destinies were the “software” gratings> of phase conjugate mirrors for almost every celestial body that was considered> important to them...347> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos702920] As indicated above, it would appear that the I Ching is based on some lost andfragmented component of this science and may be the program by which theconsciousness of the users of the Tablets was integrated into the whole system.But what is a “phase conjugate mirror”? Briefly stated, it is a real opticaltechnology that really exists, and that was developed in part as a component ofPresident Ronald Reagan’s “Star Wars” or “Strategic Defense Initiative” in the1980s. To understand what a phase conjugate mirror does, one need onlyunderstand some simple optics, and why a phase conjugate mirror is such arevolutionary — and potentially deadly — technology.Part of the Strategic Defense Initiative consisted of the idea of orbitinghigh-powered lasers in space to shoot down Russian ICBMs upon detection in theearly launch stage of their trajectory. The problem was, as any physicist orengineer knew at the time, that atmospheric distortion of the laser beam wouldoccur, thus diminishing considerably the amount of power delivered to thetarget, and thus requiring that the laser would have to track and stay locked onthe target for a much longer period of time in order to destroy it.However, engineers came up with a way around the problem: phase conjugatemirrors. The idea was to shine two beams on the target and take a “picture” —quite literally, a hologram — of the interference pattern generated by theatmospheric distortion, and then use that hologram as a grid or template throughwhich to shine a laser beam. By doing so, the effects of the atmosphericdistortion were literally removed, as if the target beam was traveling backwardin time to arrive on the target with increased, rather than decreased,intensity. In fact, such waves from a phase conjugate mirror were oftentimescalled “time-reversed waves” in the literature.348[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos703100]The idea of phase conjugation may seem far removed from ancient China and its IChing, until one also recalls that the ancient Chinese tradition speaks of adeadly “weapon of the gods” called a “Yin-Yang” mirror! The name itself issignificant, for ordinarily, the primordial masculine Yang nature occurs first.By thus ordering the terms “Yin-Yang” and not “Yang-Yin,” the idea of a timereversal, of a system reversal, is inevitably implied. In other words, a phaseconjugate mirror!So what may we conclude from this all-too-brief excursion into physics anddivination?Clearly, someone in ancient times knew something about the profound connectionbetween the structure of DNA and the physical medium itself, and, in the wake ofsome primordial “Tower of Babel moment,” took steps to preserve a component ofthat knowledge.In short, we are, once again, dealing with a hidden elite in possession ofsophisticated knowledge, who are attempting to preserve that knowledge until theday that mankind was in a similar high scientific development, and could crackthe code.But there is another agenda at work as well...."},{"pageContent":"C.

Indeed, not all such reports of giants’ remains are Internet hoaxes,for on October 3, 1892, the New York Times ran a short article, based on a storyreported in the London Globe, that such remains had been discovered:> Race of Giants in Old Gaul From the London Globe> > In the year 1890 some human bones of enormous size, double the ordinary in> fact, were found in the tumulus of Castelnau, (Hérault,) and have since been> carefully examined by Prof. Kiener, who, while admitting that the bones are> those of a very tall race, nevertheless finds them abnormal in dimensions and> apparently of morbid growth. They undoubtedly open the question of the> “giants” of antiquity, but do not furnish sufficient evidence to decide it. Reports such as this abounded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.041 [images/00041.jpg]October 3, 1892 New York Times Article on Discovery of Giant Remains The problem is, while such reports and discoveries abounded, there was adeafening silence afterward on what those discoveries portended. In fact, thesilence was so deafening that after an initial report, the discoveries werenever reported nor commented upon again. This has led some to speculate thatthere is in fact a kind of “archaeological conspiracy” to cover up suchdiscoveries. The question assumes some significance, for if the ancient textsare to be believed, the offspring of the ancient “gods” and humans were giants,and hence, if there is such a cover-up, then this points to some possibleagendas at work, not only an ancient one, but a modern one, and perhaps, thesame one."},{"pageContent":"2. EGYPT IN ARIZONA One of those advocating such an “archaeology-gate” is the famous ancientanomalies researcher David Hatcher Childress. The beginning of the storyconcerns the alleged discovery of ancient Egyptian ruins in — of all places —none other than the Grand Canyon! The find was reported in a lengthy articlethat appeared in the April 5, 1909 edition of The Phoenix Gazette. The articleis lengthy, but it is worth citing in full.> Explorations in Grand Canyon> Mysteries of Rich Cavern Being Brought to Light> JORDAN IS ENTHUSED> Remarkable Finds Indicate Ancient People Migrated From Orient> > > > > > > The latest news of the progress of the explorations of what is now regarded by> scientists as not only the oldest archaeological discovery in the United> States, but one of the most valuable in the world, which was mentioned some> time ago in the Gazette, was brought to the city by G.E. Kinkaid, the explorer> who found this great underground citadel of the Grand Canyon during a trip> from Green River, Wyoming, down the Colorado River, in a wooden boat, to Yuma,> several months ago.> According to the story related to the Gazette, the archaeologists of the> Smithsonian Institute [sic], which is financing the explorations, have made> discoveries which almost conclusively prove that the race which inhabited this> mysterious cavern, hewn in solid rock by human hands, was of oriental origin,> possibly from Egypt, tracing back to Ramses. If their theories are borne out> by the translation of the tablets engraved with hieroglyphics, the mystery of> the prehistoric peoples of North America, their ancient arts, who they were> and whence they came, will be solved. Egypt and the Nile, and Arizona and the> Colorado will be linked by a historical chain running back to ages which> stagger the wildest fancy of the fictionist.> Under the direction of Professor S.A. Jordan, the Smithsonian is now pursuing> the most thorough explorations, which will be continued until the last link in> the chain is forged. Nearly a mile underground, about 1,480 feet below the> surface, the long main passage has been delved into, to find another mammoth> chamber from which radiates scores of passageways, like the spokes of a wheel.> Several hundred rooms have been discovered, reached by passageways running> from the main passage, one of them having been explored for 854 feet and> another 634 feet. The recent finds include articles which have never been> known as native to this country, and doubtless they had their origin in the> orient. War weapons, copper instruments, sharp-edged and hard as steel,> indicate the high state of civilization reached by these strange people. So> interested have the scientists become that preparations are being made to> equip the camp for extensive studies, and the force will be increased to> thirty or forty persons.> Before going further into the cavern, better facilities for lighting will have> to be installed, for the darkness is dense and quite impenetrable for the> average flashlight. In order to avoid being lost, wires are being strung from> the entrance to all passageways leading directly to large chambers. How far> this cavern extends no one can guess, but it is now the belief of many that> what has already been explored is merely the “barracks,” to use an American> term, for the soldiers, and that far into the underworld will be found the> main communal dwellings of the families. The perfect ventilation of the> cavern, the steady draught that blows through, indicates that it has another> outlet to the surface.> Kinkaid was the first white man born in Idaho and has been an explorer and> hunter all his life, thirty years having been in the service of the> Smithsonian. Even briefly recounted, his history sounds fabulous, almost> grotesque.> “First, I would impress that the cavern is nearly inaccessible. The entrance> is 1,486 feet down the sheer canyon wall.

A trip there would be fruitless, and the> visitor would be sent on his way. The story of how I found the cavern has been> related, but in a paragraph: I was journeying down the Colorado River in a> boat, alone, looking for mineral. Some forty-two miles up the river from the> El Tovar Crystal canyon, I saw on the east wall, stains in the sedimentary> formation about 2,000 feet above the river bed. There was no trail to this> point, but I finally reached it with great difficulty. Above a shelf which hid> it from view from the river, was the mouth of the cave. There are steps> leading from this entrance some thirty yards to what was, at the time the> cavern was inhabited, the level of the river. When I saw the chisel marks on> the wall inside the entrance, I became interested, secured my gun and went in.> During that trip I went back several hundred feet along the main passage, till> I came to the crypt in which I discovered the mummies. One of these I stood up> and photographed by flashlight. I gathered a number of relics, which I carried> down the Colorado to Yuma, from whence I shipped them to Washington with> details of the discovery. Following this, the explorations were undertaken.> The main passageway is about 12 feet wide, narrowing to nine feet toward the> farther end. About 57 feet from the entrance, the first side-passages branch> off to the right and left, along which, on both sides, are a number of rooms> about the size of ordinary living rooms of today, though some are 30 by 40> feet square. These are entered by oval-shaped doors and are ventilated by> round air spaces through the walls into the passages. The walls are about> three feet six inches in thickness. The passages are chiseled or hewn as> straight as could be laid out by an engineer. The ceilings of many of the> rooms converge to a center. The side-passages near the entrance run at a sharp> angle from the main hall, but toward the rear they gradually reach a right> angle in direction.> Over a hundred feet from the entrance is the cross-hall, several hundred feet> long, in which is found the idol, or image, of the people’s god, sitting> cross-legged, with a lotus flower or lily in each hand. The cast of the face> is oriental, and the carving shows a skillful hand, and the entire is> remarkably well preserved, as is everything in this cavern. The idol most> resembles Buddha, though the scientists are not certain as to what religious> worship it represents. Taking into consideration everything found thus far, it> is possible that this worship most resembles the ancient people of Thibet> [sic]. Surrounding this idol are similar images, some very beautiful in form;> others crooked-necked and distorted shapes, symbolical, probably, of good and> evil. There are two large cactus with protruding arms, one on each side of the> dais on which the god squats. All this is carved out of hard rock resembling> marble. In the opposite corner of this cross-hall were found tools of all> descriptions, made of copper. These people undoubtedly knew the lost art of> hardening this metal, which has been sought by chemists for centuries without> result. On a bench running around the workroom was some charcoal and other> material probably used in the process. There is also slag and stuff similar to> matte, showing that these ancients smelted ores, but so far no trace of where> or how this was done has been discovered, nor the origin of the ore.> Among the other finds are vases or urns and cups of copper and gold, made very> artistic in design. The pottery work includes enameled ware and glazed> vessels. Another passageway leads to granaries such as are found in the> oriental temples. They contain seeds of various kinds. One very large> storehouse has not yet been entered, as it is twelve feet high and can be> reached only from above. Two copper hooks extend on the edge, which indicates> that some sort of ladder was attached. These granaries are rounded, as the> materials of which they are constructed, I think, is very hard cement. A gray> metal is also found in this cavern, which puzzles the scientists, for its> identity has not been established. It resembles platinum. Strewn promiscuously> over the floor everywhere are what people call ‘cats eyes,’ a yellow stone of> no great value. Each one is engraved with the head of the Malay type.> On all the urns, or walls over doorways, and tablets of stone which were found> by the image are the mysterious hieroglyphics, the key to which the> Smithsonian Institute hopes yet to discover. The engraving on the tablets> probably has something to do with the religion of the people. Similar> hieroglyphics have been found in southern Arizona. Among the pictorial> writings, only two animals are found. One is of prehistoric type.> The tomb or crypt in which the mummies were found is one of the largest of the> chambers, the walls slanting back at an angle of about 35 degrees. On these> are tiers of mummies, each one occupying a separate hewn shelf. At the head of> each is a small bench, one of which is found copper cups and pieces of broken> swords. Some of the mummies are covered with clay, and all are wrapped in a> dark fabric. The urns or cups on the lower tiers are crude, while as the> higher shelves are reached the urns are finer in design, showing a later stage> of civilization.

Note the sheer amount of detail provided about the alleged discovery;> 2. Note the alleged involvement of the Smithsonian Institution;> 3. Note the alleged involvement of the cavern’s discoverer, G.E. Kinkaid, with> the Smithsonian; and finally,> 4. Note the alleged chief of the Smithsonian archaeological team, Professor> S.A. Jordan.These details have become the heart of what has been something of a minorcontroversy over the story ever since its first appearance. Was the story true?Or was it an elaborate hoax?David Hatcher Childress certainly belongs to the class of those who think it’strue, but with reservations. As Childress quips at the beginning of his article,“It was like the plot out of a fantasy Western movie...”350[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos703651] But there werequestions:> What became of the artifacts?

Has there been some archeological cover-up reminiscent of the last> scene in the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark where the Ark of the Covenant is> placed inside a crate in a giant warehouse never to be seen again?> It has also been suggested that while the discovery was real, the> archeologists working for the Smithsonian were not.

If so, what happened to them? In order to answerthose questions, one must determine whether or not the article was genuine, or ahoax."},{"pageContent":"3. HOAX OR COVER-UP? One of those questioning the entire story is Philip Coppens, who notes that thestory says little about Egypt, but that it points even further east:> [The] account is quite factual. Idols “resemble” Buddha, rather than “are”> Buddha. The worship “resembles” that of Tibet, not “is”... Kinkaid is trying> to use analogies to explain his discovery. It is the anonymous author of the> article who makes the connection with ancient Egypt and lets his mind float to> one of the biggest discoveries of all time.352> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos704055] Coppens is suggesting, in other words, that the anonymous author of thenewspaper article deliberately exaggerated the story, casting a pall ofsuspicion over just exactly what, if anything at all, was actually discovered.The fact that the newspaper never followed up on the sensational story raisesfurther suspicions.353[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos704386]But there was a further problem: the article made three explicit claims:> 1. that the discoverer of the cave, G.E. Kinkaid, worked for the Smithsonian> Institution;> 2. that the Smithsonian Institution was thus involved in the excavation and> recovery of the artifacts; and,> 3. that a professor of archaeology, one S.A. Jordan, was in charge of the> project.However, as Coppens observes, when contacted in 2000 for confirmation of theseallegations, the Smithsonian’s reply was unequivocal:> The Smithsonian Institution has received many questions about an article in> the April 5, 1909 Phoenix Gazette about G.E. Kinkaid and his discovery of a> “great underground citadel” in the Grand Canyon, hewn by an ancient race of> oriental origin, possibly from Egypt... The Smithsonian’s Department of> Anthropology has searched its files without finding any mention of a Professor> Jordan, Kinkaid, or a lost Egyptian civilization in Arizona. Nevertheless, the> story continues to be repeated in books and articles.354> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos704527] This would seem to be the end of the story......but no. Coppens admits that “there is room for a cover-up, of course,”355[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos704858] simply because it isa standard practice of such organizations to deliberately “look” for certainfiles in the wrong place. Not finding them in a certain place does not mean thatthey do not exist; they merely do not exist where the search was conducted:> The files do not necessarily have to be set within that department’s and the> reference to the Phoenix Gazette rather than Arizona Gazette could be a simple> error, or an escape valve that is so often present in official replies> engineered to debunk. Stories like “the CIA Division X has no record” often> means that Division Y is the one who has that record.356> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos704999] It is a ploy well known to researchers using FOIA requests to pry informationloose from various government departments.So the important question remains: if the entire newspaper story was a hoax, whoperpetrated it? And why?Coppens notes that if the original story was a hoax perpetrated by the newspaperitself — in the tradition of the yellow journalism of the day — in order togenerate more sales and circulation, then it is nothing less than bizarre thatit never followed up the story with a sequel. Thus it is unlikely that if thestory was a hoax, that the Arizona Gazette was the perpetrator, which leavesKinkaid himself.357 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos705140] Anumber of minor discrepancies exist in Kinkaid’s account that, while not provingthat he perpetrated a hoax, at least raise questions. 358[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos705471] “So where does thatleave us?” Coppens asks. His answer: somewhere in the middle, between a hoax andan exaggerated truth. In Coppen’s opinion, the discovery probably had more to dowith the discovery of artifacts of the ancient Anasazi American Indianculture.359 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos705612]This solution, however, raises as many questions as it answers. For one thing,the Anasazi culture was known to anthropology and archaeology at the time. Sowhy cover it up? The Smithsonian’s silence and claims of noninvolvement areequally suspicious, for it would have a natural and inherent interest in anyreporting of such a story, and would inevitably have investigated. This makesits blatant denials of any involvement highly suspicious.In an article entitled “Archaeological Coverup?” Jason Colavito makes thecomment — in support of the newspaper story being a complete hoax — that thearticle refers to the Smithsonian Institute and not the Smithsonian Institution,and that anyone claiming to work for it would know this. Colavito also arguesthat the original story in the Arizona Gazette is a single-source story withoutany other external corroboration, and thus argues that the whole thing is alikely hoax.360 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos705760]Childress, however, points out that the amount of specific detail in the articleplus the fact that it ran in an otherwise ordinary newspaper argues against thestory being a hoax. But for Childress the story is part of a much largerpicture, one of an “archaeological cover-up” of anomalous evidence andartifacts.Childress notes that> To those who investigate allegations of archaeological cover-ups there are> disturbing indications that the most important archaeological institute in the> United States, the Smithsonian Institute [sic], an independent federal agency,> has been actively suppressing some of the most interesting and important> archaeological discoveries made in the Americas.361> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos706068] There is an obvious fact here that is often overlooked: the U.S. government,like the Nazi Reich long afterward, and like many other governments of the majorpowers, established an official agency to do nothing but sponsor archaeologicalresearch. Thus, it stands to reason that like any other government agency, theSmithsonian would have its own “classified secrets.” The question is, why wouldsuch a seemingly staid and sober discipline and institution be keeping secrets?For Childress, the answer is rather simple: the Smithsonian had an agenda topromote a particular historical and anthropological paradigm, and to suppressevidence of another:> The cover-up and alleged suppression of archaeological evidence began in late> 1881 when John Wesley Powell, the geologist famous for exploring the Grand> Canyon, appointed Cyrus Thomas as the director of the Eastern Mound Division> of the Smithsonian Institution’s Bureau of Ethnology.> When Thomas came to the Bureau of Ethnology he was a “pronounced believer in> the existence of a race of Mound Builders, distinct from the American> Indians.” However, John Wesley Powell, the director of the Bureau of> Ethnology, a very sympathetic man toward the American Indians, had lived with> the peaceful Winnebago Indians of Wisconsin for many years as a youth and felt> that American Indians were unfairly thought of as primitive and savage.> The Smithsonian began to promote the idea that the Native Americans... were> descended from advanced civilizations and were worthy of respect and> protection.> They also began a program of suppressing any archaeological evidence that lent> credence to the school of thought known as Diffusionism, a school which> believes that throughout history there has been widespread dispersion of> culture and civilization via contact by ship and major trade routes.> The Smithsonian opted for the opposite school, known as Isolationism.> Isolationism holds that most civilizations are isolated from each other and> that there has been very little contact between them, especially those that> are separated by bodies of water. In this intellectual war that started in the> 1880s, it was held that even contact between the civilizations of the Ohio and> Mississippi Valleys were rare, and certainly these civilizations and did not> have any contact with such advanced cultures as the Mayas, Toltecs, or Aztecs> in Mexico and Central America.362> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos706393] But according to Childress, in addition to suppressing evidence supporting theDiffusionism hypothesis, the Smithsonian suppressed evidence of a very differentsort...A. DESTROYED AND SUPPRESSED EVIDENCE: CURIOUS NASA PARALLELS That evidence concerned the existence of the giants mentioned in ancient texts:> When the contents of many ancient mounds and pyramids of the Midwest were> examined, it was shown that the history of the Mississippi River Valleys was> that of an ancient and sophisticated culture that had been in contact with> Europe and other areas. Not only that, the contents of many mounds revealed> burials of huge men, sometimes seven or eight feet tall, in full armour with> swords and sometimes huge treasures.> ...> For instance, when Spiro Mound in Oklahoma was excavated in the 1930s, a tall> man in full armour was discovered along with a pot of thousands of pearls and> other artefacts [sic], the largest such treasure so far documented. The> whereabouts of the man in armour is unknown and it is quite likely that it> eventually was taken to the Smithsonian Institution.363> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos706718] The discovery of large “human” remains tends to support ancient Native AmericanIndian legends that asserted the existence of “monsters and giants” with whomthe Indians had once lived, legends which we will encounter later.At this juncture, Childress recounts a story that an anonymous researcherrelated to him, namely that the Smithsonian had dismissed one of its senioremployees for defending the “heresy” of Diffusionism, and for attempting to blowthe whistle on an operation where the Institution loaded a barge with anomalousevidence and literally sank it in the Atlantic to hide the evidence.364[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos707059] While Childressoffers no supporting evidence for this story, it is curious that it does fit awider pattern of the suppression of anomalous evidence of ancient sophisticatedcivilizations and their artifacts uncovered by another government agency: NASA.As space anomalies researchers Richard C. Hoagland and Mike Bara have pointedout, NASA’s own version of the “Smithsonian barge” included suchevidence-suppressing tactics as blacked-out thumbnail pictures in the NASAApollo photograph catalogues,365[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos707200] airbrushing and oth-erwise doctoring Apollo photos,366[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos707474] and —incomprehensibly — orders to Apollo archivists to actually destroy pricelessApollo photo archives, an order which was fortunately disregarded by oneindividual.367 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos707629] All ofthis evidence, as Hoagland and Bara observe, was strongly suggestive of thepresence of a high and technologically sophisticated civilization on the Moonand Mars. NASA was, in effect, following the same paradigm as Childresssuggested the Smithsonian was following: suppressing evidence of Diffusionism,only in this case, it was the ultimate in Diffusionism: the dispersal ofcivilization not only on planet Earth, but her neighbors as well.If there is a common motivation here between the two government agencies, then Iam bold to suggest that it lies in the common factor they each share, namelythat the existence of technological artifacts, of the skeletal remains ofgiants, and other anomalies, tended to corroborate that which ancient texts andtraditions had always maintained: there once was such a sophisticatedcivilization, that mankind himself is its deliberately engineered creation, andthere once were such things as giants. In short, anomalous evidence from space,and archaeological evidence from the Earth, that tended to corroborate suchancient myths, had to be suppressed. The question is, why? The answer will beencountered in the final chapter.B. THE SMITHSONIAN AND THE SUPPRESSION OF THE ALASKAN GIANTS There is another episode recounted by Childress that loosely corroborates theallegations of the Smithsonian’s suppression of anomalous archaeologicalevidence:> Ivan T. Sanderson, a well-known zoologist and frequent guest on Johnny> Carson’s Tonight Show in the 1960s... once related a curious story about a> letter he received regarding an engineer who was stationed on the Aleutian> island of Shemya during World War II. While building an airstrip, his crew> bulldozed a group of hills and discovered under several sedimentary layers> what appeared to be human remains. The Alaskan mound was in fact a graveyard> of gigantic human remains, consisting of crania and long leg bones.> The crania measure from 22 to 24 inches from base to crown. Since an adult> skull normally measures about eight inches from back to front, such a large> cranium would imply an immense size for a normally proportioned human.> Furthermore, every skull was said to have been neatly trepanned (a process of> cutting a hole in the upper portion of the skull).> In fact, the habit of flattening the skull of an infant and forcing it to grow> in an elongated shape was a practice used by ancient Peruvians, the Mayas, and> the Flathead Indians of Montana. Sanderson tried to gather further proof,> eventually receiving a letter from another member of the unit who confirmed> the report. The letters both indicated that the Smithsonian Institution had> collected the remains, yet nothing else was heard. Sanderson seemed convinced> that the Smithsonian Institution had received the bizarre relics, but wondered> why they would not release the data. He asks, “...is it that these people> cannot face rewriting all the textbooks?”368> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos707908] Notwithstanding the weighty credentials of Sanderson, himself a well-knowninvestigator of Fortean phenomena, many, however, still doubt the existence ofsuch coordinated archaeological cover-ups."},{"pageContent":"4. ARCHAEOLOGY-GATE: CREMO, THOMPSON, AND THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN Unfortunately for such individuals, decidedly more weighty evidence of sucharchaeological cover-ups was presented by Michael A. Cremo and Richard L.Thompson in their massive and magisterial study of the antiquity of mankind andhis artifacts, Forbidden Archeology: The Hidden History of the Human Race. Anyattempt to summarize this massive and scholarly tome of over nine hundred pageshere is simply impossible. We may, however, get some idea of their thesis,method, and the vast amount of evidence that they present to prove thatanatomically modern tool-making humans have been around for far longer thanstandard scientific dogma proclaims.They begin by observing that “...‘[Facts]’ turn out to be networks of argumentsand observational claims.”369[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos708233] Thus, “a piece ofevidence is anomalous only in relation to a particular theory,”370[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos708540] the theory in thiscase being evolution and all its implications for anthropology and the presumedreconstruction of the history and evolution of mankind. In this context thatthey ask the question that introduces the nine hundred pages of “anomalous”evidence that does not fit the standard theory:> What if, for example, fossils of anatomically modern humans turned up in> strata older than those in which the dryopithecine apes were found? Even if> anatomically modern humans were found to have lived contemporaneously with> Dryopithecus (or even a million years ago, 4 million years after the Late> Miocene disappearance of Dryopithecus), that would be enough to throw the> current accounts of the origin of humankind completely out the window.> In fact, such evidence has already been found, but it has since been> suppressed or conveniently forgotten...> ...

These includedcarved marble figures in strata that “suggests the characters were made byintelligent humans from the distant past,”373[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos709199] a section of goldthread found in strata between 320 and 360 million years old,374[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos709527] a report in anineteenth-century edition of Scientific American recording the discovery of ametallic vase in strata 600 million years old,375[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos709677] a chalk ball inFrance in strata 45–55 million years old,376[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos709832] a machined coin withundecipherable writing at least 200,000 years old, discovered in Illinois,377[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos709987] a clay figurinediscovered in Idaho that is at least two million years old.378[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos710142] The list ofsuppressed and conveniently forgotten discoveries goes on and on, and we shallhave occasion to refer to this list again in the final chapter, and in a verydifferent context.So why suppress or “conveniently forget” such evidences?In their remarks cited previously, Cremo and Thompson give one obvious answer:such evidence does not serve the reigning scientific dogma of evolution.It is when Cremo and Thompson’s careful scholarship is viewed within the contextof deeper allegations of archaeological suppression that other more disturbingphilosophical and speculative implications emerge, for the bottom line is thatboth the archaeological suppression of “convenient forgetting” and the dogma ofevolution would seem to be tailor-made devices to suppress the ideas of thegreat antiquity of man and the possibility of a previously existing Very HighCivilization. Viewed in this light, it is possible that the scientific theoryfunctions as an “evidence screening mechanism” for scientists not privy to theultimate agenda: the suppression of the very notion of such a civilization, andtherefore of any attempt to investigate it by the hoi polloi. One might indeedbe dealing with a “public consumption” biology, anthropology, and archaeology toparallel the “public consumption” physics deliberately designed to prevent therecovery of lost technologies and science.

Stories abound of the genetic alteration of food and seeds,with agribusiness companies like Monsanto leading the charge for the ridiculousidea of seeds for plants that will not reproduce... a nice way to control thefood supply. We are reminded of the great potentials for good in genetic curesfor the ravages of cancer, AIDS, diabetes and a host of other ailments, and ofthe great potential for evil in the genetic engineering of bio-weapons thattarget certain population groups with specific biological markers. Other storiesrecount the creation of what can only be described as science fiction: rabbitsand rats and cats that glow in the dark, mice growing human ears, human DNA putinto ordinary food products or artificial sweeteners or spliced into the genesof cattle and pigs.If we did not know better, we would think we were reading the ancientMesopotamian “creation” epic, the Enuma Elish, with its account of “scorpionmen,” or other ancient tales of Mesopotamia of the “fish god” Oannes, part fishand part man, and of other chimerical hybrids recounted in ancient texts and ofthe chimerical gods depicted in Egyptian and Mesopotamian art. When Alexanderthe Great’s empire was divided among his generals — with Mesopotamia going tothe Seleucids and Egypt to the Ptolemies — each of those new dynastiescommissioned “official histories” of their new realms in Greek, and solicitedexperts from within their realms to translate from their archives the essentialtexts. One of these was the Babylonian priest, scribe, and historian Berossus,whose Babylonaica survives only in fragmented quotations from his work cited bylater classical historians and church fathers.According to the early church historian Eusebius, who in turn is citingAlexander Polyhistor, Berossus stated:> There was a time in which there existed nothing but darkness and an abyss of> waters, wherein resided most hideous beings, which were produced of a two-fold> principle. There appeared men, some of whom were furnished with two wings,> others with four, and with two faces. They had one body but two heads: one> that of a man, the other of a woman; and likewise in their several organs both> male and female. Other human figures were to be seen with the legs and horns> of goats: some had horses’ feet; while others united the hind quarters of a> horse with the body of a man, resembling in shape the hippocentaurs. Bulls> likewise were bred there with the heads of men; and dogs with fourfold bodies,> terminated in their extremities with the tails of fishes; horses also with the> heads of dogs; men too and other animals with the heads and bodies of horses> and the tails of fishes. In short, there were creatures in which were combined> the limbs of every species of animals. In addition to these, fishes, reptiles,> serpents, with other monstrous animals, which assumed each other’s shape and> countenance. Of all which were preserved delineations in the temple of Belus> at Babylon.> The person who presided over them was a woman named Omoroca; which in the> Chaldaean language is Thalatth; in Greek Thalassa, the sea; but which might> equally be interpreted the Moon. All things being in this situation, Belus> came, and cut the woman asunder; and of one half of her he formed the earth,> and of the other half the heavens; and at the same time destroyed the animals> within her. All this (he says) was an allegorical description of nature. For,> the whole universe consisting of moisture, and animals being continually> generated therein, the deity above-mentioned took off his own head; upon which> the other gods mixed the blood, as it gushed out, with the earth; and from> thence were formed men. On this account it is that they are rational, and> partake of divine knowledge.... (Such, according to Polyhistor Alexander, is> the account which Berossus gives in his first book.)381> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos710869] Before analyzing this important passage, there is another fragment of Berossusthat must be mentioned, also a fragment from Alexander Polyhistor that survivesin the early church historian Eusebius:> (In the second book was contained the history of the ten kings of the> Chaldaeans, and the period of the continuance of each reign, which consisted> collectively of a hundred and twenty sari, or four hundred and thirty-two> thousand years; reaching to the time of the Deluge. For Alexander, enumerating> the kings from the writings of the Chaldaeans, after the ninth Ardates,> proceeds to the tenth, who is called by them Xisuthrus, in this manner:)> After the death of Ardates, his son Hizuthrus reigned eighteen sari. In his> time happened a great Deluge; the history of which is thus described. The> Deity, Cronus, appeared to him in a vision, and warned him that upon the> fifteenth day of the month Daesius there would be a flood, by which mankind> would be destroyed. He therefore enjoined him to write a history of the> beginning, procedure, and conclusion of all things; and to bury it in the city> of the Sun at Sipara; and to build a vessel, and take with him into it his> friends and relations; and to convey on board every thing necessary to sustain> life, together with all the different animals both birds and quadrupeds, and> trust himself fearlessly to the deep. Having asked the Deity, whither he was> to sail? he was answered, “To the Gods”; upon which he offered up a prayer for> the good of mankind. He then obeyed the divine admonition: and built a vessel> five stadia in length, and two in breadth. Into this he put every thing which> he had prepared; and last of all conveyed into it his wife, his children, and> his friends.> After the flood had been upon the earth, and was in time abated, Xisuthrus> sent out birds from the vessel; which, not finding any food, nor any place> whereupon they might rest their feet, returned to him again. After an interval> of some days, he sent them forth a second time; and they now returned with> their feet tinged with mud. He made a trial a third time with these birds; but> they returned to him no more; from whence he judged that the surface of the> earth had appeared above the waters. He therefore made an opening in the> vessel, and upon look-ing out found that it was stranded upon the side of some> mountain; upon which he immediately quitted it with his wife, his daughter,> and the pilot. Xisuthrus then paid his adoration to the earth; and having> constructed an altar, offered sacrifices to the gods, and, with those who had> come out of the vessel with him, disappeared.> They, who remained within, finding that their companions did not return,> quitted the vessel with many lamentations, and called continually on the name> of Xisuthrus. Him they saw no more; but they could distinguish his voice in> the air, and could hear him admonish them to pay due regard to religion; and> likewise informed them that it was upon account of his piety that he was> translated to live with the gods; that his wife and daughter, and the pilot,> had obtained the same honour. To this he added, that they should return to> Babylonia; and, as it was ordained, search for the writings at Sippara, which> they were to make known to all mankind....382> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos711150] The sirrush, recounted in chapter one, not only comes to mind reading thesetexts, but with the advent of genetic engineering techniques, has a very realpossibility of coming to life.And that’s the point, for if certain ancient texts can be interpreted alongtechnological lines and give hints and clues as to the existence of justprecisely such a genetic engineering technology in high antiquity, even beingused in the engineered creation of mankind himself as was seen in a previouschapter, then the horrible possibility arises that in reading about thoseancient accounts of chimeras and monsters, we might not be reading ancientscience fiction at all, but a reality, dimly remembered and passed down throughthe ages.However, there are a number of points to notice about these fragments fromBerossus that are quite important, for they play directly not only to theinterpretive method one brings to ancient texts, but, if one takes themseriously, raise many chronological problems that will be dealt with not onlyhere, but much more extensively in the next and final chapter. These points maybe summarized as follows:> 1. As noted, Berossus refers to creatures “of a two-fold principle,” i.e., to> chimerical hybrids. On the face of it, these are either the offspring of the> mytheological imagination, or, if one grants the existence of a sophisticated> technological society in high antiquity, were possibly the products of genetic> engineering;> 2. These creatures were in most instances a mixture of species, though in one> special instance, were masculo-androgynous mixtures of male and female humans,> an odd statement for an ancient text to make, since males carry both sexual> chromosomes;> 3. They were associated with “the sea,” a primordial abyss of waters that the> Greeks called “Thalassa.” In mythological terms, this is none other than the> goddess Tiamat;> 4. Tiamat, who created these “productions,” was destroyed by a god named> “Belus,” and from her remains the modern heaven and earth were fashioned.> Thus, Berossus is referring to the ancient war between Tiamat and Marduk,> recounted in the ancient Mesopotamian “war epic,” the Enuma Elish;383> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos711431]> 5. Mankind is specifically stated to be himself a chimerical creation from the> blood of a “god” (who had removed his head for the purpose!) and the earth,> dimly recalling the O’Briens’ technological interpretation of the Kharsag> tablets in chapter five, a fact that, if tested scientifically, should show up> in the genetic markers of humanity (not that we’ll ever be told about it!);> 6. The “Noah” character of the second passage cited — Xisuthrus — takes not> only his own family but his friends into his ark along with all the animals.> His family is specifically stated to have been “translated” to the gods,> leaving the remainder of the human family to descend from the friends he took> with him;> 7. Prior to entering the Ark, Xisuthrus is commanded to write the antediluvian> history of mankind and deposit it at Siparra, and upon conclusion of the> episode, his companions and friends return there to recover and disseminate> that history;> 8. The second passage cited makes specific reference to the god “Cronus,” the> ancient Greeks’ name for the planet Saturn, and Cronus, when queried by> Xisuthrus as to where he is to pilot his ark, is answered “to the gods,”> which, given the planetary reference, means off the “earth” entirely. This> extraterrestrial, interplanetary context is confirmed in loose fashion by> Xisuthrus’ family being “translated to the gods” after the deluge;> 9. The Deluge is stated to have occurred some four hundred and thirty-two> thousand years ago, long before the rise of the societies recording the event,> and, as we shall see from the genetic evidence to be presented in the next> chapter, long before the rise of modern Homo sapiens sapiens;> 10. The war of the gods (Tiamat and Marduk, or Thalassa and Belus as they are> called in Berossus), occurred prior to the deluge, and moreover, a subsequent> war was associated with some “Tower of Babel moment”: “They say that the first> inhabitants of the earth, glorying in their own strength and size, and in> despising the gods, undertook to raise a tower whose top should reach the sky,> and in the place in which Babylon now stands; but when it approached the> heaven, the winds assisted the gods, and overthrew the work upon its> contrivers; and its ruins are said to be still at Babylon: and the gods> introduced a diversity of tongues among men, who till that time had all spoken> the same language; and a war arose between Cronus and Titan.”384> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos711926] Notably, the> language of this fragment of Berossus is oddly ambiguous, for the first> inhabitants of the earth are referred to not as “men” but merely> “inhabitants,” and then he subsequently refers to them as “men.” These “first> inhabitants” are also referred to as glorying in their “size,” a statement> which lends credence to the idea that they were of large stature. Finally> reference is made to the war between Cronus (Saturn), and Titan, who of course> in the Greek version of this war sired a race of giants.> 11. It is to be noted that some of the references in Berossus (as well as in> the Enuma Elish) are astrological: e.g. “scorpion men” in the Enuma Elish,> “centaurs” in Berossus.Of course, all this is rather breathtaking stuff... if one reads it “literally”and as containing glimmers of a technological past only dimly remembered. Ifread that way it presents numerous chronological and scientific difficulties, aswe shall discover in the next and final chapter.What is important to note here is the agenda that these ancient texts suggest isin place in modern times, for with modern experiments in “manimals” and thecreation of other chimerical creatures, it would appear as a possibility thatsomeone has an agenda to (re-)create the chimerical creatures of ancient mythand astrological lore. If so, then the one possible motivation for doing so isalso perhaps suggested by those ancient myths: someone is attempting to createthe conditions and lost technology of the ancient war against the “giants andmonsters.”But there is the other possibility of interpretation of these ancient texts, themythological one, and its own problematical difficulties may be revealed byasking a simple question: What did the ancients themselves think when theyencountered the fossilized bones of large humanoid beings, or of dinosaurs? Toanswer this question, we must travel from Mesopotamia to Greece, and from there,across the ocean to North America, where two unlikely traditions — the Greek andthe Native American Indian — give oddly parallel answers, answers thatultimately, and if read carefully, do not support a standard academic and“mythological” interpretation. As this careful comparison will reveal, there areastonishing similarities of traditions from places in the world otherwisedisconnected from each other."},{"pageContent":"A. GREEKS, GIANTS, MONSTERS, AND WAR One scholar who has been collecting precisely such accounts, legends andtraditions, and doing so with a great deal of skill and analytical thoroughness,is Adrienne Mayor. Her works, Fossil Legends of the First Americans and TheFirst Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times, are not only theonly such thorough studies, they are magisterial catalogues of obscurereferences and traditions all but forgotten to paleontological science.385[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos712204]"},{"pageContent":"1. THE GIGANTOMACHY, OR THE WAR AGAINST THE GIANTS The best place to afford an entry into the subject of Graeco-Roman responses tofossil remains is in the myth of the gigantomachy, the war between the Greekgods and the Titans, or giants. The “Titan wars” or wars against the giantsbegan when the first “supreme god” of the pantheon, Cronos (Saturn) and hisconsort Rhea gave birth to Zeus and his siblings. Zeus in turn, with theassistance of the Titans, overthrew Cronos as supreme god and thus ushered inthe era of the Olympian gods of classical Greek mythology. Then began the “TitanWars” or wars of the giants, as some of the older giants and monsters waged war“against Zeus and the new, more human, gods.”386[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos712580] This point aboutmonsters, giants, and “more human” gods is an important one, and we shall bereturning to it again in this and the next chapter.At this juncture, Zeus defeated the giants by throwing his lightning bolts,destroying the giants’ legions and their leader, Typhon.387[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos712772] Interestingly enough,the locations on earth where these titanic battles were alleged to have occurredare often found near fossil fields dotted throughout the eastern Mediterranean,and particularly in Greece.388[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos713060] In other words, theancients explained their encounters with fossils by interpreting them from thestandpoint of their preexisting myths.Interestingly enough, however, the key to the giants is their chimerical nature:> In early Greek art, giants were imagined as quadruped monsters, or as> warriors, huge ogres, or primitive strongmen armed with tree trunks and> boulders; some later artists added serpent legs to symbolize their earth-born> nature. It’s important to keep in mind that giants were not necessarily> visualized as human.389> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos713248] In other words, the Gigantomachy was a literal war, a struggle for survivalbetween at least two different species, one an older race of “monsters andogres,” and the other the new “more human” Olympian gods. This will be animportant clue in resolving the problems presented by modern genetics andancient texts, as will be seen in the next chapter. For now, we note once againthat the struggle, read at face value, is between two species, one less, and onemore, “human.”Mayor cites an impressive list of classical sources attesting to the ancients’perceptions of these giants as “deformed” creatures, from Flavius Josephus,390[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos713447] Manilius,391[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos713918] to the church fathersClement of Rome,392 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos714297]and Augustine of Hippo.393[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos714447] Two of the classicalsources Mayor cites are worth mentioning in more detail, however.Diodorus Siculus observes in his Library that the giants “Started a war againstthe gods... and were completely exterminated.” The one doing the exterminatingwas, according to Diodorus, Heracles, a.k.a. Aries, Mars, Errakal, or, in theBabylonian tradition, Nergal.394[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos714602] Notably, thetradition of the “gods” annihilating the giants is dimly reflected in thebiblical tradition, where Yahweh orders the extermination of the populations ofCanaan during the Hebrew conquest, a population that according to the biblicaltext is of giant stature.395[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos714752]The other interesting source is Herodotus, whose credentials as an accuratehistorian are, to say the least, a matter of hot debate within modern academiccircles. In Herodotus’ case, the example Mayor cites is of a coffin over tenfeet long, in which was found a skeleton of a “man” as long as the coffin.396[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos715078] One may take this atface value, or rationalize that the “skeleton” was of some unknown creaturewhose bones had been arranged to look like a hominid, but really was not."},{"pageContent":"2. THE GRIFFIN The latter strategy of rationalization is that followed by Mayor in afascinating examination of the legendary creature, the griffin. Noting that thegriffin played no real role in Greek mythology,397[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos715261] nonetheless there areartistic depictions of such creatures in Greek art. One of the most interestingaspects of accounts of griffins according to Mayor is both their consistency,398[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos715410] and the fact thatthey were consistently described as guarding “treasures.”399[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos715559] Seeking a scientificexplanation for this consistency and the origin of these legends, Mayor tracesit back to the Gobi Desert tracer gold fields, and to the fact that the samefields exhibit fossils of the dinosaur protoceratops, which bears a strongresemblance to the griffin.400[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos715708]"},{"pageContent":"3. MAYOR’S INTERPRETIVE PARADIGM The problem of the griffin highlights the same problem we encountered in chapterone — the sirrush — and the academic agendas in place to deal with suchproblems. For Mayor, the answer lies in the “mythological paradigm” itself:> If some nonhuman features were detected in fossil assemblage, they could be> explained by the mythological paradigm. Everyone knew that giants and heroes> of myth were not merely bigger and stronger than ordinary humans, but they> could also have grotesque anatomical features, such as multiple heads or> animal parts.401 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos715862] Just how this paradigm works out practically can be seen in Mayor’s other signalstudy of such mythologies, Fossil Legends of the First Americans."},{"pageContent":"B. INDIANS, GIANTS, MONSTERS, AND WAR"},{"pageContent":"1. THE AGE AND WAR OF THE GIANTS AND MONSTERS The tradition of monsters, giants, and of a “war with the giants” is mirrored inthe unlikely place of Native American Indian traditions and legends. As with thetraditions of giants and gigantomachy in the eastern Mediterranean, Mayor notesthat it is necessary, when viewing these Indian legends and traditions, to “keepin mind that in many Native traditions, ‘giants’ of ancient eras were oftenunderstood to be primeval beings that were neither animal nor human.”402[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos716050] That said, thisindigenous Native American tradition is very rich and diverse.Like the early colonial Christians in North America who sought to interpretfossil evidence within the context of biblical stories of creation, theNephilim, and the Flood,403[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos716254] Native AmericanIndians, when encountering such bones and other evidence, “turned to mythictraditions about giants and monsters to account for them...”404[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos716403] The uniformity ofthis tradition of ancient giants and monsters across different tribes evencalled forth a comment from the famous Puritan Cotton Mather.405[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos716552] As for their Puritancounterparts, the Indians, like the Greeks, interpreted such fossil evidencewithin the context of their already-existing tribal traditions about humanprehistory. The method in both cases is identical.There are but two logical ways in which to view such traditions, be theybiblical, Sumerian, or Native American, and they are that (1) either the mythswere created by those cultures to explain such fossil evidence; or (2) the mythswere handed down to such cultures and contained some kernel of actual historicaltruth, or to put it somewhat more provocatively, the myths pre-existed both theevidence which was to be encountered and interpreted, and the cultures thatwould encounter and interpret it. This is a phenomenon we have alreadyencountered with the Greeks, and to a certain extent, it is true of all culturesof ancient times and their attempts to understand and interpret such evidence.Needless to say, the first alternative is that favored by academia and may bedesignated “the standard view.” As we proceed with our survey of Native Americantraditions, however, we shall see that there are a number of things that suggestthat the second alternative, for all its radical nature, is the more rationalalternative, and one deserving of a detailed exploration.Just as for the Greeks across the Atlantic, the nature of the giants was not asettled matter for Native Americans. In some traditions, the giants were said tobe made of stone and lived almost 1300 years before the arrival of Columbus,according to the Iroquois scholar David Cusick;406[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos716701] in others, the giantswere “humanoid” creatures,407[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos716905] and there weredebates within, and differences between, traditions over whether or not thegiants were even hostile or indifferent to humans.408[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos717054]There is an amazing consistency of Native American traditions regarding the “ageof the giants and monsters” and in some traditions, the war that was foughtagainst them. Again, according to the Iroquois scholar David Cusick, the“northern giants, called Ronnongwetowanea, had harassed the early Iroquois inthe past, but the giants all died out about twenty-five hundred winters beforeColumbus discovered America.”409[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos717203] Running these numbers(1492 - 2500 = 1008 B.C.) places the Native American account of the extinctionof the giants and the end of the “age of giants” at very roughly the same periodof time as biblical accounts of the Hebrew conquest of Canaan, in which giantswere a specific target for extinction.410[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos717352] Other Iroquois tribesplaced the death of the last giant at eight to ten generations prior to 1705,411[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos717819] again, in a timeframe roughly consistent with other Native American traditions and broadlyconsistent with similar legends from the Middle East.One of the most intriguing, and as we shall discover, most important, featuresof Native American traditions and legends concerning the giants and monsters isthe fact that many of these traditions taught the idea that various “past ages(were) distinguished by different kinds of creatures,” a belief that was “along-standing concept in many Native American traditions, and discoveries ofunusual vertebrate fossils would certainly reinforce the idea.”412[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos718014]Among the Aztecs in Mexico, this idea found further expansion, and in theexpansion, an eerie parallel with the Mesopotamian and Middle Eastern accountssuggestive of an engineered humanity:> In Aztec mythology, there were four previous ages of the world, each destroyed> by a different cataclysm: flood, earthquake, hurricane, and fire. The first> age was dominated by the earth-giants, followed by three ears of primitive> humans. The Aztecs believed that inhabitants of the later worlds sometimes> encountered terrifying giants who were relict survivors of the great flood and> earthquakes that had destroyed the past worlds. To re-create life in the> present, fifth age, the Feathered Serpent god Quetzalcoatl retrieved the> scattered and broken bones of the human ancestors destroyed in the fourth age.> He ground the bones to powder in a jade mortar. Mixed with blood donated by> the gods, these bones produced today’s humans.413> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos718225] There are a number of very important points to note here.Firstly, the Aztec tradition is broadly consistent with North American NativeAmerican traditions of different ages distinguished by different creatures,which suggests three possibilities for the resemblance: (1) either bothtraditions stem from a common and earlier source; or (2) all Native Americancultures were in much closer contact with each other than the Isolationistschool championed by the Smithsonian and “official archaeology and anthropology”would have it; or (3) some combination of (1) and (2) was true. It should benoted that if the Isolationist interpretation were true, then option (1) wouldbe a way to explain it, but this would present academia’s “standard view” withthe problem of having to explain why so many disparate tribal traditionsmaintained the concept with such consistency over a wide area and prolongedperiod, and “independently” of one another. Conversely, if the disparatetraditions did not spring from a common source, then how would one account forthe amazing similarity of “the mythological imagination” over such a wide area —a similarity, moreover, that bears amazing resemblances to modern evolutionarytheory? In other words, the consistency of the concept itself strongly suggestsa scientific basis from which the various mythologies arose, and thus suggests atime and culture antedating the Meso- and North American Native traditions andstemming from very high antiquity.Secondly, within the Aztec tradition, explicit mention is made of differenttypes of pre-existing humanity, a conception well in keeping with modernevolutionary theory concerning the origins of modern Homo sapiens sapiens, withone very important exception, and that is that modern mankind in the Aztectradition, as in the Mesopotamian, is an engineered creature, and one moreoverthat is chimerical, i.e., composed of a part from “the gods” and a part from thepre-existing and more primitive “humans.” Even the details of mankind’s creationare eerily parallel with the Kharsag tablets and the interpretation of theO’Briens examined previously, for we have (1) a grinding of the bones to apowder, paralleling the O’Briens’ creation of a culture, and (2) the “donation”of the blood — meaning perhaps the semen emissions — of the “gods” to thehybridized creature. Again, the details of the Aztec creation myth suggestivelypoint to a technological basis and to an engineered, and not to an evolvedhumanity.Finally, in yet another odd parallel with the Middle East, the Aztecs believedthat some of the giants survived the Flood. In this, there is also generalalignment with the traditions of more northern Native American nations whichbelieved that the wars with the giants were a post-flood event.The tradition extended beyond the Iroquois in North America or the Aztecs inMexico. For example, as Cortez and his men marched westward into Mexico towardthe Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, they encountered the tribe of the Tlaxcaltecs orTlascala Indians, who recounted for Bernal Diaz del Castillo, one of Cortez’scaptains, that> A very long time ago, their forefathers found the territory inhabited “by men> and women of great size, people with huge bones.” The ancestors had fought and> destroyed these “wicked and evil” beings — and “any of the giants who survived> eventually died out.” This last detail reveals that the Tlaxcaltecas> understood that even if a small number of relict creatures had escaped mass> destruction, they would eventually face extinction.414> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos718394] Again, the legend compels the observation that the Tlaxcalteca account isremarkably parallel with the biblical account of the conquest of Canaan by theHebrews, in that both peoples (1) encounter giant humanoid occupants of theland, and (2) wage war against them because these giants are “wicked and evil.”This observation compels three further questions: Are we looking at a “conquest”that occurred in more than one place but for the same reasons? If so, then weare probably looking at coordinated action and an agenda, namely, a genocidalwar for the extinction of a certain race or species of “giants.”Or alternatively, are we looking at dim memories in either case of oneunderlying event that occurred in the dim mists of “pre-history,” or are welooking at some combination of both? If the latter two cases be true, then thisin turn would perhaps have a wide and profound impact on how the editing ofbiblical and other Middle Eastern texts is understood to have occurred, andmight even suggest possible reasons for why it was undertaken.Note also that the tradition here is clear: the occupants that the Tlazcaltecaencountered were living human-like creatures of large stature. They were notmerely fossilized bones that were interpreted in accordance with a pre-existingmyth. This will become an important point in a moment.The Aztecs added to this “giant lore” when, during their migrations into lowerMexico, they encountered ca. 1200 A.D. the abandoned city of Teotihuacan, thefamous giant pyramid complex outside of modern Mexico City. Seeing thesegigantic structures, they interpreted them as having been built by the giantsduring the age of the giants.415[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos718593] The Aztec princeFernando de Alba Ixtlilxochitl maintained that these giants were “earth-giants,”in a manner recalling the far-distant Iroquois’ “stone giants,” and that theywere somehow deformed.416[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos718788]Even farther south in Latin America, the Incas had similar traditions of giants,monsters, and wars, and explained “colossal skeletons as the vestiges ofdangerous giants of antiquity.”417[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos718929] Cieza de Leonconducted interviews with local Manta Indians in Ecuador, and they hadtraditions that “Had been received from their ancestors from very remotetimes”418 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos719078] that a raceof giants had arrived on the coast of such stature that ordinary men came uponly to the knees.419 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos719219]Here again one encounters a story with odd and out-of-place resemblances to yetanother biblical story, from an entirely different tradition an ocean away. DeLeon, in his recounting of the Native traditions, insisted> that because of their vile sexual habits, the giants were “detested by the> natives,” who made war against the invaders in vain. At last God intervened,> and while the giants “were all together engaged in their accursed [words> omitted], a fearsome and terrible fire came down from heaven with a great> noise. At one blow, they were all killed, and the fire consumed them.”420> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos719360] While one is left guessing what the “vile sexual habits” might be, theresemblance to the biblical story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah isquite strong, and this suggests a rather unique twist to the latter, for if bothtraditions come from some common underlying source and represent fragments of aonce-unified story or legend, then perhaps the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrahhas less to do with the conventional religious and moral explanations and moreto do with the presence of giants, or conversely, perhaps the destruction of thegiants in the Americas had something to do with the morality of Sodom andGomorrah."},{"pageContent":"2. THE CONSISTENCY OF NATIVE AMERICAN EXPLANATIONS What emerges from all this is the amazing consistency of Native Americantraditions concerning the age of giants and monsters, for with the exception ofthe Tlaxcaltecas noted previously, “Native American traditions about giants andimmense land animals indicated that such creatures had never been seen alive inthe present age, that the huge beasts had disappeared long ago...”421[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos719501] Moreover, “TheNatives’ story was consistent: (fossilized bones) were the vestiges of a giantrace, now extinct owing to natural catastrophe or battles with humans of thedistant past.”422 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos719650] Inthis respect, Native Americans had a tradition that interpreted the evidencethey encountered in a manner remarkably similar to the Greeks, who had their owntraditions of giants, monsters, and ancient wars against both."},{"pageContent":"3. MAYOR’S EXPLANATION Mayor’s scholarly credentials and the caliber of her research are impeccable.Not surprisingly, she follows a standard academic interpretation of the NativeAmerican traditions. Citing again the case of the Tlaxcaltecas who recountedtales of giants pulling down trees “as if they had beene stalkes [sic] oflettices [sic],” she notes that such behavior is similar to that of elephants,and that such details “may have originated in ancestral memories of Columbianmammoths and may have been later confirmed by discoveries of fossils.”423[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos719799] Similarly, all suchtales of giants’ remains might simply be explicable as misinterpreted fossilizedbones of “monsters” or dinosaurs.424[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos719948] For Mayor, the bottomline seems to be that the myths were created to explain the evidence.But the problem, as we saw — at least in the case of the Tlaxacaltecas (if notothers) — was that the legend explicitly stated that their ancestors firstencountered humanoid giants as living creatures, and the Tlaxcaltecas were noless rational than anyone else, and would hardly be prone to confuse humanoidbeings with mammoths.The other problem is that if the myths were created to explain the evidence,then why did cultures as diverse as the Greeks, Iroquois, Aztecs and so on,creates myths remarkably similar in their details?"},{"pageContent":"4. THE ANCIENT TRADITIONS AND THE ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION Thus, there are certain factors that suggest that an alternative view of thesetraditions, myths, and legends is necessary, one in which it is assumed thatthey contain kernels of historical and scientific truth:> 1. The belief among some Indian tribes and nations that different ages were> exhibited and inhabited by different types of creatures, including different> types of humanity;> 2. The consistency with which Native Americans pointed to fossils as evidence> of the truth of their traditions and myths concerning the age of giants and> monsters (a fact that, again, would indicate that the myths predate the> cultures encountering the evidence);> 3. The belief of different ages being typified by different kinds of creatures> and humans, coupled with the consistency of their understanding of fossils as> coming from antiquity and a war of giants and monsters, suggests not that the> Indians invented the myths to explain the bones, but rather that the origin of> those myths and traditions stems from the time of the dinosaurs themselves,> for if such myths contained any kernel of truth, then at some point they had> to be based on contemporaneous observation.Why is this so? Why must one entertain the possibility that these myths andtraditions stem from the time of the dinosaurs themselves?Look carefully at point number one above, for such a viewpoint is remarkablysimilar to the ideas of modern evolutionary theory and modern anthropology.Indeed, there is little if anything to distinguish the American Indian views,when reduced to the barest elements, from the views of modern science. Thelegends and myths, in other words, suggest an origin within a culture far morescientifically sophisticated than those Indian tribes which preserved them, andthat means in turn that the origin of these traditions is very, very ancient,or, to put it in the terms I have used elsewhere, “paleoancient.” Indeed, ifthey originate from such a culture and more or less contemporaneously with theevents described, then they antedate modern mankind himself.To put it as succinctly and nakedly as possible, the Native American Indiantraditions are older than modern mankind himself and thus predate the tribesthat preserved them. And this act must be considered to be an act of“preservation” and not “creation” simply because the scientific sophisticationthey suggest could not have originated within those tribes and cultures.425[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos720097]This observation, plus the observations of all previous chapters, now suggeststhat two stunning and mutually opposed agendas might be in play “from highantiquity”:> 1.

Cremo and Richard L. Thompson426[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos720795] EUROPE IS POPULATED by approximately six hundred and fifty million Caucasians,as of this writing. No news there. The news is that all of them, along withtheir American, Canadian, and Australian descendents across the seas, are“cousins.” The reason is that Bryan Sykes, a geneticist at the University ofOxford,427 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos721046] discoveredan amazing thing: all Europeans come from only seven different clan mothers, orThe Seven Daughters of Eve as he calls them, which is the title of hisfascinating book surveying his research and conclusions. Those seven differentclan mothers all in turn come from one common mother, “mitochondrial Eve” as thegeneticists call her, as indeed, do all humans now alive on the planet.If this sounds like good news to the biblical literalist, it isn’t, but we’llget to that later. The real news, here as elsewhere, is in the genes, and whatthey tell us about human origins and prehistory. Sykes, with much more eloquenceand elegance than most scientists, puts it this way:> ...(Each) of us carries a message from our ancestors in every cell of our> body.

MITOCHONDRIAL EVE AND HER SEVEN EUROPEAN DAUGHTERS"},{"pageContent":"1. EARLY ATTEMPTS TO DISTINGUISH RACIAL GROUPS BY BLOOD-TYPING This “handful of women” were in fact seven women, seven “genetic clan mothers”to whom Sykes gave the names Ursula, Xenia, Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine, andJasmine.431 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos722060] But thequest for science to find and identify these seven genetic clan mothers ofEurope was no easy matter.It began with the first blood transfusions in Italy in the seventeenth century.432 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos722211] Many people diedfrom reactions to these early attempts and the practice was discontinued for twomore centuries until it was resumed again in the nineteenth century to try tosave the lives of women hemorrhaging during childbirth. It was the practice oftransfusions, in other words, that led to the discovery of the different bloodtypes of humanity by the biologist Karl Landsteiner in 1900.433[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos722360]Blood-typing quickly became an acceptable way of determining paternity and,ultimately, of the attempt to trace the genetic and evolutionary origins ofdifferent groups of humanity. According to Sykes, the attempt began in earnestduring World War I, and “to a scientific paper delivered to the Salonika MedicalSociety on 5 June 1918.”434[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos722509]Because the genetics of inherited blood types was rather straightforward, theattempt to classify racial groups by blood types was soon underway. On the basisof the transfusion data collected during World War I, it was soon discoveredthat Europeans were made up of about 15 percent blood type B and 40 percentblood type A. But these proportions changed the further East into Russia thatone went, where blood type B was proportionally higher in soldiers drawn fromRussia and Africa, with the proportion peaking to about 50 percent in soldiersfrom India serving with the British. This led some researchers to conclude thatthere were two basic or early “bio-chemical racial groups,” A and B, based onblood typing.435 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos722693]But problems with this method quickly arose. For example, one result showedalmost identical blood type frequencies occurring in soldiers from Russia assoldiers from Madagascar! As Sykes quips, was this “genetic evidence for ahitherto unrecorded Russian invasion of Madagascar, or even the reverse, anoverwhelming Malagasy colonization of Russia?”436[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos722842] Other results showedfrequencies nearly identical between the English and the Greeks. These types ofproblems grew so acute that the American physician William Boyd eventuallyissued a warning to anthropologists to disregard blood types as any reliableindicator of the genetic history of humanity and its different races.437[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos722991]"},{"pageContent":"2. THE BASQUES, RH POSITIVE AND RH NEGATIVE BLOOD, AND THE “PROBLEM OF EUROPE” At this juncture, there was another genetic monkey wrench thrown into the works:the Basques. I have always been fascinated by the Basques, because, being partBasque myself on my mother’s side of the family, their strange relationship tothe rest of Europe is somehow part of my own personal ancestry and story. TheBasques inhabit the area of the now long-defunct Kingdom of Navarre in thecorner of the Bay of Biscay in the area where the modern borders of France andSpain touch.The problem for anthropology that they pose is twofold, for on the one hand, theBasques are the European continent’s “most influential genetic population,” andon the other, their language, Euskara, “is unique in Europe in that it has nolinguistic connection with any other living language.”438[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos723132] But they also provideSykes and his research team “with an invaluable clue to the genetic history ofthe whole of Europe...”439[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos723316]The clue comes through the different Rh positive and Rh negative blood types.Most people are aware of the severe complications that can occur for a newbornbaby born of an Rh positive and an Rh negative pair of parents. “Blue babysyndrome” was a common occurrence of births for European peoples until thisdistinction was discovered, and Rh negative mothers married to Rh positivehusbands were given injections of antigens that neutralized the mother’s immunesystem reaction to it and hence protected her child from accidental circulationsof both kinds of blood in her baby.440[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos723519]The problem was that while most of the rest of the world was overwhelmingly Rhpositive, in Europe alone there was a nearly equal mixture of both Rh positiveand Rh negative types. And this “did not make any evolutionary sense.”441[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos723672]It is at this juncture that the Basques assumed a crucial role in the story, forin 1947 the English physician Arthur Mourant decided to study the problem posedby the Basques more closely. The results were somewhat astonishing, as Sykesexplains:> It was already known that Basques had by far the lowest frequency of blood> group B of all the population groups in Europe. Could they be the ancient> reservoir of (Rh) negative as well? In 1947 Mourant arranged to meet with two> Basques who were in London attempting to form a provisional government and> were keen to support any attempts to prove their genetic uniqueness. Like most> Basques, they were supporters of the French Resistance and totally opposed to> the fascist Franco regime in Spain. Both men provided blood samples and both> were (Rh) negative. Through these contacts, Mourant typed a panel of French> and Spanish Basques who turned out, as he had hoped, to have a very high> frequency of (Rh) negatives, in fact, the highest in the world. Mourant> concluded from this that the Basques were descended from the original> inhabitants of Europe, whereas all other Europeans were a mixture of originals> and more recent arrivals, which he thought were the first farmers from the> Near East.> From that moment, the Basques assumed the status of the population against> which all ideas about European genetic prehistory were to be — and to a large> extent still are — judged. The fact that they alone of all the west Europeans> spoke a language which was unique in Europe, and did not belong to the> Indo-European family which embraces all other languages of western Europe,> only enhanced their special position.442> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos723856] In other words, of all the population groups in Europe, the evidence appearedquite strong that the Basques were somehow “original” to the continent, or,better put, the group that had been there the longest and had arrived before theothers.The next step forward came, of course, with the discovery of the double helixstructure of DNA itself, and with the technologies associated with geneticsequencing. Here at last was a technique that would allow scientists to staredown the long spiral and peer into the histories of various human groups. Bycomparing massive amounts of DNA and statistically quantifying certain clustersor sequences in the DNA, geneticists could derive an idea of the “geneticdistance” between groups. The farther apart two groups were genetically, themore distant in the past any common ancestry was likely to be.443[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos724009]Doing so, however, threw yet another monkey wrench into the works, for over andover again, in different racial groups, individuals would appear in one groupwhose closest genetic relatives were in an entirely different group.444[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos724193] Genetics, in otherwords, had blurred the traditional anthropological classifications based onrace, and yet was also showing the emergence of distinctive groups within racessuch as Caucasians. Nonetheless, the concept of “genetic distance” did lead toone very interesting conclusion when all human groups were considered, for itmeant that “the whole of the human race was much younger and more closelyrelated than many people thought.”445[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos724346] In fact, it meantthat modern Homo sapiens sapiens has only been around for approximately the last150,000 years!446 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos724495]Here we encounter the most significant problem of them all, and Sykes zeros inon it with his customary eloquence, for what was the relationship geneticallybetween modern Homo sapiens sapiens and the earlier precursor species assembledfrom fossil records by paleontologists?> Their names — Homo habilis, Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis, Homo> neanderthalensis — reflect the to and fro of the attempts to pigeon-hole them> into different species. However, these are species defined on the basis of> anatomical features preserved in skeletons, particularly the skulls, and not> in the biological sense of different, genetically isolated, species who are> incapable of breeding with any other. It is an operational classification with> no evolutionary consequences. From the shapes of the bones alone there is> simply no way of knowing whether humans (I use the term ‘human’ to include> everything in the genus Homo) from different parts of the world were capable> of successful interbreeding. If they could interbreed, then this opens up the> possibility of their exchanging genes and spreading mutations around....> It is this question that lies behind one of the longest-running and most> deep-seated controversies in human evolution. Are the different species> defined by paleontologists — Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis and> ourselves, Homo sapiens — all part of the same gene pool or not? Or, to put it> another way, are modern humans directly descended from the fossils found in> their part of the world, or are many of these the remains of now extinct> genetically separate human species?447> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos724636] Bear in mind that point about the paleontological classification of differentspecies within the genus Homo, for it will become very important later in thischapter.These paleontological classification schemes emerged, as Sykes has indicated, bycareful comparison of fossilized remains, most of which come from Africa. Thisimportant point led paleontologists and anthropologists to propose an origin formodern man “out of Africa,” yet the presence of such remains in other parts ofthe world have led to a long-running debate. On the one hand, there are thosewho propose that modern Homo sapiens sapiens migrated out of Africa some 100,000years ago. The opposite school, on the other hand, proposed a kind of“regionalism” wherein the species evolved, more or less simultaneously andspontaneously, in different parts of the world for similar reasons.448[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos724821]But for Sykes, the fossil record, “incomplete and patchy though it is,consistently points to Africa as the ultimate origin of all humans.”449[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos724970] And if the speciespaleontologists had classified on the basis of that fossil record were in theevolutionary phylogenetic tree of modern man — that is, if modern man evolvedfrom these other species — then could genetics resolve the debates? Was there,for example, any evidence that Neanderthal man and Cro-Magnon man had anygenetic commonality, and thus possibly some deeper common origin?450[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos725120]Indeed it could.When mitochondrial DNA from Neanderthal remains were sequenced and compared tothat of approximately six thousand modern Europeans, it led to the conclusionthat modern man and Neanderthal man could not be related any later than aquarter of a million years ago. Indeed, the sequencing led to the conclusionthat not only were modern Europeans not survivors of Neanderthal man,Neanderthal was not an ancestor.451[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos725305] There was a completeabsence of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA in modern Europeans.452[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos725455]But that wasn’t the only story that mitochondrial DNA told..."},{"pageContent":"3. MITOCHONDRIAL DNA AND THE Y CHROMOSOME: MITOCHONDRIAL “EVE” AND CHROMOSOMIC“ADAM” A. MITOCHONDRIAL DNA AND THE SEVEN CLANS ...that story, the story of “mitochondrial Eve” and her seven European“daughters,” all clan mothers to all Europeans, told quite a story, but to seehow, we must know a bit more about genetics.All genes are inherited from both sets of parents, with but two exceptions: (1)mitochondrial DNA, and (2) the male Y chromosome. Within the mitochondria ofevery cell of every animal, including humans, there is a small amount of“mitochondrial DNA,” which in the case of humans comprises a mere 16,000 basepairs out of the three billion pairs in human DNA. Surprisingly, thismitochondrial DNA is also coiled in upon itself in a circle.453[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos725605] What is unique aboutmitochondrial DNA is that each human receives it only from his or her mother.The reason is that when the male sperm fertilizes an egg, the sperm’smitochondrial DNA is ejected along with its tail, and only the sperm’s nuclearDNA is paired with the mother’s DNA; the mother’s mitochondrial DNA, however,enters every mitochondrion of the new human being.454[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos725754] Thus, while both menand women possess the mitochondrial DNA of their mothers, only women pass it onto their offspring.We may pause here and note that among the ancient Egyptians and Hebrews, lineagewas always traced through the mother, a legacy, perhaps, of a scientific culturewhich preceded them.But this is only half the story. Mitochondrial DNA also mutates much morequickly than ordinary DNA, and thus, “the ‘molecular clock’ by which we cancalculate the passage of time through DNA is ticking much faster” withinmitochondrial DNA versus nuclear DNA.455[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos725938] This allowsgeneticists to calculate the approximate times or periods when significantdivergences within “clans” of mitochrondrial DNA emerged.But there’s still more...When European mitochondrial DNA was sequenced and appropriate methods of appliedmathematics were developed to determine the relative “clustering” of theseresults,456 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos726087] theresult was rather astonishing, and here, once again, the Basques enter thestory, and again upset the applecart of what had been assumed up to that point.Prior to the development of sequencing techniques and the appropriatemathematical models, it had been assumed that an agricultural explosion in theMiddle East had led to a gradual migration of people from that region intoEurope, gradually replacing the sparser huntergatherer population that had beenassumed to exist in Europe. But Sykes and his team found that only one of theseven “mitochondrial DNA clusters” that they had found fit that description.457[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos726261]Sykes and his team were not initially convinced to abandon the standard view,until they once again checked with the sequencing results of the Basques. Forthe standard view to be true, the Basques should have shown up to be a uniquegroup within the rest of Europe. But just exactly the opposite was the case. TheBasques turned out to contain representatives from six of the seven Europeanmitochondrial DNA clusters.458[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos726416] Most Europeans, inother words, came from six clan mothers “indigenous” to Europe, while theseventh group came into the picture at a later point."},{"pageContent":"B. THE Y CHROMOSOME AND THE “TEN FATHERS” There was another story that was being told by genetic sequencing as well, andthat story is locked up in the male Y chromosome. The Y chromosome has, as Sykesquips, but “one purpose in life: to create men.”459[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos726601] In effect, it is astunted gene which prevents human embryos from becoming girls.460[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos726751] It literally programsother genes in human DNA to develop into males and not females. In other words,it is a “special program.”461[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos726892]Its presence in males meant that a similar technique for tracing the paternalancestry of men could be developed as for tracing everyone’s ancestry throughmitochondrial DNA, with one very significant exception: it could only be donefor men because — with a minor exception — it was found only in men.462[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos727385] The problem with theY chromosome, however, proved to be its extraordinary stability; they were notonly “full of ‘junk’ DNA which had no obvious function,”463[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos727561] but all over theworld the amount of mutations was far below what was expected. Fortunately,however, there were “repeats” in short segments of the Y chromosome that allowedproper genetic fingerprinting of it to be done. When this was done on Europeanand Middle Eastern males, it led to the identification of ten clusters, or,“clan fathers.”464 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos727746]The bottom line is this: every European human comes from one of seven clanmothers, and every European male comes from one of ten clan fathers.But there’s more..."},{"pageContent":"4. THE SEVEN MOTHERS OF EUROPE AND THEIR CLANS The seven mitochondrial DNA clusters identified by Sykes and his team allowedthem to determine that all seven had emerged between 45,000 and 10,000 yearsago.465 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos727896] Determiningtheir probable origin and migrations, however, was more difficult. For example,a clan predominant in Scotland now, and which shows origins from approximately20,000 years ago, could not have originated in Scotland for the very simplereason that it was covered in ice 20,000 years ago.466[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos728046] Sykes and his team,on the basis of their clustering findings and a process of reasoning,essentially modified the standard model.A. URSULA’S CLAN “Ursula” was born 45,000 years ago,467[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos728196] and her clan nowconstitutes approximately 11 percent of the European population. While spreadall over Europe, there are concentrations in western Britain and Scandinavia.468[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos728381]B. XENIA’S CLAN “Xenia” was born approximately 25,000 years ago,469[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos728531] and her maternaldescendents constitute about six percent of the European population, with threebranches dispersed from Eastern Europe all the way into France and Britain.470[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos728681]C. HELENA’S CLAN “Helena’s” clan represents almost 47 percent of the European population,reaching into every corner of the continent.471[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos728831] The clan isapproximately 20,000 years old.472[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos728981]D. VELDA’S CLAN “Velda” lived approximately 16,000 years ago, most likely in northern Spain,473[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos729131] and only about fivepercent of Europeans are her descendents. Surprisingly, many of them live in thevery northern reaches of Norway and Finland.474[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos729281]E. TARA’S CLAN One of the most interesting clans is “Tara’s,” who probably lived in the hillsof Tuscany in northwestern Italy some 17,000 years ago.475[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos729431] Her clan constitutesabout nine percent of the European population, which is oddly concentrated alongthe Mediterranean, the western edges of Europe, and, of all places, Ireland.476[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos729616]F. KATRINE’S CLAN Another interesting clan is “Katrine’s,” who according to Sykes lived in thevicinity of modern Venice approximately 15,000 years ago. While only fivepercent of modern Europeans are her descendents, they remain concentrated in theMediterranean but her descendents can be found all over Europe.477[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos729766]G. JASMINE’S CLAN “Jasmine” was the last and latest clan mother, living after the end of the lastIce Age in a permanent settlement.478[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos729916] Like “Tara’s” and“Katrine’s” clans, her clan is concentrated in specific areas, having movedthrough the Iberian peninsula, ultimately ending in western Wales, Cornwall, andwestern Scotland, while another branch funnels into central Europe. Her clanconstitutes about 17 percent of the European population.479[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos730071]H. THE DEEPER ANCESTRY, THE BEGINNINGS OF A PROBLEM AND SOME BEGINNINGSPECULATIONS The seven European daughters of Eve pointed, however, to a much deeper ancestry,and it is here that we begin to encounter the themes of previous chapters,including that of ancient genetic engineering, and the problems for the standardviews that they pose. The problem arises because Sykes and his team then tookthe same methods of analysis and reapplied them to the seven European clanmothers themselves, and came to the astonishing conclusion, based onmitochondrial DNA mutations,480[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos730226] that they in turn hada common ancestor who most likely lived in the Middle East and long beforehumans settled Europe in significant numbers.481[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos730411] Sykes comments thatit is “through this woman, [that] the whole of Europe is joined to the rest ofthe world.”482 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos731101]Tracing mitochondrial DNA sequences even further back, geneticists have beenable to determine that there are 33 clans present in the world, an odd number,since, of course, it corresponds to the 33 degrees of Scottish rite Masonry. Andof these, 13 clans are from Africa.483[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos731251] While the oddcorrespondence between the number of genetic clans and Masonry’s “sacred number”of 33 may be and probably is coincidental, the occurrence of 13 African clans isintriguing, and we shall return to it presently.Ultimately, of course, geneticists have traced all human origins to a commonmother, “mitochondrial Eve,” who lived in Africa some 150,000 years ago.484[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos731401] While some may leapon this fact as yet another “scientific confirmation of the Bible,” it really isnot, for all that such genetic evidence indicates is that of all possibleultimate clans, only “Eve’s” survived. There may have been other such ultimateclan mothers but their stock died out for whatever reason.485[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos731556] Mitochondrial Eve’sdescendents spread from Africa up through the Middle East, and thence tocolonize the rest of the world.486[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos731697]A comparison of these results with the O’Briens’ examination of the indicationsof genetic engineering in the Kharsag tablets is illuminating, and highlights anumber of problems, for on the one hand, the results of modern genetics appearto diametrically contradict the O’Briens’ analysis, but on the other, there areminor indications that confirm it.There are strong arguments against the O’Briens’ analysis presented by moderngenetics, and these may be boiled down to essentially two points:> 1. The age of modern mankind indicated by genetics is approximately 150,000> years old, yet the Kharsag tablets were written much later, and the impression> given by the O’Briens’ analysis is that the genetic engineering subtly> indicated in them does not occur at that period of time. In short, the timing> is wrong; and,> 2. The location of the engineering, as the O’Briens understood it, was in the> Middle East near modern-day Lebanon, whereas the genetics indicates an origin> from Africa. In short, the location indicated in the tablets is wrong.This augurs poorly for a correspondence between modern science and ancienttexts.But there are very slight and minor indications of some correspondence betweenthese genetic findings and the Kharsag Tablets as the O’Briens interpreted them,and oddly enough, these lie in the numbers recorded in both:> 1. In the Kharsag Tablets, the original number of human “clan mothers” was> 14,487 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos732119] whereas> genetic science indicates the number of primordial African clans to be 13, a> close agreement and one suggestive perhaps of some deep correspondence between> the two data points in high antiquity;> 2. The number of European “clan mothers” — seven — is a numerical component of> the number 14, again, a very slight indicator that perhaps there is some> deeply rooted historical and scientific basis for the claims the O’Briens make> concerning the Kharsag Tablets.While such “evidence” does not permit us to draw conclusions one way or anotherabout the possible correspondences between modern genetics and these ancienttexts, they do highlight the nature of the problems of synthesizing the two thatnow confront us, and suggest some speculative solutions. But a synthetic andspeculative resolution of this problem will require a closer look at the widerscientific context from which to view the problem, to which we now turn."},{"pageContent":"B.

If this soundsvaguely familiar, it should, for not only does it square in its broad outlineswith the Native American Indian traditions of different ages typified bydifferent humanities that were surveyed in the previous chapter, but moreimportantly, it will be recalled that among the Aztecs there were exactly foursuch previous ages, giving a total of five “humanities” if one counts thecurrent age and modern Homo sapiens sapiens.496[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos733797] The case that theNative Americans inherited their legends from much higher antiquity has thusgrown a bit stronger, for such observations imply by their very nature a moresophisticated pitch of civilization and scientific observation able to make suchobservations.It is now time to throw the final monkey wrench into the works: the research ofVedic scholars Michael A. Cremo and Richard L. Thompson..."},{"pageContent":"2. THE CREMO-THOMPSON ARCHAEOLOGICAL ANOMALIES AND GENETIC ANTIQUITY PROBLEMS As noted, Cremo and Thompson are scholars of the Vedic literature of ancientIndia. But why would they become involved in a study of the scientific originsof man in conjunction with Vedic literature? Cremo’s answer puts it “countrysimple”:> Some might question why we would put together a book like The Hidden History> of the Human Race, unless we had some underlying purpose. Indeed, there is> some underlying purpose.> Richard Thompson and I are members of the Bhaktivedanta Institute, a branch of> the International Society for Krishna Consciousness that studies the> relationship between modern science and the worldview expressed in the Vedic> literature of India.

Theory selection can come from many sources — a private> inspiration, previous theories, a suggestion from a friend, a movie, and so> on. What really matters is not a theory’s source but its ability to account> for observations.497> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos734003] We share Cremo’s and Thompson’s convictions about the antiquity of humans — ofwhatever species — but adopt here as our methodology an even wider context inancient texts, in what they indicate concerning human origins, where thoseorigins come from, and, to a limited extent, the motivations recorded in thosetexts for the engineered creation of humans. We do so in order to propose aspeculative resolution of the models of modern science on the one hand, and ofthe texts on the other.Just how radical is Cremo’s and Thompson’s approach to this question may bereadily appreciated by a brief survey of anomalous archaeological evidence thathas been conveniently “forgotten” by modern science in its rush to avoid theimplications that this evidence suggests. This evidence is presented in chaptersix of their book The Hidden History of the Human Race, a chapter entitled,aptly enough, “Evidence for Advanced Culture in Distant Ages.”498[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos734300] Here we survey asmall but significant sampling of the data they have collected.Dating by stratigraphy is a common method of dating the approximate age of anobject embedded in certain geological layers of the earth... that is, unless theobject and the stratum in which it is embedded is “inconvenient” to the standardmodel. One such object was reported in 1844 by Sir David Brewster, who statedthat “a nail had been discovered firmly embedded in a block of sandstone fromthe Kingoodie (MyInfield) Quarry in Scotland.”499[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos734455] A nail embedded insandstone would hardly be inconvenient, except in this instance the sandstoneinto which it was embedded happened to be from the Devonian period, making thedate — if the find was genuine — between 360 and 408 million years old, farolder than any evolutionary models for the origins of even the genus of“humanids,” as shown above!This wasn’t all.Cremo and Thompson note that on June 22, 1844, a story ran in the London Timesthat a gold thread (!) had been found embedded in a stone at a depth of eightfeet. Once again, the stratigraphic context proved to be inconvenient, for thestone into which it was embedded was from the Early Carboniferous age, that is,“between 320 and 360 million years old.”500[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos734605]There was more bad news...On June 5, 1852, an article innocently and innocuously entitled “A Relic of aBygone Age” appeared in Scientific American. Cremo and Thompson cite therelevant portion of the article for our purpose:> “A few days ago a powerful blast was made in the rock at Meeting House Hill,> in Dorchester, a few rods south of Rev. Mr. Hall’s meeting house. The blast> threw out an immense mass of rock, some of the pieces weighing several tons,> and scattered fragments in all directions.

The matter is worthy of investigation, as there is no deception in the> case.501 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos734813] As Cremo and Thompson note, the pudding stone of the area in which the vesselwas blasted loose from the rock, dates from the Precambrian period; that is, thestratigraphic dating of the object would make it over 600 million years old!Cremo and Thompson’s concluding words about this discovery say it all:> By standard accounts, life was just beginning to form on this planet during> the Precambrian [period]. But in the Dorchester vessel we have evidence> indicating the presence of artistic metal workers in North America over 600> million years before Leif Ericson.502> [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos735026] And of course, metalworking art implies intelligence and technology tomanufacture it.It gets decidedly worse. A chalk ball was discovered in 1862 in strata 45–55million years old near Laon, France, and reported in the April 1862 edition ofThe Geologist.503 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos735176]A coin, with curious and indecipherable inscriptions, was discovered in Illinoisin strata that would date it between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago (there’s thatdate again!).504 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos735317] Thefinding was reported in 1871 by William E. Dubois of the SmithsonianInstitution. What makes this particular coin so significant is what Dubois saidabout it, for noting its uniform thickness, Dubois concluded that it must have“passed through a rolling-mill; and if the ancient Indians had such acontrivance, it must have been pre-historic.”505[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos735467] For Cremo andThompson, the evidence again suggests “the existence of a civilization at least200,000 years ago in North America.”506[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos735617] And that, precisely,was the problem, for “beings intelligent enough to make and use coins (Homosapiens sapiens)” were not around, according to the geneticists, until only150,000 years ago!507 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos735758]There are clay figurines found at Nampa, Idaho in strata two million yearsold;508 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos735966] a gold chainembedded in Carboniferous coal discovered in Illinois in coal dating from260–320 million years old;509[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos736121] an iron cup found inOklahoma coal approximately 312 million years old;510[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos736271] a metallic machinedrectangular tube, in other words, a machined object, discovered in France inlayers of chalk 65 million years old;511[Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos736426] and on and on thelist could go.One of the most interesting and most anomalous pieces of evidence recorded inCremo’s and Thompson’s inventory of “inconvenient artifacts” is an obviouslymachined, small metallic sphere with three parallel grooves around its equator,found in strata from the Precambrian period in South Africa, said to be almostthree billion years old, almost three quarters of the age of the Earthitself!512 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos736576]All of this throws a rather thorny problem into the mix, for if, on the onehand, modern man and his ancestors are at best only 2.4 million years old, thenwho was here doing all of this?

But for now, the question is, if Homo sapiens sapiens is only150,000 years old, and if it is generally agreed that he did not begin to usecoins until only much later, then, once again, who was here, and what were theydoing?"},{"pageContent":"3. THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE COSMIC WAR AND THE ANCIENT TEXTS If there are “inconvenient artifacts” tens, even hundreds, of millions of yearsold, or in one instance, billions of years old, and if these show evidence ofmachining and therefore of technology, then one answer immediately presentsitself from the ancient texts: there were “others” here, our genetic cousinsperhaps, who were clearly civilized, possessed of a technology, and perhapsevery now and then, directly intervening in the course of human development andevolution.And if this be the case, as Cremo’s and Thompson’s evidence clearly suggests,then we have found the probable and ultimate origin and reason for why NativeAmerican “myths” of various ages of creatures and different “humanities” was sobroadly accurate, for they did ultimately stem from an advanced culture in “highantiquity” that actually observed the “monsters” and wars described in theirlegends.Let us look closer at the chronological problem now posed by four entirelydifferent data sets:> 1. the data set of modern genetics indicating the probable origin of modern> man, Homo sapiens sapiens, approximately 150,000 years ago “out of Africa”;> 2. the data presented by certain ancient texts as to the significant date of> approximately 200,000 years ago;> 3. the data presented by geological and astronomical evidence that I recounted> in The Cosmic War; and finally,> 4. the anomalous and “inconvenient artifacts” presented by Cremo and Thompson.Is there a way to harmonize and synthesize these very different models of humanhistory? And if so, what agenda or agendas might that harmonization suggest wasoperative at different points of history and in different regions and cultures?In my previous book The Cosmic War, I stated the following about thechronological problem, and the above list of disparate data sets:> In order to tie together all the disparate pieces that I believe may form> components of this gigantic scenario of cosmic war and catastrophe, of giants> and chimeras, of “gods” and men and Nephilim, it is essential to paint in very> broad strokes. While I do entertain discussion of broad chronological and> other scientific and archaeological considerations, I do not enter into> lengthy examinations of disciplines related to and affected by the Cosmic War> hypothesis, such as evolutionary biology, anthropology, or even theology,> philosophy, comparative religion, and esoteric or occult history. That such> fields are affected by this hypothesis should be obvious. But to discuss each> of these implications in detail would not only require several lengthy tomes> in their own right, it would also distract attention from the main themes of> the scenario...> Similarly, I do not attempt to reconstruct a whole detailed chronology of an> alternative “pre-history” of extraterrestrial contact, intervention, wars, and> so on... for a very simple reason.

Points 6–8 above suggest that further genetic projects might have taken place.We have already pointed out the odd, though minor, corroboration of moderngenetic findings with its 13 primordial African clans, and the Kharsag Tablets’14 human donor mothers, and seven European clan mothers, to the geneticengineering project.Oddly enough, as has been seen in the previous chapter, Native Americantraditions contain the idea of different ages populated by different“humanities,” and in particular, as was also seen, the Aztec tradition recordedfive different humanities, including the present one, each of which wereengineered by “the gods.” An ocean and hemisphere away, the Mesopotamian textssay essentially the same thing.There is a further indicator that we might be looking at something of thisnature, and that is the Sumerian tradition that “kingship” was “lowered fromabove” or from heaven, that it came from “the gods.” When compared to theKharsag Tablets it will be recalled that the “divine” part of modern came from“the gods” or, to be more accurate, one specific male donor, whereas the “human”component came from 14 donor mothers.This odd combination might in fact reflect a dim mythological memory of twoscientific facts we encountered in the previous chapter, namely that one canonly trace human ancestry through the mother and mitochondrial DNA, whereas, ifthere were to be any traceable presence of DNA unrelated to humanity and comingfrom some other species of the genus Homo, then the most likely place to traceor discover it would be via the male Y chromosome which is found only in humanmales.529 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_112.html#filepos740763] It is infact within the male Y chromosome that there is a great deal of the so-called“junk” or non-coding DNA.We recall also the fact of the more-than-coincidental resemblance of the ChineseI Ching system of divination to the nature of human DNA itself, a fact thatstrongly suggests that someone in ancient times knew a great deal not only abouthuman DNA, but about its possible connection to a deeper physics. This suggeststhat while some texts and myths might have been garbled, preserving only fainttraces of a lost plateau of scientific development, other traditions existedthat preserved whole portions of that science intact — albeit encoded — and thatin turn suggests the presence of an elite doing the preserving.All of these things taken together suggest one other significant thing: an elitethat may in fact be only partially human, and descended more directly from thatputative genetic engineering of humanity, or perhaps even from the original“gods” themselves, an elite that perhaps has survived down to our own day,walking amongst us, undetected, “like aliens.”And this brings up the final point in our chronological table, and a finalagenda:> 9) At a much later point, some myths and texts arise whose function appears to> be precisely to obscure the above scenario, and the elites behind the> activities that comprise it. There is, so to speak, a counter-revolution> underway by an elite opposing all these agendas and seeking to usurp power for> itself. Its standard technique of obscurantism appears to be the> “religification” of these ideas and a demand for unquestioning obedience to> this or that dogma of this or that “god” and a willingness to murder under the> justification of “obedience” to him. As indicated in the Preface, I am acutely aware of the radical nature that thisimplication of the data surveyed here has for conventional religiousapologetics, and for the history and possible editing of religious texts to suitan agenda. At the minimum, however, it is a growing problem, and seriousscholars of texts and informed theologians, philosophers, anthropologists andscientists from every discipline will inevitably have to deal with it — and moresuccessfully than the manner in which the past two millennia have dealt with it.The time of idle and fruitless contemporary debates between the dialecticaloppositions of the god of “intelligent design” versus the atheistic god of“evolutionary chance” are over, for if the synthetic view be true, then thetruth lies somewhere between those polarities. The data from space, the datafrom texts, the moral and ethical dilemmas they pose, and the data from mankindand Earth herself, combine on this synthetic view into a scenario of vast andcosmic proportions, and the fate of humanity itself is at stake.It is high time we get on with it, and to the work that this survey has merelyscratched the surface of, for if any truths emerge from this survey they arethese: (1) there is more truth than myth to ancient legends and texts, ifexamined a certain way, and (2) it is time for humanity to grow up, for afterall, we are all, in the very real biological sense, cousins, and maybe, justmaybe, we have other “cousins” out there somewhere still.The bad news is, they may be coming back..."},{"pageContent":"045 [images/00045.jpg]BIBLIOGRAPHY Barton, George Aaron.

Knight and Butler also speculate on the existence of a MegalithicRod that is 6 Megalithic Yards in length, or 5 modern meters in length. Thisgives a unit of linear measure that relates the imperial and metric systemsdirectly, since a modern statutory mile would then be equal to 320 “MegalithicRods” in length, while a modern metric kilometer would equal 200 Megalithic Rodsin length.

Hoagland, “A Moon with a View,” www.enterprisemission.com[http://www.enterprisemission.com]. Hoagland observes, rightly, that such astark and striking resemblance challenges the notions of coincidence andsynchronicity, as it raises the prospect of a “controlled release” ofinformation, and raising the question of “how did Lucas know, when did he knowit, and who told him?” Of course, such ideas may easily have been out of thecontrol of Lucas himself, and may have come from someone in his productionstaff. But the larger issues remain: who knew, and how did they know long beforeCassini took its breathtaking pictures? One answer, of course, is that the“moon” was secretly photographed long before Cassini journeyed to Saturn, whichraises the prospect of a secret space program, a hypothesis that Hoagland hasbeen advocating strongly for years.108 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_031.html#filepos167961]Richard C.

One possible reason for itsinterest was disclosed by Richard C. Hoagland and Mike Bara in their New YorkTimes bestselling book, Dark Mission: The Secret History of NASA, for if theApollo astronauts found and saw evidence of ancient civilization and technologyduring the Apollo Moon landings, or even brought some of it back to Earth withthem, then this would be a closely guarded secret, and the astronauts’ selectivememories of what they saw would have been “wiped.” Hoagland and Bara commentthat the use of such mind manipulation technologies may account for the peculiarinability of the Apollo astronauts to remember in any details what they actuallysaw on the Moon.

Biblical authorssimply altered names and changed the many ‘gods’ of the original writings intothe one ‘God’ or ‘Lord’ of the Hebrew religion. The latter change was anunfortunate one because it caused a Supreme Being to be blamed for the brutalacts that earlier writers had attributed to the very un-God-like Custodians.”(William Bramley, The Gods of Eden [Avon Books, 1990], p. 46). Of course, thatmay have been the point of the change, to claim to be the Supreme Deityprecisely in order to exact unquestioning obedience, and thereby to justifyimmoral acts with the cloak of “morality” obtained by “obedience” to someonewho, in the end, was an imposter.220 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_062.html#filepos312850]Paracelsus, The Aurora of the Philosophers, from Paracelsus, his Aurora &Treasure of the Philosophers, As also the Water-Stone of the Wise Men;Describing the matter of, and manner how to attain the universal Tincture,Faithfully Englished, and Published by J.H.

Celera was caught in its own Catch-22 as well, for its databasewas made available to drug companies and private bio-research companies for asubscription fee, yet the Human Genome Project, by making its data publiclyavailable for free undercut Celera’s potential customer base.

As of this writing, however, this author can find no directconceptual or textual link between the ancient texts and the mediaeval doctrine,other than, of course, the texts of the Old Testament law itself. To argue sucha case would require a massive reinterpretation of the evolution of the text ofthe Torah itself, and a presupposition that massive editing is in evidence forthe purpose of obscuring external references to Mesopotamian cultures and theirinfluence upon it. Such a task is well outside the scope of this book.321 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_077.html#filepos413833]John C. King and Dennis R.

It should be noted thatwithin the system of the I Ching, the system begins with a kind of “primordialmaleness” or “yang” (q.v. p. 46), representing heaven. Given this primordialmasculine unity, the I Ching itself, in yet another parallel with modernscientific views, represents a system based on a broken symmetry in the physicalmedium (q.v. p. 45), from which a base dipole — yang and yin, a subsequentdivision of the feminine part of the masculine — emerges.326 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_078.html#filepos421112]Schönberg remarks, “Is it not possible that in the DNA code — ascript withsignificance, meaning, expression, information, impulse and life — we can seeand recognize firsthand both spiritual and material structures erupting into thehyle, the material?” (Dr. Martin Schönberger, The I Ching and the Genetic Code:the Hidden Key to Life [Santa Fe, New Mexico: Aurora Press, 1992], p. 43.) Onthis view, the human person is, as it were, transduced into material existencefrom the physical medium, making the person itself a non-local phenomenon.

Other Native American traditions fromMeso- and South America also explicitly state that their cultures are legacycultures and the product of some “civilizer god” from whom they derived theirscientific and cosmological sophistication (see my The Cosmic War, pp. 279–285).426 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_098.html#filepos539792]Michael A.

The Middle Eastern origin of European populations raises its ownspecial issues for alternative researchers, since the legends indicating apossible genetically engineered origin of humanity stem, in part, from there,and it is these legends that contain the greatest amount of detail suggestive ofsuch engineering. The problem is complicated and confounded by indications ofconnections between ancient Sumer and the Indo-Aryan cultures of India... butthat relationship is, perhaps, the subject of another book and investigation.482 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_104.html#filepos568433]Ibid., p. 274.483 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_104.html#filepos568823]Ibid., p. 276.484 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_104.html#filepos569308]Ibid., pp. 276–277.485 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_104.html#filepos569686]Ibid.486 [Genes_Giants-nsters_and_Men_split_104.html#filepos569869]Sykes, The Seven Daughters of Eve, pp. 277–278.
