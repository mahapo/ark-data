We didnot begin with barter, discover money, and then eventually develop creditsystems. It happened precisely the other way around. What we now call virtualmoney came first. Coins came much later, and their use spread only unevenly,never completely replacing credit systems. Barter, in turn, appears to belargely a kind of accidental byproduct of the use of coinage or paper money … ”—David Graeber2THERE ARE TIMES when I wish that I had been born in seventeenth century Berlinor London, or that I could transplant their literary style and diction to thetwenty-first century, so that I could indulge my taste for explanatory titles ofbooks, those long titles that are part title, part sub-title, part academicabstract, and part table of contents, such that one could, in many cases, readthe title without having to read the book. In that case, the title of this bookwould be:Babylon’s Banksters, the Financial Vipers of Venice, the Annuitary Asps ofAmsterdam, the Collateralized Cobras of the City of London, and the Weasels ofWall Street: In One Stupendous Volume,BEINGAn Objective, Dispassionate and Encyclopedic Discourse and Assaying Essay Uponthe Marvelous Magick of the Metaphor of the Medium, Money, Alchemy, Metaphysicksand the Darke Secrets, Mysteries and Miserific Witchery of Banking, BullionBrokers, and Corporate Personhood&Upon the High Crimes and Misdemeanors of Banksters From The Bardi, Perruzi,Cerchi, Fuggers, Contarini, Dandoli, Mocenigi, D’Estes, Welfs, Orange-Nassaus,Saxe-Coburg und Gothas, Medicis, and Borgias, Contarini, Mocenigos, and otherAssorted Miscreants Downe to Our Own Time&Upon the Excesses and BabelishCONSPIRACIES,CABALS,CONGRESSES,CONVENTIONS&CONVENTICLESof the Rottenchilds, Rockefailures, Wartburgs, Schiffen, Kohns, Luhbs, Leymanns,and LeesWith Modeste Proposals for TheirSOLUTION.Heady and HarrowsgateGeoffrey Codswallop & Sons, Ltd. LondonMMXIIAll of this would, of course, be encased in the florid filigree of a baroquecartouche, with fat cherubs seraphically strumming lutes and lyres, with a sceneof Christ chasing the money-changers from the Temple, while berobed onlookers,clutching their frocks anxiously around them, warily eyed the whole proceeding.Well, unfortunately (or perhaps, fortunately), times and literary tastes havechanged, and publishers like quick alliterative sound bites for titles, with thecontents of the book being in the actual book and not the title, and they preferbreaking up such essays into one or more volumes, rather than publishingponderous one-volume tomes.Thus, all humor aside, this book is conceived as the second in a series I hadplanned beginning with Babylon’s Banksters: The Alchemy of Deep Physics, HighFinance, and Ancient Religion. But the title of it—The Financial Vipers ofVenice: Alchemical Money, Magical Physics, and Banking in the Middle Ages andRenaissance—is somewhat misleading, for this book is about more than Venice, orfor that matter, the Middle Ages or Renaissance. It is as much about our own“feudal” age as a former one, and as much about ancient times as about medievalones.I begin with Venice, and its persecution of the famous Renaissance magusGiordano Bruno. I intend both Venice and Bruno’s martyrdom to function as thetwin icons of a system, and of the tremendous change in cultural debate thatoccurred because of what both the Venetian system, and the magus, represented.Like its predecessor volume, therefore, this is an extended essay on therelationship between metaphysics, physics, alchemical magic, and finance, and,as we shall also discover, apocalyptic speculation.Why apocalyptic speculation?For a very simple reason.We tend to take many of our social conventions, including our institutions offinance and credit, for granted, assuming their implicit permanence withoutrealizing that they arose from a certain complex constellation of culturalfactors—from medieval metaphysical and philosophical speculations and doctrineson the nature of debt and personhood, from alchemical metaphors of thetransmutative physical medium, from varying notions of what actually constitutesmoney, credit, and debt—that were hardly permanent. From the High Middle Agesca. 1400 to the establishment of the Bank of England in 1694, the meaning of“money” fluctuated back and forth from virtual credit and local private“currencies,” to securities, to bullion, and back again, in just three hundredyears.We likewise tend to wonder—with some justification—how an excursion into suchmagical medieval matters could possibly shed light on the contemporary debate onfinance, commerce, credit and debt taking place around the world. Some mightargue that there is no resemblance between the Middle Age and Renaissanceeconomies and institutions and our own. After all, ours is a truly globaleconomy. With our modern lights, the Middle Ages and Renaissance seem not onlyhalf a world away, but hopelessly arcane and irrelevant to our own time.As will be seen in these pages, however, the modern global economy, with itsbonds, annuities, bills of exchange, alchemical paper “fiat money,” bullion,wage-slavery, national debts, private central banking, stock brokerages andcommodities exchanges, in a sense began in the Middle Ages, for quiteperceptible and specific reasons. The debates we are having now over corporateresponsibility to the public good, and over the proper role and influence ofprivate corporations within public government, all occurred in the Middle Agesand Renaissance as well.The Daddy Warbucks, Little Orphan Annies, the rags-to-riches heroes ofnineteenth century American pulp fiction, the corporate heroes—the Carnegies,Fords, Rockefellers—of yesteryear were once lauded, and now, as circumstanceshave changed, are excoriated. The same, as we shall see, is an old debate, andcorporations—corporate persons, the persona ficta of medieval jurisprudence—atvarying times and for varying reasons, were held now as responsible for risks,and now as insulated from them, now as responsible for and to the public good(and hence punishable, even by death, for infractions of it), and now as not.The centerpiece in this debate, then as now, was, of course, money: What, andwho, does it really represent? And how did it manage to begin as a purelymetaphysical phenomenon, with deep ties to a cosmological and indeed topologicaland alchemical metaphor of the physical medium, then to transmute itself intothe conception that money is bullion, and then once again to transmute itselfback into a purely metaphysical construct of credit and debt denominated ontokens of paper? To phrase the questions in this fashion is once again to pointout what I argued in Babylon’s Banksters, namely, that there is a deep andabiding relationship between a culture’s view of physics and cosmology and itsviews of finance and credit. Nowhere is this complex relationship rendered moreclearly than in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.The centerpiece here is, of course, Venice, and the rather “conspiracy theory”view taken of its activities. On the internet there are a variety of articlespurporting to show that Venice’s dark and hidden hand lay behind the demise ofthe great Florentine international “super-companies,” the Bardi and Peruzzicompanies, and in some cases, this scenario is extended to even broader theoriesof deliberate Venetian involvement in the importation of the Black Plague, andso on. For myself, the central and most interesting part of these internettheories has always been the demise of the great Florentine super-companies, andthat will eventually be our focus here. These articles, while often referring toscholarly academic works that can—and as will be seen here, do—make the case forsuch a role for the Venetian financial oligarchy, seldom cite those studies withanything approaching academic rigor, a problem that so often surfaces in thealternative media and research community. And the citation of such academicsources, even if only in general terms, often disguises a methodologicalproblem, namely, that the argument for such a conspiratorial view must be madeby combining such sources, taking note not only of Venetian banking and exchangepractices, but also taking note of the structure of its government agencies andits noble families and financial classes. Academic histories of Venetianmonetary policy tend to ignore such features, or, if they approach it at all,only suggest it briefly, thence to quickly shuffle on—“nothing to see herefolks, move along”—while political histories of the Venetian shenanigans abound,but they tend to be decoupled from the underlying trading and monetary aspects.The attempt of this book is to fill in that void, albeit in a necessarilycursory and synoptic fashion.This work is consequently only an essay, an argued speculation, or perhapsbetter put, a meditation, on this complex constellation of concepts, for asanyone who has researched any of these individual components is aware, a vastand specialized literature exists for each of them. I have attempted, therefore,to restrict myself to citations from sources more readily available, though in acouple of instances, specialized—and quite expensive—references wereunavoidable.(As an aside here, so expensive were two of these sources that my utilization ofthem would not have been possible without the generous support of my readers,some of whom donated the funds to purchase them. While trying to find them—oneof which I had been seeking for some years until I finally found a rare bookdealer with a copy for sale at the “reasonable” price of $325!—I had, and stillhave, the impression that these books, essential sources for any monetary andfinancial history of the high Middle Ages and Renaissance in Italy, weredeliberately bought up, leaving few circulating copies on the market. Thereasons for my suspicion will, I suspect, become abundantly clear to the readerin the main text of this book. In a word, techniques are clearly shown, and in afew [very few] instances, names are named that provide connections to modernhistory and what the old news commentator Paul Harvey called “the rest of thestory … ”)In any case, the complexity both of the concepts and of their interrelationshipscan be revealed by considering just one of the components, a strange, wonderful,and mysterious fact: we humans tend to couch our language of love in terms ofthe language of debt, of a transaction, and even of sacrifice. We say, forexample, that we are indebted to a loved one. “I am forever in your debt,” wesay to a lover, a friend, a brother, a sister, a parent. Parents speak of“owing” their children a decent life, love, a happy home. Children speak of“owing” their parents respect, honor, love. In short, the language of debt, offinance, transaction, contract, and commerce, are a part of our vocabulary oflove, even of our religion and culture. Christ, for example, is called theRedeemer, yet another term of transaction. The Pater Noster, in one well-knownEnglish translation, has the petitioner saying “Forgive us our debts, as weforgive our debtors,” even though the idea of a general debt forgiveness in thesociety at large praying this prayer was quite unthinkable. The question is,why? And when did this association of love, transaction, credit, debt, andreligion first begin?Here, the execution of Giordano Bruno by Roman authorities becomes an iconicportal, a gateway into the profound mysteries of alchemical money, magicalphysics, and banking. For here we find a clash of worldviews on religion,physics, and finance, combined with different interpretations of an ancientmetaphor, a metaphor for whose implications Bruno was both murdered … andmartyred …  Joseph P.

When this was done, the man was most likely brushedwith tars and oils according to the practice of the period, and flame was put tothe bundles of wood. The flames and smoke rose, boiling and baking the skin,perhaps amid cries of anguish and suffering, until, overcome with pain, hefinally lapsed into unconsciousness and death.This burnt offering of a man had made his way to France, thence to Geneva, backto Paris, onward to London and Oxford, back to Paris, to Germany and Bohemia,and finally back to his native Italy. Along all these travels, he had managed toanger the Anglican doctors and dons of Oxford, the Puritans of Cambridge, theCalvinists of Geneva, and of course, the Lutherans of Germany and the Catholicsof France and his homeland.After the burning was complete, the red- and purple-robed authorities breathed asigh of relief. The ideological threat the man posed had brought them perilouslyclose to losing not just power, but centuries of status and standing. They were,however, but agents for deeper, murkier powers, powers whose long-term plans andgoals were very directly threatened by the man and his ideas.Those powers were Venice and the Vatican.And the man’s name was Giordano Bruno.Bruno was a martyr to a Metaphor, to a way of thinking and viewing the cosmosthat he—most definitely not alone—had come to hold and to champion. Hismartyrdom to that metaphor is an icon of a tremendous clash of forces that wastransforming his world and time, forces deeply embedded in religion, alchemy,money, magic, and even, as we shall see, physics.However, to understand how Bruno came to such a tragic fate, and why thisbrilliant man could symbolize such a constellation of forces, we must first lookdeeper into his life, and into the powers that conspired to end it. We must lookinto the Hermetic Metaphor by which he lived and for which he died, and into thetremendous threat it posed to the financial power of Venice and the religiouspower of the Vatican (and for that matter, to the Protestant world as well).Accordingly, in this chapter we will explore Bruno’s life and doctrine, in thenext chapter we will explore the Hermetic Metaphor itself and its relation toBruno’s doctrine, and in the third and fourth chapters we will explore Venice’sfinancial doctrine and power. These three chapters in turn will afford theportal of entry into a deeper exploration of medieval jurisprudence, philosophy,physics, and finance in the subsequent sections of this book.A. BRUNO’S LIFE AND WANDERINGS [Contents.html#rsec1]Though the exact date of his birth is unknown, it is known that Giordano FilippoBruno was born in the year 1548 in Nola, within the then-Kingdom of Naples.Throughout his life, he and others thus referred to himself as “the Nolan.” Hereceived what was then a traditional education, and entered the Dominican orderat the Naples monastery of San Domenico Maggiore at the age of seventeen, takingfor his ecclesiastical and monastic name “Giordano, after Giordano Crispo, hismetaphysics tutor.”2He was ordained a priest in 1572, and early in his life showed a remarkableability with memory, even journeying to Rome to demonstrate his memory system toPope Pius V. However, it was also during this period that his tendency to think“outside” the box of ecclesiastical doctrine and dogma took hold, manifest inhis reading of banned works of the North European humanist Erasmus, in hisrejection of images of the saints, and in his defense of the Arian doctrine,that is to say, the doctrine that Christ was a mere man and not the secondperson of the Trinity. Learning that an indictment was being prepared againsthim by the local Inquisition, Bruno laid aside his monastic frock and fledNaples for the city-states of northern Italy, including Venice and Padua. AtPadua, he encountered fellow Dominicans who encouraged him to wear the Dominicanhabit once again.From there, Bruno wandered across the Alps into France and eventually ended upin John Calvin’s (1509–1564) Protestant Geneva in 1579, where he adopted seculardress in order to move freely within the city. However, Bruno, never one to holdhis tongue or pen, soon ran afoul of the Calvinist authorities, and fled Genevafor France once again, finally taking his doctorate at Toulouse, and attemptingyet again, unsuccessfully, to return to the Church. When strife broke out inToulouse, Bruno made his way to Paris, where his feats of memory brought him tothe attention of King Henry III. It was here that Bruno published his first workon the art of memory, De Umbris Idearum, “The Shadows of Ideas” (1582). As wewill discover in the next section, Bruno’s art of memory is deeply tied to hisviews on magic and the cosmological Metaphor for which he gave his life.In the year 1583 Bruno journeyed to England as a guest and under the protectionof the French ambassador Michel de Castelnau, and it is here that Bruno enteredinto the first public controversies with the authorities that would eventuallybring about his trial and execution. He did so by delivering a series ofcontroversial lectures at the University of Oxford, in which he defendedNicholas Copernicus’ then-controversial theory that the Earth revolved aroundthe sun, with George Abbot, later the Archbishop of Canterbury, taking theopposing view. It was during this period in England that Bruno wrote many of hismost famous, and as we shall see, scandalous works, among them Lo Spaccio dellaBestia Trionfante (The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast), a work that Karen DeLeón-Jones has described as being part of a trilogy on “the ethics ofmutation,”3 and On Cause, Principle, and Unity, two works we shall examine inmore detail in the next section. It is even speculated that while Bruno wasstaying in London under the French ambassador’s protection, he was also spyingon Catholics for Sir Francis Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth’s famous Secretary ofState and spymaster.Bruno returned to France in 1585, but found a reception less warm than before,since his relentless attacks on the cosmology and physics of Aristotle—thereigning cosmology and physics of the Roman Catholic Church—plus his openendorsement of the Copernican theory had earned him the ire of Catholicauthorities. Thus, by 1586 he had departed for Germany, where he was able toland a teaching position at the University of Wittenberg. Here he remained fortwo years, until once again, changing academic climates forced him to flee toPrague, and then to flee yet again after being excommunicated by the Lutheransthere for his controversial views. It was, however, during this period that hecomposed and published several works in Latin (among them On Magic) which, as weshall discover in the next section, were guaranteed to upset both Catholic andProtestant orthodoxy, on account of the very tight blending of magicalphilosophy with the broader Hermetic cosmology he had come to adopt as hispersonal religion. Bruno promoted this new Hermetic religion because he believedit could unify the growing religious divisions within Europe.1. The Return to Venice, and a Mystery [Contents.html#rsec2]By 1591 Bruno had landed in Frankfurt, and his life took the turn that wouldeventually lead him to the stake, for it was here that he received theinvitation from the Venetian nobleman Giovanni Mocenigo to come to Venice andinstruct him on the secrets of his art of memory. Mocenigo had acquired a copyof Bruno’s De Minimo and was so impressed with its references to the art ofmemory that he wrote to Bruno asking him to come to Venice, where he would payhim to tutor him in the art.4It’s here that we begin to sense the discomforting possibilities of a mysteryand of a conspiracy. Arthur D. Imerti, whose superb translation of The Expulsionof the Triumphant Beast we shall rely on in this section, puts it this way: It is difficult to understand why the philosopher decided toreturn to Italy, whence he was a fugitive from both the Neapolitan and RomanInquisitions. Perhaps the author of (The Expulsion) believed that his hereticalphilosophical and religious ideas might meet, if not with acceptance, at leastwith toleration in the Republic of Venice … 5But the mystery only deepens when one considers the views on wealth and propertyBruno himself stated in the second dialogue of The Expulsion. There, Brunoadvocates that “tyrants be deposed” and “republics be favored,” certainly nothreat to the Serenissima Republica of Venice. But then, without so much as apause for breath, Bruno urges that “the indolent, the avaricious, and the ownersof property be scorned and held in contempt.”6Imerti observes that these words “might be construed as socialistic”7 and such adirect assault on property and wealth could hardly be palatable to the views ofthe Venetian republic, founded as it was on an empire of merchant banking andmercenary military force. One is dealing with the possibility, therefore, thatBruno was simply tricked into returning to Venice. (And there are otherpossibilities, as will be seen in section two.)This possibility grows when one considers Mocenigo’s actions toward Bruno.Initially, he showered Bruno with “numerous acts of kindness” to the extent thatBruno was apparently taken in by Mocenigo, eventually divulging “many of hisheretical ontological and epistemological views,”8 the very cosmological viewsthat were the basis both of his art of memory and its corresponding philosophyof magic. The Venetian nobleman, however, quickly became disenchanted with theprogress of his studies with the Nolan, and “accused Bruno of not teaching himall he knew about the arts of memory, invention, and geometry, threateningrepeatedly to denounce him to the Holy Office if he did not teach him what hehad promised.”9 The Venetian disclosed Bruno’s views to his father confessor,who urged him to denounce the Nolan to the Venetian Inquisition. More on this ina moment.2. Disturbing Testimony and a Deepening Mystery: Bruno’s Secret Society, theGiordanisti [Contents.html#rsec3]When Bruno, blissfully unaware of the nobleman’s intentions, told Mocenigo ofhis own intentions to return to Frankfurt, the latter acted. Tricking Bruno andlocking him in an attic, on May 22, 1592, Mocenigo betrayed him to the Venetiancivil authorities, who in turn handed him over to the Venetian Inquisition.10According to the English scholar Frances A. Yates, Mocenigo told the VenetianInquisition that Bruno’s views were clearly directed at the whole powerstructure of the Inquisition itself: The procedure which the Church uses to-day is not that which theApostles used: for they converted the people with preaching and the example of agood life, but now whoever does not wish to be a Catholic must endure punishmentand pain, for force is used and not love; the world cannot go on like this, forthere is nothing but ignorance and no religion which is good; the Catholicreligion pleases him more than any other, but this too has need of great reform;it is not good as it is now, but soon the world will see a general reform ofitself, for it is impossible that such corruptions should endure … 11What did Bruno mean by this?During his stay in Frankfurt, he had disclosed to the Venetian Giovanni BattistaCiotto—through whom Mocenigo had originally arranged for Bruno’s journey toVenice—that “he knew more than the Apostles” and that “if he had a mind to it,he could bring about that all the world should be one religion,”12 a religion,as we shall see, neither Protestant nor Catholic, nor even Christian, but“hermetic.”How did Bruno think he could possibly have achieved such a feat?Again, a hint is provided by Mocenigo in his testimony to the VenetianInquisition: I have not heard him (Bruno) say that he wanted to institute anew sect of Giordanisti in Germany, but he has affirmed that when he hadfinished certain of his studies he would be known as a great man …13Clearly, the Inquisition had some cause for concern, for the “Giordanisti” wererevealed to be a new secret society Bruno intended to found: In Mocenigo’s delation to the Inquisition against Bruno, hereports him as having said that he had intended to found a new sect under thename of philosophy. Other informers made the same insinuation, adding that Brunohad said that the sect was called the “Giordanisti” and appealed particularly tothe Lutherans in Germany.14Putting this together with Bruno’s travels throughout Italy, France, England,Switzerland, and Germany reveals the concerns not only of the Anglican andProtestant authorities that Bruno encountered, but also of the Catholics, for itis possible that Bruno was planting the seeds of his secret society and“hermetic revolution” during all his travels.Frances A. Yates poses the problem this way: It has occurred to me to wonder whether these rumored“Giordanisti” could have any connection with the unsolved mystery of the originsof the Rosicrucians who are first heard of in Germany in the early seventeenthcentury, in Lutheran circles.15As Yates herself understood, the answer to this question lay in Bruno’s art ofmemory, the very art whose secrets Mocenigo had lured the Nolan to Venice tolearn!16 Bruno “may be the real source of a Hermetic and mystical movement whichused, not the real architecture of ‘operative’ masonry, but the imaginary or‘speculative’ architecture of the art of memory as the vehicle of itsteachings.”17 Noting that early Rosicrucian documents speak of “mysterious rotaeor wheels, and of a sacred ‘vault’ the walls, ceiling and floor of which wasdivided into compartments each with their several figures and sentences,”18these are, as we shall discover in the next section, the exact mnemonic devicesused by Bruno to construct both his magic and his art of memory, and indeed, hishermetic cosmology. Bruno’s denunciation to the Inquisition, plus his ownstatements regarding his founding of a secret society to spread “philosophy,”i.e., hermetic teaching, would account for why his “secret,” which was “thecombination of the Hermetic beliefs with the techniques of the art of memory,”19went underground in the increasing religious intolerance of the late sixteenthand early seventeenth centuries.3. The Roman Inquisition and Bruno’s Execution [Contents.html#rsec4]But before we turn to the substance of Bruno’s doctrine, and why it posed such athreat to the financial powerhouse of Venice and the religious powerhouse of theVatican, we must deal with the final grisly details of his trial before theRoman Inquisition, for as we shall see, there are further clues to be foundthere. By the end of his trial before the Venetian Inquisition, Bruno hadrecanted “all of the heresies of which he was accused and threw himself on themercy of the judges.”20 But he still had to be handed over to the RomanInquisition and to its own trial.While the documents concerning Bruno’s Venetian and Roman trials are somewhatlacking (due to reasons we shall explore in the appendix to this book), oneGaspar Scioppus was a witness to Bruno’s execution. Scioppus details aninteresting list of the points for which Bruno was condemned and executed by theRoman Inquisition: … that there are innumerable worlds; that magic is a good andlicit thing; that the Holy Spirit is the anima mundi;21 that Moses did hismiracles by magic in which he was more proficient than the Egyptians; thatChrist was a Magus.22Yates notes, however, that the evidence remaining for the reasons for Bruno’scondemnation and execution are threadbare.23 We do know that the famous JesuitInquisitor, Robert Cardinal Bellarmine, the same Bellarmine who examinedGalileo, drew up a list of eight formal charges Bruno was required to recant,which, of course, the Nolan refused to do.24 It does appear, however, thatBruno’s condemnation was for specific conflicts with Catholic doctrine—includingthe deity of Christ—and that his Hermetic philosophy and support of theCopernican heliocentric theory were also at the root of it.25Indeed, in his letters to the Venetian Inquisition—and we must assume thesebecame part of the testimony against Bruno in Rome—Mocenigo drew up anastonishing list of complaints against the Nolan. According to the nobleman, Bruno maintained that the Catholic faith is “full of blasphemyagainst the majesty of God”; “that there is no distinction of persons in God,”(A difficult proposition to believe, as we shall discover in the next sectionand more fully in chapter two [Chapter002.html].) … “that the world is eternal”; “that there are infinite worlds”;“that all the operations of the world are guided by fate”;(A proposition having some credence, given Bruno’s heavy reliance uponastrological imagery and his belief in a multitude of inhabited worlds.) … and that “souls created through the operation of nature passfrom one animal to another.” In other accusations Mocenigo charged that Brunoaffirmed that “Christ was a rogue” and … that “the miracles of Christ and Hisdisciples were ‘apparent’”; and that He and His disciples were “magicians.” [Mocenigo’s letters to the Inquisition] further revealthat Bruno severely criticized monastic institutions, branding all monks as“asses,” and Catholic doctrines as “asinine”; that he considered a blasphemy theCatholic teaching that bread is transmuted into flesh; that he disapproved ofthe sacrifice of the Mass, stating that “there is no punishment of sins”; thathe denied the possibility of the Virgin Birth … 26and so on. In this list, we see Bruno following out the logical implications ofhis hermetic and magical system with a degree of rigor and personal abandon notshared by most other Renaissance Hermeticists.A list of eight charges were drawn up against Bruno, extracted from hispublications,27 and Bruno refused to recant or retract them, though he did throwhimself on the mercy of Pope Clement VIII. The pope proved to be anything butclement, handing Bruno to the secular authorities on January 20, 1600 for“extreme measures.”28On February 8, 1600, the Roman Holy Office, i.e. the Inquisition, afterreviewing the findings of the Roman trial, decided that Bruno was“‘pertinaciously’ persevering in his ‘errors,’”29 and even mentioned that whilein England Bruno had been “considered an ‘atheist’”30 for his publication of TheExpulsion of the Triumphant Beast. On February 16, 1600, after being given eightdays to recant, Bruno was led to the Campo di Fiori to be burnt alive. “Beforebeing given to the flames, he was shown the image of Christ, from which hedisdainfully turned his gaze,”31 the torch was set, and after a few agonizingmoments, the Nolan was no more.So what was it, precisely, about this man’s philosophy that posed such a threatto financial Venice, Oxford Anglican dons, Geneva Calvinists, German Lutherans,and the Vatican? What was it that allowed him to be accused of promoting a newreligion in the guise of a secret society, one which he hoped would sweep Europeboth of Protestantism and Catholicism, one in which he himself defended theism,but which also earned him in England the title of atheist? How does onereconcile all of this?To answer these questions, we must examine his doctrine much more closely, andin doing so, an astonishing set of implications—both very ancient in theirHermetic roots, and very modern in their physics corollaries—will emerge.B. BRUNO’S DOCTRINE AND THE ANCIENT METAPHOR [Contents.html#rsec5]1. The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast [Contents.html#rsec6]Bruno’s The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast was published in London in theyear 1584, and it was “the only work of Bruno’s to be singled out by the RomanInquisition at the summation of his trial.”32 For indeed, it was “owing to itsdaring ethical and epistemological speculations, its philosophy of nature, ofreligion, and of history,” that the work was “the embodiment of all that is mostheretical in the philosopher’s thinking.”’33 We get some measure both of the manand the work’s “irksome” heretical contents with Bruno’s reference to thecrucifixion of Christ as “a cabalistic tragedy.”34 The Expulsion is thus, in acertain sense, Bruno’s declaration of war against Christianity itself.35But the Nolan does not stop there.For example, in the “Explanatory Epistle” of the work, Bruno boldly declaresthat man is “a citizen and servant of the world,”36 a political view that wouldreemerge almost two centuries later with the credo of Adam Weishaupt and theBavarian Illuminati, and therefore hardly a view to endear him to the politicalauthorities of his own age. Indeed, if Frances A. Yates is correct in assumingthat there is some connection between Bruno’s secret society, the Giordanisti,and the emergence of the Rosicrucian Fraternity in Germany, there may be evendeeper connections between Bruno, his secret society, and the Illuminati of theeighteenth century than scholarship has hitherto assumed.The connection with the doctrines of the Illuminati is made even more cogentwhen one considers Bruno’s conception of revealed, or “positive,” religion, asImerti explains: Bruno’s concept of the Deity as pure rational principle, and asboth cause and effect, made all positive religions, with their emphasis on theanthropomorphic attributes of God, repugnant to him … his sly references tomonks, monasteries, and relics hint at his disapproval of some of the basictenets of Catholicism. His ironic allusions to the New Testament, andparticularly his satire of Christ, whose life on earth he allegorizes in Orion,and whose “trinitarian” nature, in Chiron the Centaur, are an implied refutationnot only of Catholicism but of Christianity itself.37Compare this summary of Bruno’s doctrine to the summary of Weishaupt’s doctrinegiven in the late eighteenth century by the French priest Abbé Augustin Barruel: The Religion of Christ is represented as a medley of the reveriesof Pythagoras, of Plato, and of Judaism. It is in vain for the Israelites tobelieve in the unity of God, in the coming of a Messiah … he will declare in hiscorrected Code, that the Religion of the Jews was but a modification of thereveries of the Egyptians, of Zoroaster, or of the Babylonians. To correct hisadepts, he teaches them to cast aside the Creation as a chimera unknown toantiquity, and to reduce all Religion to two Systems—The one, that of matterco-eternal with God, a part of God, proceeding from God, cast forth andseparated from God, in order to become the world—The other, matter co-eternalwith God, without being God, but worked by God, for the formation of theuniverse.38Clearly, Weishaupt’s Illuminism, as Barruel recounts it, is suffused withHermetic views that are, in the final analysis, almost identical with Bruno’s,making it possible that Bruno was successful in establishing his “Giordanistas”in Germany, and that they may have had some deep connection to the subsequentemergence of Rosicrucianism and Illuminism in that land.As we shall discover momentarily, however, Imerti’s statement that Brunorejected anthropomorphism is not entirely correct, for in Bruno’s hands, suchanthropomorphism becomes the signal of a profound underlying metaphor ofphysics, mind, memory, and the operations of magic. Nonetheless, it remains truethat Bruno’s hermeticism was the repudiation of all revealed religions.39The reason for this repudiation may not be entirely clear until one recalls thatBruno, like many Hermeticists of the High Renaissance, viewed the origin of allpositive or revealed religion as being from Egypt. As Imerti explains: In his interpretation of the Old Testament Bruno’s views clashwith both Christian and Jewish teachings. He regards its stories as fables, ormetaphorical representations of history, passed on from the Egyptians to theBabylonians and then to the Hebrews. He adduces as evidence of his premise the“metaphor of the raven,” which, he declares, was “first found and developed inEgypt and then taken by the Hebrews, through whom this knowledge was transmittedfrom Babylonia, in the form of a story … ” Bruno is struck by the variations of the Osiris myth inthe ancient Mediterranean civilizations, to which he makes a brief allusion.However, he specifically points out analogies between such Greek myths as thatof Apollo and the Raven and the biblical Noah and the Raven, between Deucalionand Noah, and between Cerus and Jonah and the Whale. The source of the myths shared by the Greeks with theHebrews, he insists, is not Hebrew but Egyptian. Egypt, indeed, is for Bruno thesource of all the myths and fables of the Mediterranean world, all beingpoetical representations of events dating back to the dawn of Westerncivilization.40As we shall see, this “Egyptian monogenesis” also included a doctrine of aprimordial trinity, such that Bruno came to the conclusion that its ultimateorigins were not in revelation, but in reason. Hence, unlike most Hermeticistsof the High Renaissance who were busily trying to reconcile elements of Hermeticdoctrine with Christianity, Bruno was busily proclaiming their divorce, and withit, repudiating the need for special revelation and authoritystructures—Protestant or Catholic. To put it succinctly, Bruno believed thatonce the Hermetic cosmological doctrine was stripped of its religious overlay,religion (in the standard sense) was no longer necessary. We will expand onBruno’s exposition of this metaphor later in this chapter and in the nextchapter, but for now, our concentration must remain fixed on The Expulsion ofthe Triumphant Beast.One implication of this sort of Hermetic interpretation of the EgyptianMonogenesis is that all of nature becomes a manifestation of Deity, thus leavingnature as “the teacher of all rational beings.”41 As a result, the political—andtherefore, the financial—vision that Bruno embodies in The Expulsion is: a society in which the natural religion of the Egyptians, in itspurest sense, and the speculative intellect of the Greeks would coincide in asociopolitical structure patterned after that of the Roman Republic. The sourceof the state, which Bruno conceives of as “an ethical substance,” is God, “theabsolute reality, or reality which is the principle of all realities.” The stateenvisaged by the philosopher would be one containing a unity of law andreligion, rather than a separation of “the divine from law and civil life.”42While this is true as far as it goes, it misses the point of what Bruno isadvocating when he talks about “law” in one important respect: in the ancientRoman Republic, law was an external compulsion backed by the force of the state.With Bruno, law is an interior illumination within individuals, and statute lawis its organic outgrowth.Bruno, in other words, is advocating the very revolutionary principle of thesovereignty of the individual person, and this, as we shall see in subsequentchapters, posed a definite threat not only to the religious and politicalauthorities of his day, but to the financial powers—like Venice—as well. Theresult of this view—and here as elsewhere Bruno traces out all its logicalimplications without hesitation—is that all the gods, including Jove or Yahweh,should be made to serve man. After all, the gods were but the creations of theultimate Principle, or nature, and thus were the creations of man himself. Itis, says Bruno, “by the grace of the gods” that it is permitted to man to be “atliberty to make them serve us, to take and accommodate them at our convenienceand pleasure.”43Once again placing the origin of these doctrines in Egypt and its magicalscience, and not in a special revelation, Bruno calls the Jews “the excrement ofEgypt.” He holds that Moses’ knowledge was not the result of revelation, but ofhis learning in the ancient magical science, or scientific magic, of Egypt.44Such propositions were, of course, heretical, whether one was a Protestant or aCatholic, and had Bruno ever managed to journey to Orthodox Christian Europe,would have been viewed as heretical there as well. But the catalogue we havereviewed above would be incomplete if we did not also mention Bruno’s othergreat heresy—at least as far as Catholic Europe at the time was concerned.Namely, his view that the Earth was merely one of innumerable planets, thatthere were a multitude of inhabited worlds, that the universe was teaming withlife, and that the Earth did indeed revolve around the Sun.45 This view, as weshall see in chapter two [Chapter002.html], is a product of his Hermeticism, forHermeticism held that the cosmos is literally teeming with life. His scientificand philosophical influence, and particularly his reliance upon a kind of“mathematical magic and philosophy” is even thought to have profoundlyinfluenced Gottfried Leibniz, the inventor (along with Isaac Newton), ofintegral and differential calculus.46With this background in hand, we are now in a position to examine Bruno’sdoctrine in detail, concentrating on his works The Expulsion of the TriumphantBeast, On Cause, Principle, and Unity, and On Magic.a. The Contradictory Moral Nature of Yahweh [Contents.html#rsec7]Bruno begins The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast with a lengthy “ExplanatoryEpistle,” in which he has the following things to say about Jove, the commonname in his time for the God of the Old Testament, Yahweh. Jove, or Yahweh, heexplains, is introduced, as is vulgarly described, as a god who possessedvirtues and kindness, and possessed human and sometimes brutal and bestialdissoluteness, frivolity, and frailty, as it is imagined that he possessed whenit is reputed that he changed himself into those various subjects or forms inorder to indicate the mutation of the various affects that Jove, the soul, andman incur, finding themselves in this fluctuating matter.47In other words, Yahweh’s two-faced moral character, now benevolent, now violentand murderous, is a result of his participation in the mutable, fluctuatingworld of matter. Because of this, Bruno goes on to note, Yahweh really“represents each one of us,”48 or to put it differently, the supreme God of theOld Testament is really man, or at least, a representation of man. Given Bruno’shermetic background and familiarity with all manner of hermetic and alchemicaltexts, what he is in effect saying is that all the gods are manifestations ofever-transmuting matter, and that Yahweh is, in the final analysis, amanifestation of the Philosophers’ Stone. Bruno is, in short, a kind ofproto-transhumanist.This has a social consequence, namely, the standard and endless Yahwistdivisions of the social space.49 In a lengthy diatribe against the CalvinistProtestants, Bruno traces out the morally contradictory character of Yahweh in areview of how this is reflected in Calvinist doctrine and practice: And in conclusion, let her see whether, while they uttergreetings of peace, they do not carry, wherever they enter, the Knife ofDivision and the Fire of Dispersion, taking away the son from his father,neighbor from neighbor, the inhabitant from his country, and causing otherdivorces, horrendous and against every nature and law. Let her see whether,while they call themselves ministers of one who resurrects the dead and healsthe infirm, it is they who, worse than all the others whom the earth feeds,cripple the healthy and kill the living, not so much with fire and with thesword as with their pernicious tongues. Let her see what sort of peace andharmony they propose to the wretched peoples, and whether they perhaps want andeagerly desire that all the world agree with and consent to their malicious andmost presumptuous ignorance, and approve their wicked conscience, while theywant neither to agree with, nor consent to, any law, justice, and doctrine; andlet her see whether in all the rest of the world and of the centuries thereappear so much discord and dissonance as is evidenced among them. So among ten thousand such pedants there is not one whohas not compiled his own catechism, and who if he has not published it, at leastis about to publish that one which approves of no other institution but his own,finding in all the others something to condemn, reprove, and doubt; besides, themajority of them are found in disagreement among themselves, rescinding todaywhat they wrote the day before. Let her see what success these have, and what customs theyinspire and provoke in others in that which appertains to acts of justice andcompassion and the conservation and increase of public wealth … let her seewhether they are the appropriators of the goods of others or, rather, thebestowers of their own goods; and, finally, let her see whether those who sidewith them increase and stabilize public wealth, as their opponents andpredecessors used to do, or, rather, together with these, dissipate, dismember,and devour it; and whether, while they belittle good works, they extinguish inpeople all enthusiasm for the construction of new works and the preservation ofthe old.50Note Bruno’s indirect attack on Calvinism’s approval of interest-bearing debtand its relationship to “the public wealth,” in itself an attack that would beof great concern to the merchant bankers of Venice and northern Italy. It is butone aspect of the schisms in the social space induced by the alliance betweenYahwism and such financial practices, producing, as Imerti observes, “aninsecure individual, convinced that only wealth and power can give him a senseof security.”51 For Bruno, championing the individual as a direct manifestationof Deity, a just social order could not come about without converting thesedesires into temperance and reason, without the expulsion of vices, representedby the “triumphant beast,” Jove.52Bruno does not stop merely with attributing mutability to Yahweh, nor withattacks on the growing schisms of the social space it produced in its Protestantforms, but even puts the mutable character of Yahweh into a speech that Yahwehhimself delivers to the council of gods, a speech in which Yahweh points out hisown moral schizophrenia. “Justice,” says Yahweh, by which Fate governs the rulers of the world, has completelydeprived us of that authority and power which we so badly employed, ourignominies being revealed and laid bare before the eyes of mortals, and mademanifest to them; and it causes heaven itself, with such clear evidence, as thestars are clear and evident, to render us testimony of our misdeeds. For thereare clearly seen the fruits, the relics, the reports, the rumors, the writings,the histories of our adulteries, incests, fornications, wraths, disdains,rapines, and other iniquities and crimes; and to reward ourselves for ourtransgressions, we have committed more transgressions, elevating to heaven thetriumphs of vice and the seats of wickedness, leaving virtues and Justicebanished, and neglected in hell.53Yahweh, in other words, had “for a long time led a life of dissoluteness,devoting himself almost exclusively to amours and to warlike enterprises … ”54Determined to repent for such behavior, he summons the council of the gods onthe Feast of the Gigantomachy55—or War of the Giants and Titans in Greekmythology, a point by which Bruno subtly stresses the idea that Yahweh’sbehavior is no less a moral reflection of human passions and contradictions thanthat of the myths of the gods of the Greeks.As such, Bruno speaks in the first part of the second dialogue of The Expulsionof the Triumphant Beast of the love “of the Divinity which is above all Jovesand all heavens,”56 indicating that it is Yahweh himself who is the “triumphantbeast” to be expelled from society, along with the vices he represents, whichare to be expelled within man himself.To sum up, thus far Bruno has accomplished the following: 1) Critiqued the Yahwist moral contradiction; 2) Exposed it as the basis for (endless) divisions of the social space(in its Protestant and Calvinist form); 3) Noted that, since such mutable behavior is evident, that Yahweh cannotlogically represent the divine order of “mutable permanence”; 4) Noted that the real origin of various doctrines comes from Egypt, andthat therefore, 5) No positive or special revelation is needed, since nature revealsitself to one and all immediately; and thus, 6) Challenged the religious authority of elites based on that revelation,while 7) Championing the idea of man as a “citizen of the world,” thuschallenging political elites; and finally, 8) Subtly challenged the Calvinist doctrine of debt-interest in the handsof a private monopoly by distinguishing it from “the public wealth,” which is,in the final analysis, a not-so-subtle attack on the very idea of privatemonopoly central banking, that is, upon the banking practices of the northernItalian city-states, Florence and Venice, themselves.It is little wonder, then, that both Venice and the Vatican determined to endthe life of this man, and it is interesting to note that, like the eightfoldsummary of the implications of Bruno’s doctrine above, the final charges broughtagainst him by the Roman Inquisition also numbered eight heresies.b. Yahweh Not the First Cause: Man as the Medium and Philosophers’ Stone[Contents.html#rsec8]But the Nolan was just getting started.In his “Explanatory Epistle” at the beginning of The Expulsion, Bruno commentsat length on why Yahweh cannot be the First Cause, that is to say the true god,by drawing an astonishingly alchemical conclusion: We here, then, have a Jove, not taken as too legitimate and gooda vicar or lieutenant of the first principle and universal cause, but well takenas something variable, subject to the Fate of Mutation; he, however, knowingthat together in one infinite entity and substance there are infinite andinnumerable particular natures (of which he is one individual), which, sincethey in substance, essence, and nature are one, likewise, by reason of thenumber through which they pass, incur innumerable vicissitudes and a kind ofmotion and mutation. Each one of these natures then, and particularly Jove’s,finds itself as such an individual, with such a composition, with such accidentsand circumstances, having been placed in number, because of differences whicharise from contraries, all of which are reduced to one original and firstcontrary, which is the first principle of all the others, the proximateefficients of every change and vicissitude. Because of this, just as he, fromone who at first was not Jove, afterward was made Jove, so he, from one who atpresent is Jove, finally will be other than Jove. He knows that of the eternal corporeal substance (which isnot producible ex nihilo, nor reducible ad nihilum, but rarefiable, condensable,formable, arrangeable, and “fashionable”) the composition is dissolved, thecomplexion is changed, the figure is modified, the being is altered, the fortuneis varied, only the elements remaining what they are in substance, that sameprinciple persevering which was always the one material principle, which is thetrue substance of things, eternal, ingenerable, and incorruptible.57The alchemical conclusion of the second paragraph in the above quotation isimportant, for it is clear that Bruno envisions a kind of perpetuallytransmuting “something” that underlies all existence, and ascribes to it theincorruptibility and indestructibility that alchemists ascribed to thePhilosophers’ Stone.58 So a closer look at this unexpected alchemical turn is inorder.This eternal, yet information-creating, transmuting substance or substrate isviewed by Bruno as inhabiting the entire universe, in a fashion analogous to thesoul inhabiting the body. “In short,” says Arthur D. Imerti, summarizing Bruno’sviews, “it is, according to the philosopher, the ‘substance which is trulyman.’”59 Man, in other words, is that eternal, transmutative substance, is thePhilosophers’ Stone, a view which anticipates by almost three hundred and fiftyyears the debates within modern physics over the Anthropic CosmologicalPrinciple. In this, Bruno is faithfully reflecting the Hermetic doctrine of manas a microcosm or “small universe,” and of the universe as a makanthropos, or“great man.” 60But in order to make these parallels with modern scientific views even morecompelling, we must now turn our attention to the Nolan’s On Cause, Principle,and Unity, and his treatise On Magic.2. Cause, Principle, and Unity, and On Magic [Contents.html#rsec9]a. The Substrate and Magic [Contents.html#rsec10]Like The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast, Bruno’s On Cause, Principle, andUnity was written and published in England in 1584, and thus may function as akind of philosophical commentary on the more popularly-written Expulsion. In itBruno outlines “his vision of an infinite universe in which he sought tore-unify terrestrial physics with celestial physics on the basis of a principleof universal becoming.”61 This principle of universal becoming—or to put it intomore modern physics terms, perpetual creation of information—is of course thesame philosophical cosmology that underwrote alchemy with its emphasis on thePhilosophers’ Stone as a transmutative information-creating medium. In Bruno’shands, however, it also functions, as we have seen in our examination of TheExpulsion of the Triumphant Beast, as the basis for his assault on all revealed,positive religion, i.e., on Judaism and Christianity (and by implication,Islam).As we saw previously, by equating the physical medium with mankind himself, orrather by understanding it as a kind of “great man” or makanthropos, the entiresystem of theology, and what Bruno understood by the term “God” is completelyreoriented. With it the meaning of human life, and how we approach God, is alsowholly transformed,62 a transformation that is in itself alchemical. Bruno’sclaims for his magical and hermetic philosophy-religion are thus quite sweeping. He claims that this new vision will reconcile us with the divinelaw which governs nature, and free us from the fear of imaginary divinities,cruel and unfathomable, who look down from heavenly heights, controlling thesublunary world in a mysterious way. Human beings believe that they are enclosedin an inferior world subject to generation and corruption, but this is a simpleillusion.63Because this world of becoming is viewed by Bruno as an illusion, one is temptedto see in him a Western manifestation of a Vedic outlook, mediated by theHermetic, Neoplatonic, and magical tradition in which he, like so many otherItalian Renaissance Hermeticists, was formed.For Bruno, there is but one ultimate ground of being, but this is firstdifferentiated into Pure Act, or God, and pure potency,64 or eternal matter. Wemay symbolize this ultimate ground of being, this void which is an absoluteNo-thing, by the empty hyper-set Ø. By envisioning this No-thing as havingundergone some process of differentiation of circumscription—a process we shallsymbolize with the paragraph symbol, ¶, to represent the “writing around” orcircumscription [images/f0024-01.jpg]—we may symbolize what Bruno is getting atby calling God “pure Act” and matter “pure Potency” (leaving for chapter two[Chapter002.html] a fuller exposition of this “topological metaphor of themedium”):[images/f0024-02.jpg]But in our previous expositions of this topological metaphor of the physicalmedium, we have noted that the two “differentiated nothings” that result fromthis process, Ø1 and Ø2, share a common surface, denoted by the partialderivative symbol ∂, thusly:[images/f0024-03.jpg]So what is the common surface between the two “differentiated nothings,” or Godas Pure Act and matter as pure potency, in Bruno’s view?It was precisely through these two eternal principles, pure Act and purePotency, that it appeared to Bruno “that man, endowed with a rational soul and aspirit to mediate between the soul and his elementary body, could link himselfto that privileged cosmic point on the boundary between the sensible andintelligible which would allow him to grasp the archetypal forms, the actualgenerating models of every sensible reality … ”65 In other words, man himselfwas the boundary condition, the common surface, between the two principles.It is this fact that forms the basis for why Bruno believed that man could tapinto and direct the operations of nature via a kind of natural magic, byimpressing those operations within the human psyche itself via his art ofmemory. In fact, Bruno is very direct in his statement on this account in Cause,Principle, and Unity, for he states unequivocally that “we can … grasp thesubstratum and principle of natural things,” i.e., that eternal No-thing, “indiverse ways.”66 And he is equally explicit about the methods that constitutethose “diverse ways,” for they include “natural and magical methods, and moreineffectively according to rational and mathematical methods.”67 Indeed, as weshall see, Bruno even envisions a kind of “mathematical magic,” similar innature to the kind of simple topological exposition we have given above of histhought.The attentive reader will have noted that by distinguishing the initial Nothingor Ø into differentiated No-things of Pure Act and Pure Potency—Ø1 and Ø2respectively—that Bruno has in fact implied that the initial No-thing, prior toits differentiation, contains those contraries. If he or she noted this, thereader is correct, for in that initial No-thing, all contraries coinhere: “Thereheight is depth, the abyss an inaccessible light, gloom is clarity, great issmall, the confused is distinct, discord is amity, the divisible is indivisible,the atom is immensity—and all inversely.”68 And of course, this No-thing is alsoa “great man,” and thus a kind of “masculine androgyny,” combining the masculineand feminine.69 Even being and non-being is not, for Bruno, a real distinction,for both coincide in that original undifferentiated No-thing, and thus, thedistinction between them is only notional.70 Similarly, since this No-thing—inall its derivative forms—belongs to the nature of the physical medium itself,none of the specific information content of any individual form derived from itis ever lost: “Form,” says Bruno, “cannot be annihilated.”71 And again, it isthe soul, the boundary condition or common surface between all manner ofdifferentiated No-things, that is the Differentiator, as Bruno notes in apassage citing Empedocles.72b. The Medium, The Metaphor, and the Magician [Contents.html#rsec11]Indeed, it is this “boundary condition” of the soul that is the basis for theNolan’s philosophy of magic. Anticipating the views of the modern biologist Dr.Rupert Sheldrake, again by hundreds of years, Bruno states that “the soul has animmediate and sudden presence with the most distant things, which are not joinedto it by any motion … but rather are directly present in a certain sense.”73 Toput it in modern physics terms, for Bruno, the soul, the mind, is a non-localphenomenon.74 In order to understand what chain of reasoning led him to thisconclusion, we need to reprise the logic of his argument thus far in astep-by-step fashion: 1) There is an underlying physical medium or substrate, in which allcontraries coincide, that is an absolute unitary No-thing or Ø; 2) Thus, this No-thing has no location, since space, time, and place areall effects of its subsequent differentiations, as specific forms or informationcontent of other forms; 3) Possessing all contraries, this No-thing is thus both impersonal andpersonal, masculine and feminine, and matter, and mind. We shall have more tosay about this point in the next chapter.It is this third point, a No-thing that is also present in some degree inEverything, that allows for the practice of magic, for the magician is nothingbut “a wise man who has the power to act.”75 But this “power to act” isunderstood by Bruno to exist in three distinct kinds of magic, “the divine, thephysical, and the mathematical.”76 But what does he mean by “mathematicalmagic”?A hint has already been provided by the topological notations of the metaphor,and indeed, for Bruno, such mathematical magic is expression of all the“derivative and differentiated No-things,” and is a kind of “reverseengineering” of the process of derivations from the initial No-thing, or Ø: … (Magicians) take it as axiomatic that, in all the panoramabefore our eyes, God acts on the gods; the gods act on the celestial or astralbodies, which are divine bodies; these act on the spirits who reside in andcontrol the stars, one of which is the earth; the spirits act on the elements,the elements on the compounds, the compounds on the senses; the senses on thesoul, and the soul on the whole animal. This is the descending scale.77Note that “God” here designates the primordial substrate or No-thing, while“gods” would include, as Bruno made clear in the Expulsion, those higher mutableforms, including Yahweh, derived from it. Thus, the magician ascends back upthis “descending scale” and operates on its highest levels, in order to affectthe lower ones. Putting it into the terms of the mathematical magic or metaphor,Bruno is suggesting that subsequent derivatives from the initial No-thing can bedescribed with the formal explicitness of mathematics. Thus “mathematical magic”resembles what we would call ceremonial magic, but with a difference. “Here,”says Bruno, the mathematical type of magic is not defined by the usuallymentioned fields of mathematics, i.e., geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, optics,music, etc., but rather by its likeness and relationship to these disciplines.It is similar to geometry in that it uses figures and symbols, to music in itschants, to arithmetic in its numbers and manipulations, to astronomy in itsconcerns for times and motions, and to optics in making observations. Ingeneral, it is similar to mathematics as a whole either because it mediatesbetween divine and natural actions, or because it shares or lacks something ofboth.78Had Bruno lived in a later time, he would have recognized that what he wascalling for was a higher order mathematical language, the language of topology.However, as we have seen, the Nolan also believed that the physical medium wasboth matter and mind, and this forms the crucial bridge to what he means bymathematical magic, and to his ars memoriae or Art of Memory, for “Whoever isaware of this indissoluble continuity of the soul and its necessary connectionto a body will possess an important principle both to control natural things andto understand them better.”79 In other words, the higher steps of derivatives,those closest to the initial “No-thing,” are present within the mind, within theindividual soul, and can be used to order the mind, the psyche, via archetypalforms, and these in turn can be employed to order the cosmos.And with that, we arrive at last at:c. Bruno’s Art of Memory [Contents.html#rsec12]When the Venetian Inquisition, duly suspicious of Bruno and his Art of Memory,questioned him about that subject, the Nolan gave a somewhat evasive response: I gained such a name that the King Henri III summoned me one dayand asked me whether the memory which I had and which I taught was a naturalmemory or obtained by magic art; I proved to him that it was not obtained bymagic art but by science. After that I printed a book on memory entitled Deumbris idearum which I dedicated to His Majesty, whereupon he made me an endowedreader.80Bruno, of course, was not being entirely truthful, since in his world view, asis by now evident, there is little distinction between science and magic.Indeed, Frances A. Yates is quick to point out that the Venetian Inquisitors … had only to look into the De umbris idearum to recognize atonce … that it contained allusions to the magical statues of the Asclepius and alist of one hundred and fifty magic images of the stars. Clearly there was magicin Bruno’s art of memory … 81It should therefore come as no surprise that the Venetian nobleman Mocenigo’sdenunciation of Bruno to the Inquisition came after “he had learned the full‘secrets’ of his art of memory.”82 It is thus Bruno’s art of memory that stands“at the very centre of the life and death of Bruno,”83 for it is his art ofmemory that combines his magical practice, his philosophy, and his program for aHermetic religious revolution. One might go so far as to say that Bruno’s Art ofMemory is his religious revolution, that it is his “mathematical magic.”This system is embodied in a complex construction of magical memory wheels,i.e., circular charts, nested one within the other, full of zodiacal,astrological, and magical symbolisms. By rotating these charts, variouscombinations of symbols, and hence of magical psychic functions, would becreated, which Bruno believed potentially encompassed all the major operationsor processes within the universe: Did he intend that there would be formed in the memory usingthese ever-changing combinations of astral images some kind of alchemy of theimagination, a philosopher’s stone in the psyche through which every possiblearrangement and combination of objects in the lower world—plants, animals,stones—would be perceived and remembered? And that, in the forming and reformingof the inventor’s images in accordance with the forming and reforming of theastral images on the central wheel, the whole history of man would be rememberedfrom above, as it were, all his discoveries, thoughts, philosophies,productions? Such a memory would be the memory of a divine man, of aMagus with divine powers through his imagination harnessed in the workings ofthe cosmic powers. And such an attempt would rest on the Hermetic assumptionthat man’s (mind) is divine, related in its origin to the star-governors of theworld, able both to reflect and to control the universe.84The inmost of these embedded, nested wheels of Bruno’s memory system representedthe Hermetic divine powers: the celestial motions of the stars, theconstellations, and planets. The next wheels, moving outward, represented themineral, the vegetable, and the animal worlds respectively, an exact duplicationof the order of descent in the ancient metaphor, for the highest world is themineral, the next highest, the vegetable, and the lowest, the animal. Note thatthis order—mineral to vegetable to animal—is roughly that of modern scientificcosmology, which begins with the creation of the elements, then the emergence ofsimple life, then plants, and finally animals, thus lending some credence to theidea that the ancient Hermetic cosmology might similarly be a legacy of a veryhigh science from High Antiquity. Consequently, Bruno’s memory wheels are meantto represent “all arts and sciences” and, as the wheels are rotated, torepresent all possible combinations of those worlds. Again, had Bruno livedthree hundred years later, this system of rotation within rotation withinrotation, creating ever varied forms, would have been known as dynamic torsion.Memory is thus a Platonic recollection [images/f0030-01.jpg] of the world offorms, of Plato’s “mathematicals”85 and is thus itself yet another alchemicalPhilosophers’ Stone.The key to this vast astral memory machine is the inmost wheel, representing themotions of the heavens. Bruno is here reflecting his reliance upon Hermeticism,which betrays its Egyptian origins in its, and his, belief that “man is in hisorigin divine, and organically related to the star-governors of the world.”86But there is more to this than meets the eye, for in Bruno’s memory wheels, … the images of the stars are intermediaries between the ideas inthe super-celestial world and the sub-celestial elemental world. By arranging ormanipulating or using the star-images one is manipulating forms which are astage nearer to reality than the objects in the inferior world, all of whichdepend on the stellar influences. One can act on the inferior world, change thestellar influences on it, if one knows how to arrange and manipulate thestar-images. In fact the star-images are the ‘shadows of ideas,’ shadows ofreality which are nearer to reality than the physical shadows in the lowerworld.87The stars, in other words, like man himself, are the boundary conditions, thecommon surfaces, between two worlds, and as such, there is an intimaterelationship between them and man, such that man, by manipulating their forms orimages in the psyche, can manipulate their influences in the real world. Again,Bruno is maintaining that there is a direct relationship between the mind andthe physical medium.It is important to pause here, and reflect why this one fact alone would havebeen perceived as such a threat to the financial and banking powers of Venice,for as I pointed out in the previous book in this series, Babylon’s Banksters:The Alchemy of Deep Physics, High Finance, and Ancient Religion, the connectionbetween astrology, religion, and private banking is an ancient one, and to someextent, the astrological influence over finance is a well-known “secret.”88Bruno, by exposing the whole alchemical metaphor and alchemical magic of thesystem and making it public, thus constituted an implicit threat against theprivate money power of Venice and the other Italian city-states and theirbanking dynasties, and to their possible hidden knowledge of financial cyclesbeing coupled to celestial ones. We shall see in greater detail in the nextchapter why this is so.But we are able to make some approximation of why Bruno’s magical and hermeticrevolution was a threat not only to the religious powers of the day, but also tothe financial ones, when we realize that his art of memory was nothing but amagical, alchemical operation on the psyche of man himself,89 for by reproducing“the divine organization in memory” it is possible to access “the powers of thecosmos, which are in man himself.”90 In other words, the fecundity of themetaphor, creating ever more differentiations, is not only a cosmological one,but as we shall discover in the next chapter, a psychic and financial one. It isa process of the production of a surplus of information, without debt. Such a“Platonic” view of the endless productivity of the medium could not help but bechallenged by Venice, locked as it was into a closed Aristotelian physics and“financial” system, about which we shall have much more to say in a subsequentchapter.“Here was a man,” says Frances Yates, “who would stop at nothing, who would useevery magical procedure however dangerous and forbidden, to achieve thatorganisation of the psyche from above, through contact with the cosmicpowers.”91 Those methods of organization, and the very cosmic powers themselves,were the mathematical, topological forms of the constant creation of informationvia endless “derivatives” and common surfaces from the primordial No-Thing. Theastral wheel of Bruno’s memory wheels was thus a kind of astral-magical memorymachine, and “the master mind who had the sky and all its movements andinfluences magically imprinted on memory through magic images was indeed inpossession of a ‘secret’ worth knowing!”92 Indeed, if—as I outlined in Babylon’sBanksters—the knowledge of financial activity was coordinated to planetarypositions, and if, as I averred there, it is a rather carefully guarded secret,then Bruno, on that basis alone, constituted a threat to the powers-that-were inhis day.Indeed, in his book On Seals, Bruno described the very first seal on his wheelas “the Field.”93 This “field,” as Yates notes, “is the memory, or the phantasy,the ample folds of which are to be worked upon by the art of places andimages.”94 Once again, the memory, like the physical medium, is a “field ofpotential information,” to employ yet another modern physics metaphor that Brunoseems to have anticipated, and one, moreover, with its own Vedic overtones.95In Bruno’s hands, this vast system of memory, magic, and philosophicalreflection on the meaning and implications of the topological metaphor wastransformed into an extraordinary program of a kind of Hermetic ecumenism, bywhich he hoped to resolve and supplant the divided Christianity of Europe with anew religion based on the reasonable implications of that metaphor. “By usingmagical or talismanic images as memory-images, the Magus” aspired to a kind of“universal knowledge, and also powers, obtaining through the magicalorganisation of the imagination a magically powerful personality, tuned in, asit were, to the powers of the cosmos.”96 Like the revisionist EgyptologistSchwaller de Lubicz centuries later, Bruno even recognized that the hieroglyphsof Egypt were deliberately chosen as analogical, archetypal images of operationsor functions in the intelligible world of the psyche, and thus, as magicalmemory talismans.97If all this sounds rather fanciful, from one perspective, it is. But Bruno’sbasic philosophy is based upon the notion that the individual mind and soul isnot a localized phenomenon within the body, and his memory images and the way heused them are anticipations of something very modern, and with a proven—thoughlittle understood—track record: remote viewing. Indeed, within the technique ofremote viewing, the viewer first clears his mind, then focuses attention on the“target,” drawing an initial “squiggle,” an image or ideogram, whichencapsulates all the information that is subsequently to be opened andelaborated upon by the viewer through controlled mental processes. This“squiggle” or ideogram is thus a kind of psychic “zip file.”98 And like Brunocenturies before, the scientists and participants in these remote viewingprograms came to the conclusion that the mind, and its memory, were indeednon-local affairs, and that any individual could indeed access the vast sea of“information in the field” that constitutes the substrate to mind and themedium. It constituted—and please note the financial metaphor—a vast treasury ofinformation that could be drawn upon by anyone, anytime, anywhere, provided oneknew the proper “magical” techniques. Mind and memory were thus, for Bruno, akind of metaphysical treasury of intellectual money, a medium of the exchange ofinformation, accessible to all. As we shall see in the next chapter, this tooconstituted a threat to the papacy, with its doctrine of the Treasury of Merit.It was small wonder then that Bruno, having demoted Yahweh to one of manymutable gods, should have caused the ire of the Vatican. And we have providedhints, in this chapter, of why he should have been so anxiously sought by aVenetian nobleman, who, having learned the Nolan’s secrets of magical memory,should also have turned him over to the Inquisition. But why would Bruno havebeen denounced as an atheist in England, and received as the warmest theist inGermany? How does one explain this apparent contradictory assessment of the manand his memory magic? And why would it take a combination of Vatican bishops andVenetian banksters to bring him down?To answer this, we must go into fuller detail, exploring in the next chapter therelationship of that topological metaphor of the medium to money and politics,and in the subsequent chapters, the rise of merchant banking in the Italiancity-states.________________________1 Giordano Bruno, “Explanatory Epistle” in The Expulsion of the TriumphantBeast, trans. from the Italian by Arthur D.

Dr. Sheldrake argues for thisposition on the basis of the fact that various animal species, unconnected toeach other via time or location, seem to somehow learn from each other over vastdistances and time. For example, if a species of monkeys isolated on an islandlearns a particular thing, the same species isolated on another island seemssomehow to learn from the first group, even though there has been no actualphysical contact between the members of the two groups.75 Bruno, “On Magic,” in Cause, Principle, and Unity and Essays on Magic, p.107.76 Ibid.77 Ibid78 Ibid., p. 108.79 Ibid., p. 116.80 Documenti della vita di G.B., ed.

Jesusanswered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?”—Gospel of St. John, 10:33-34, citing Psalm 82:6“The perfection of all that we see, come from contraries, through contraries,into contraries, to contraries. And where there is contrariety, there is actionand reaction, there is motion, there is diversity, there is number, there isorder, there are degrees, there is succession, there is vicissitude. ”—Giordano Bruno1GIORDANO BRUNO, LIKE MOST Renaissance “humanists,” was really a Hermeticist.That is, like fellow philosophers of the Renaissance such as Pico De Mirandola(1463–1494), Tommaso Campanella (1568–1639), and so many others, Bruno wasinspired by the appearance in Italy of a body of works purporting to becompositions of the ancient Egyptian philosopher-priest Hermes Trismegistus, orthe “Thrice Great Hermes,” a body of works known as the Corpus Hermetica or theCorpus Hermeticum.How that body of works came to Italy is itself a part of this story, andaccordingly, we will spend some time in its telling, rehearsing the efforts ofscholars from the Renaissance to our own time to pin down its elusive origins.Similarly, we shall also have to examine its presentation of the ancientmetaphor for which Bruno gave his life, by way of a wider examination of thatmetaphor in other cultures, in order to ascertain just how, and why, theHermetic construction of that Metaphor, and Bruno’s adaptation of it, spelledsuch a threat to the financial and religious powers of Venice and Rome. As such,this will be a somewhat lengthy and technical chapter, but nonetheless anessential one for the understanding of the deep relationships between theMetaphor, the mind, the physical medium, and money.A cautionary note, however, is in order. In viewing Bruno’s martyrdom as beingin part the result of the threat that his system posed for Venetian—and indeedall north Italian—merchant banking and finance, we are, of course, departingfrom standard academic analyses of the motivations of the powers behind hisdeath, which would view such motivations in strictly religious, theological, andpolitical terms. Yet, it seems an obvious though overlooked thing to do, sinceVenice so profoundly symbolized the rising financial and banking class of thelate Renaissance and early modern period. Therefore, though this analysis isspeculative, and perhaps even highly so, it is nonetheless long overdue.A. THE ORIGINS OF THE CORPUS HERMETICUM [Contents.html#rsec13]1. The “Author” of the Corpus Hermeticum [Contents.html#rsec14]The Hermetica, or as they are also known, the Corpus Hermeticum, are a body ofwritings in Greek and Latin that purport to be the works of the ancient Egyptianwisdom-god Thoth, or, as he was known to the Greeks, Hermes Trismegistus, the“Thrice Greatest Hermes.” In this one fact there lies quite a tale, as we shalldiscover in this chapter.The story begins, in fact, with something of a confusion, for when Alexander theGreat’s armies swept into Egypt and eventually conquered that country, theconquerors quickly deduced that the Egyptians’ Thoth was one and the same astheir own Hermes, and thus began that merger “of two deities of highly divergentorigin”2 that was to cause such interpretive confusion throughout the ages. Theconfusion over the authorship of this mysterious body of work is also reflectedin its influence on western philosophical history since its first resurgenceduring the Renaissance. It has been viewed, for example, as a kind of“proto-revelation” given to Egypt that in many respects closely paralleled thatof Christianity, particularly in its apparent endorsement of a doctrine of aTrinity.3 Similarly, it has been viewed as a banner beneath which philosophicalwarfare was waged against the constrictions of the Aristotelian theology of themedieval Catholic Church.4 Bruno, of course, appealed to it in part to championthe Copernican theory, and indeed, Copernicus himself appealed to the Hermeticaat the beginning of his own treatise outlining his heliocentric theory.5 It wasappealed to, both in order to promote, and to argue against, the Enlightenment.6And of course, it was also appealed to for its profound doctrine of the spiritat one and the same time that alchemists invoked it in their quests to confectthe Philosophers’ Stone.7The Greeks who conquered Egypt had good reason to identify the Egyptian Thothwith their own Hermes, for Thoth was the quintessential “wisdom god,” or if oneprefers, the god who imparted the high sciences of divination, that is to say,astrology and astronomy, magic, and medicine.8 Similarly, the Greek Hermes was awisdom god “who crossed the border between gods and men, between this world andthe next”9 in a manner that recalls how mankind, in Bruno’s adaptation ofHermeticism, was viewed as a common surface or boundary condition between theworlds. In a manner recalling Marduk’s invisibility suit from the Babylonianepic the Enuma Elish, Hermes had a “Hades helmet” that rendered him invisible.10And of course, the Greek Hermes was the inventor of oratory and letters. For ourpurposes, it is also significant that the Greek Hermes was also the patron oftrade, finance, and commerce, and thus had a cult among merchants.11 In themilieu of post-Alexandrian Egypt, then, the two Gods—Thoth and Hermes—becamefused, as Alexander’s Macedonians and Greeks, sweeping across the ancient world,quickly concluded that the various pantheons of the cultures they conquered wereall identical in essence, differing only in their outward cultural form andnomenclature. This led, of course, to a conflation of the functions of the twogods as they amalgamated into the figure of “Hermes Trismegistus,” the “ThriceGreatest Hermes.”12 He was the god who lived among men and taught themphilosophy and theology, eventually inspiring—so the tradition ran—thephilosophers Democritus, Plato, and Pythagoras. In other words, the Hermetictradition claimed that it was Egypt, and not Greece, that was the origin ofphilosophy and the basis for science.It was precisely this conflation that led, very early on, to confusion over the“author” of the Hermetica, for as early as the third century B.C. the Egyptianpriest Manetho stated that there were in fact two Hermes, the ancient one, Thothhimself, who existed prior to the Deluge and who attempted to preserveantediluvian knowledge, and a subsequent Hermes, who, existing after the Flood,translated the works of the first Hermes into Greek.13 This highlights theproblem, for the ancient practice assigned less importance to “authorship” thanidentifying a series of concepts as belonging to a particular tradition and toits originator. Thus, anonymous authors could compose treatises embodyingHermetic doctrines, and because of this, would attribute “authorship” of such atreatise to “Hermes” as an act of honoring the inspiration behind the treatise.Thus could a body of literature grow and be attributed to “Hermes Trismegistus.”With this in mind, we now need to briefly examine the actual composition of thebody of works known as the Hermetica.It will have been noted that the claim of Hermeticism goes back to anantediluvian knowledge, that is, that the Hermetic texts contained an ancientwisdom, a primordial theology or prisca theologia, and this was to play acrucial role in the wide dissemination and influence of the Hermetica up untilthe late Renaissance. For example, Herodotus records that Pythagoras sojournedin Egypt, and, returning to Greece, taught the Greeks philosophy and themysteries.14 By the ninth century, the Muslim scholar Albuzar (787–886) notedthat the first Hermes, whom the Egyptians identified as Thoth, was the grandsonof Adam, and reckoned by the Hebrews to be Enoch, and whom the Muslims,following a tradition in the Koran, took to be the ancient prophet Idris. He,according to Albuzar, erected cities and pyramids in Egypt and warned of theimpending Flood, taking the precaution to inscribe all his knowledge on thewalls of the temple at Akhmin.15 Like Manetho, Albuzar maintained that thesecond Hermes lived after the Flood, and it was he, according to Albuzar, whoinstructed Pythagoras.162. The Works in the Corpus Hermeticum [Contents.html#rsec15]From the foregoing discussion, we may conclude that, without exception, thewritings of the Hermetica of Hermes Trismegistus are all pseudepigrapha, “fortheir alleged author did not write them.”17 But this also affords us aconvenient definition of what constitutes the Corpus Hermeticum, a definitionmoreover that is in keeping with ancient conceptions that attribute “authorship”to the assumed origin of the provenance of concepts embodied in a text. Thus, byHermetica we mean simply “all texts that refer explicitly to Hermes Trismegistusas their author” or which “are implicitly ascribed to him.”18 Even the greatNeoplatonic philosopher Iamblichus (ca. 245–345) admitted that the Hermeticbooks were not in fact written by Hermes Trismegistus but were rather“translations from the Egyptian by Greek speaking philosophers”19 who traced theorigin of their ideas back to Hermes.20 As most researchers are also aware, theCorpus Hermeticum is divided roughly into two distinct classes of texts, onehaving to deal with matters of philosophy and cosmology, and the other with“practical” matters concerning magic, astrology, divination, and, of course, thealchemical Philosophers’ Stone. We shall in this chapter concentrate almostexclusively on the philosophical texts.When using this definition, the philosophical component of the Corpus Hermeticummay be understood to be a collection of roughly seventeen texts,21 which werefirst circulated as a collection in the fourteenth century.22 Most of thesetexts are titled Libellus or Asclepius, followed by a number designating thespecific treatise in each series. We shall have occasion to examine some ofthese texts more directly later in this chapter.3. The Medicis, Ferrara-Florence, and Ficino [Contents.html#rsec16]While some texts of the Hermetica were certainly known to early Church fathersand writers such as Clement of Alexandria (ca. 150–215)—who returned a favorableverdict on them23—or Augustine of Hippo (354–430) who did not24—it was duringthe Renaissance that they truly exploded into significance, when Western Europerecovered original Greek manuscripts of some of the texts, and in this lies yetanother intriguing story.The story begins with a grand event, the reunion Council of Ferrara-Florence,held between 1438 and 1445 to reunify the Greek and Latin churches that hadsplit in 1054.25 It involves a rather obscure Italian scholar named Ficino, andthe very famous Italian banking family he worked for, the Medicis. FlorianEbeling comments on this constellation of relationships, and its significance,as follows: A widely believed legend is that Hermeticism, having vanished inthe Dark Ages along with the ancient world, remained hidden under the mantle ofChristian dogmatism until it was rediscovered in the Renaissance. In 1439 thecover was lifted when Cosimo de Medici relocated the great Council from Ferrarato Florence. The Greek scholars in attendance, including Bessarion and Plethon,so impressed the Florentine intellectuals, especially Cosimo, with theirknowledge of Greek antiquity, that they decided to create a home in Florence forthe ancient spirit, particularly Platonism. Some years later the head of theMedici family chose Marsilio Ficino to render Plato’s writings from Greek intoLatin. Then, in 1460 or thereabouts, one of Cosimo’s agents sent the texts ofthe Corpus Hermeticum to Florence. So while Ficino was still in the process oftranslating Plato, Cosimo unexpectedly asked him to render the texts of HermesTrismetistus. Ficino completed the first translation in 1463, a year beforeCosimo’s death, and with that began the renaissance of Hermeticism, which shapedthe intellectual history of the early modern period into the seventeenthcentury.26Note what we have here: 1) A prominent Florentine banking family—the Medicis—are sponsors of thereunion Council of Ferrara-Florence; 2) Prominent Byzantine humanists, Bessarion and Plethon, are among theGreek delegation in attendance; 3) After the Council, the Medicis somehow acquire the texts of the CorpusHermeticum; and finally, 4) Cosimo de Medici has Ficino immediately drop translation of Plato toconcentrate on translating the Hermetica.Why would a banking family such as the Medicis be interested in Platonism, andmore importantly, the Corpus Hermeticum? And how did these texts actually maketheir way to them?Once again, we may be looking at the possibility of hidden agendas in playduring the episode, for the Byzantine humanists Bessarion and Plethon wouldlikely have had some knowledge of the Hermetic texts, and with the Medicissponsoring a kind of revival of Plato’s academy in Florence, it would have beennatural for them to negotiate privately with these humanists for acquisition ofthe Hermetic texts.27 As we shall discover in chapter eight [Chapter008.html],there is other evidence that the West’s relationship with the Byzantine Empirewas for more than just Christian or political purposes, and there is moreevidence that some famous events of history may have been cover stories for theacquisition of hidden or lost knowledge. We shall address the question of why aprominent banking family should have been interested in such texts later in thischapter.In any case, Ficino’s translation activities for the Medicis included importanttranslations of the Neoplatonists Plotinus, Porphyry, and Iamblichus, inaddition to the Hermetica,28 and thus played a significant role in launching theRenaissance, as the new philosophical orientation not only challenged theAristotelianism of the Church, but also provided, as we saw in chapter one[Chapter001.html], the philosophical basis for the rise of modern science.In this respect, it is important to understand why Hermeticism so quicklycaptured the imagination of Renaissance intellectuals and magicians like Bruno.Ficino, in his construction of the genealogy of Hermes Trismegistus, followedthe tradition that the individual was a real person, and found so many numerousparallels between Hermes and Moses that the idea could be entertained that thevast body of texts came from ancient times, and that the two figures might beidentical.29 Indeed, in the Renaissance view, Moses was trained in all the artsand sciences of the Egyptians, including alchemy,30 and thus the ancient texts,including the Hermetica, were viewed as encoded information embodying lost highknowledge, the prisca theologia of high antiquity.31 In one text, the AuroraPhilosophorum or “Dawn of the Philosophers” (1577), the idea was ventured thatthis knowledge was passed down by Adam’s sons, and that it survived the Delugein Egypt, subsequently being passed by Moses to the ancient Hebrews.32 Persiaand Babylon, likewise, were viewed as Hermetic societies founded on the ancientwisdom,33 and even the Greek mythological figure of Prometheus was understood byFicino to be a “physicist.”34Succinctly put, the widespread tendency of the Renaissance was to take theHermetic texts at their word, and thus to ascribe the origins of their doctrinesto the knowledge and science of High Antiquity. The doctrines consequentlyspread rapidly.For example, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494), coming under theprotection of Lorenzo de Medici (1449–1492),35 in 1489 boldly published a seriesof nine hundred theses, ten of which referred to doctrines gleaned directly fromthe Hermetica. Six of these give strong hints as to why a family heavily engagedin banking activity would seek to extend its protection to the Hermeticist Pico: 1. Wherever there is life, there is soul. Wherever there is soul, thereis mind. 2. Everything moved is corporeal, everything moving incorporeal. 3. The soul is in the body, the mind is in the soul, the Word is in themind, and the Father of these is God. 4. God exists around all and through all things. The mind exists aroundthe soul, the soul around the air, the air around matter. 5. Nothing in the world is devoid of life. 6. Nothing in the universe can suffer death or destruction. Corollary:Life is everywhere, providence is everywhere, immortality is every-where.36Given this list and its contents, it is easy to see why a powerful bankingdynasty like the Medicis would be interested in promoting Hermeticism generally,and protecting Pico particularly. If one pursues the logical implications ofthese doctrines to their ultimate conclusions, as did Bruno, the necessity forCatholicism, or, for that matter, Protestantism, and their priestly or clericalelites and sacramental systems disappears. It is, in other words, a covert wayof challenging the power of the Roman Church, and gaining significant“maneuvering room” for the emerging financial-political classes of northernItaly.But why, then, would Bruno, clearly an avowed Hermeticist, incur the wrath ofthe other great banking power of northern Italy: Venice? As we shall see, theanswer lies in these very same doctrines. But before we can turn to aconsideration of this question, we must first understand why Hermeticism soabruptly declined a few years after Bruno’s martyrdom for the system.4. Isaac Casaubon and the End of Hermes Trismegistus [Contents.html#rsec17]It was a Franco-Swiss philologist, Isaac de Casaubon (1559–1614), who spelledthe end of the Corpus Hermeticum as a set of texts purportedly stemming fromHigh Antiquity. Born in Geneva to French Protestant refugees, Casauboneventually made his way to England, where he published the work that ended thecareer of Hermeticism, De Rebus Sacris et Ecclesiasticis, or “Of Things Holy andEcclesiastical,” in the year of his death, 1614.Just what did Casaubon do that was so destructive to the claims of theHermetica?Casaubon began by noting that there were parallelisms between passages of theHermetica and the canonical Gospels of Christianity. For example, he compared the passage, “If you do not first hateyour body, my son (Tat), you cannot love yourself” … to the passage in John12:25, “Those who love their life lose it; and those who hate their life in thisworld will keep it for eternal life.”37Additionally, Casaubon observed that the style of the Greek texts was not whatone should expect of pre-Christian writers, noting that many words in the GreekHermetica appeared only after the time of Christ.38 Additionally, Casaubonpointed out that the Platonic influences clearly evident in the texts meant thatthey could hardly have stemmed from a period earlier than Plato.39 HermesTrismegistus was a pseudepigraphal “imposter” who merely stole words ofScripture in order to convince pagans of the truth of Christian doctrine.40Furthermore, the fact that no pre-Christian ancient author ever mentioned, orquoted, from the Hermetica was another strong argument against itsauthenticity.41 The net result of Casaubon’s work, in effect, redated the entireCorpus Hermeticum to the early centuries of the Christian era.42With this redating came the shattering of Hermeticism’s own “legitimizationlegends,” ushering in the “horrible age” of Hermeticism, as it again wentunderground in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,43 surviving in thedoctrines of secret societies and fraternities. But it was no longer possible toview it as a primeval source of knowledge.44Consequently, it is fair to judge Casaubon’s work as signaling not only the endof Hermeticism as a body of knowledge claiming a descent from High Antiquity,but as the watershed work that spelled the end of the Renaissance, since the twowere so closely intertwined. Frances A. Yates, once again, squarely addressesthis point and all of its implications: Some discoveries of basic importance for the history of thoughtseem to pass relatively unnoticed. No one speaks of the “pre-Casaubon era” or ofthe “post-Casaubon era” and yet the dating by Isaac Casaubon in 1614 of theHermetic writings as not the work of a very ancient Egyptian priest but writtenin post-Christian times, is a watershed separating the Renaissance world fromthe modern world. It shattered at one blow the build-up of RenaissanceNeoplatonism with its basis in the prisci theologi of whom Hermes Trismegistuswas the chief … It shattered the position of an extremist Hermeticist, such asGiordano Bruno had been, whose whole platform of a return to a better “Egyptian”pre-Judaic and pre-Christian philosophy and magical religion was exploded by thediscovery that the writings of the holy ancient Egyptian must be dated, not onlylong after Moses but also long after Christ.45But it was not Casaubon, but Bruno and the Hermetica, that were to have the lastlaugh, as we shall now see.5. Epilogue: Modern Scholarship and the “End” of Isaac Casaubon[Contents.html#rsec18]In his argument that texts of the Hermetica seemed to parallel statements in thecanonical Christian Gospels, Casaubon was, of course, arguing for the priorityof the latter over the former. But he did not consider the possibility that theGospels themselves, and in particular that most “Hermetic” of the Gospels, thatof John, may have had Hermetic origins and influences, a possibility that modernscholarship has once again opened up.The problem with Casaubon’s analysis, as modern scholarship sees it, is that itmakes short shrift of the ancient conception of “authorship,” and indeed, shortshrift of the concepts embodied in the texts, concepts that do ultimately stemfrom ancient Egypt. Even Thoth, whom as we saw previously formed the partialbasis for the character of Hermes Trismegistus, was revered in Egypt, originallyas “twice great,” as early as the second millennium B.C.46 This was quicklyexpanded to “thrice great,” which of course “finally became ‘Trismegistus’ inthe Greek language.”47 And the modern discovery of many Hermetic texts in theNag Hammadi library in 1945 opened up once again the question of just how muchHermeticism was really Greek, or Egyptian, in origin.48 In this respect, asEbeling observes, the mention of Egyptian places and names in the Hermetica is“so striking that we cannot dismiss them as mere ‘decor,’ especially asparallels can be found in ancient Egyptian texts.”49Nor is this all.With the discovery of the Nag Hammadi texts in 1945, with their rich content ofGnostic and Hermetic texts, “the intellectual origins and context ofHermeticism” must be seen “in ever closer relationship to traditional Egyptianthought”50 according to the modern scholar Garth Fowden. One of the texts of theNag Hammadi library, The Ogdoad Reveals the Ennead, makes it clear thatHermeticism viewed the relationship between the master and the disciple as acomponent of a long tradition and succession,51 implying an origin earlier thanCasaubon’s dating, indeed an origin that ties the concepts to Egypt. It is thisidea of a succession, of a tradition of concepts, that gave rise toHermeticism’s understanding of its texts as “sacred,” but not in the sense of aspecial revelation.52 As we have already noted, with this idea of a succession,or tradition, “authorship” to the ancient mind meant primarily the ascription ofconcepts to their ultimate purported origin, in this case, to HermesTrismegistus, that is, to ancient Egypt.53The result of all these modern scholarly efforts is that “Egyptian thinking wasindisputably a major influence on the Hermetica.”54 The mere fact that manytexts of the Hermetica were written in Greek simply stems from the result of theGreek conquest of Egypt, such that any linkage of them to the Christian texts asCasaubon argued was not direct, but indirect, since both traditions stem from“the same blend of theological and philosophical speculation, drawn from variouscultures, including the Hellenic, Iranian, Judaic—and of course, theEgyptian—which were being explored at the time.”55 The dialogue form of thetexts, which superficially resemble the philosophical dialogues of the Greeks,themselves disclose an ultimately Egyptian provenance, for rather than beingdialogues between various philosophers, they are dialogues between master anddisciple, as is the case in standard Egyptian wisdom literature.56The result of these modern findings would have pleased Bruno, and displeasedCasaubon, for … now we’re back where we started. As was believed beforeCasaubon put the feline among the feathered creatures, the Hermetic books mayhave contained traditions, not to say secrets, from the old Egypt, the Egyptuntainted by the trendy Hellenic glamour of its occupiers.57There is also one final, and very significant, point that indicates an Egyptianorigin of the concepts of the Hermetica.This occurs in the Hermetic text known as the Asclepius, and here it is best tocite Fowden on this point: in answer to Aslcepius’ enquiry where these gods are atthe moment, Trismegistus replies (at Ascl. 27): ‘In a very great city, in themountain of Libya (in monte Libyco),’ by which is meant the edge of the desertplateau to the west of the Nile valley. A subsequent reference (Ascl. 37) to thetemple and tomb of Asclepius (Imhotep) in monte Libyae establishes that theallusion at Ascl. 27 is to the ancient and holy Memphite necropolis, which layon the desert jabal to the west of Memphis itself.58This suggestive coupling of “gods” with “mountains,” as readers of my book TheCosmic War: Interplanetary Warfare, Modern Physics, and Ancient Texts willrecognize, resembles the formula “mountains ≈ gods ≈ planets ≈ pyramids,” whichalso occurs in many other ancient texts,59 and is hardly Hellenic or Platonic inany sense.B. THE ANCIENT TOPOLOGICAL METAPHOR OF THE MEDIUM [Contents.html#rsec19]We are now at last in a position to examine the concepts of the Hermetica andhow they expressed the ancient Metaphor of the physical medium directly, and tosee why, initially, banking dynasties such as the Medicis would championHermeticism, and why, eventually, the banking colossus of Venice would see in arigorous Hermeticist like Giordano Bruno an explicit threat to its power.One might say that the essence of Hermeticism is that it brings the process ofreasoning by analogy to a very high pitch,60 indeed, to such a high pitch thatit only falls just short of doing so by means of a formal calculus of analogies.To understand why this is so, it is now time to explore the “Ancient TopologicalMetaphor of the physical Medium” in some depth, a metaphor which we alluded toin the first chapter. While I have written extensively of this metaphorelsewhere, here its implications are reviewed from yet a new perspective, thatof finance.1. Topological Preliminaries [Contents.html#rsec20]Let us begin with a simple thought experiment from mathematician GeorgeSpencer-Brown, and the cryptic remarks that open his masterpiece Laws of Form: Draw a distinction. Call it the first distinction. Call the space in which it is drawn the space severed orcloven by the distinction. Call the parts of the space shaped by the severance orcleft the sides of the distinction or, alternatively, the spaces, states, orcontents distinguished by the distinction. Let any mark, token, or sign be taken in any way with orwith regard to the distinction as a signal. Call the use of any signal its intent.61Now let us imagine that we envision an indescribable “No-thing,” as weenvisioned in the first chapter, utterly devoid of any distinguishing featureswhatsoever, infinitely “extended” in every “direction.” We might envision it asthe empty space in this box, except of course, our box has no neat linesdenoting its “edges”:[images/f0048-01.jpg]We have, in other words, an infinitely extended “No-thing” which, as we noted inthe first chapter, has a perfect mathematical symbol, the empty hyper-set,symbolized by Ø, to describe it, or as Spencer-Brown calls it, a mark or“signal” of intention.Now, within this space, we draw the simplest distinction: we cleave this space:[images/f0048-02.jpg]Remembering that our “box” really has no “edges,” what we really have is this:[images/f0048-03.jpg]In other words, we have two “spaces,” all that inside the circle, and alloutside of it, or, in other words, we have what Spencer-Brown calls a “clovenspace.” Note that the circle is a circumscription, a “writing around” or“peri-graphing,” which would be functionally symbolized by the paragraph symbol,¶, as a symbol of the function of “drawing a distinction” or “cleaving thespace.”Note two important things here: (1) we are dealing both with a “space” in theintellectual or conceptual sense, and (2) with a space in the real physicssense, at one and the same time. Additionally, because our original “box” isinfinite, the circle or cloven space within it itself has no limits, save thatthere is a boundary or “side” as Spencer-Brown calls it, a surface as thetopologists would say, between it and the space outside it. So we may assignsymbols or marks to each of the three things now distinguished: 1) the space outside the circle we will designate as the “interior” ofspace 1, with the interior denoted by the topological “o” superscript above thesignal or symbol Ø:[images/f0049-01.jpg] 2) and similarly the space inside the circle as space 2, another“interior”:[images/f0049-02.jpg] 3) and the common surface of the two, denoted by the partial derivativesymbol ∂:[images/f0049-03.jpg]Notice that what we now have, as a result of performing one act of distinction,are three “distinguished nothings.” We have created a metaphor of a “one-three,”a kind of primordial trinity. Notably, because our original Ø was dimensionlessor infinite, we cannot assign any real dimensionality to any of the entitiesthus distinguished either.62 Notice the all-important point that the signatureof Ø will always remain in the formal description of the regions or surfaces nomatter how many times the process is repeated. It remains in all contexts, andis thus a basis for analogical connections between all entities subsequentlygenerated by repetitions of this process. One might view this as a kind of“formally explicit calculus of inter-contextual analysis,” or, in short,analogical calculus.Now let us use this very abstract “topological metaphor” to examine itsexpression in various ancient cultures.2. In the Vedas [Contents.html#rsec21]Without a doubt, the earliest expression of this metaphor exists in the Vedictraditions of ancient India. For example, in the Padama Purana, it says this: In the beginning of creation the Great Vishnu, desirous ofcreating the whole world, became threefold: Creator, Preserver, Destroyer. Inorder to create this world, the Supreme Spirit produced from the right side ofhis body himself as Brahma then, in order to preserve the world, he producedfrom his left side Vishnu; and in order to destroy the world he produced fromthe middle of his body the eternal Shiva. Some worship Brahma, others Vishnu,other Shiva; but Vishnu, one yet threefold, creates, preserves, and destroys;therefore let the pious make do difference between the three.63There are several significant things going on in this passage.Firstly, note the metaphor once again is of Vishnu self-differentiating intothree entities: Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.But secondly, notice that the persons of Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva areassociated with the functions they perform Brahma creates; Vishnu preserves; and Shiva destroys.This association of persons with functions is one of the most crucial for ourpurposes, for it has enormous implications for the development of the doctrineof the corporate person in medieval Western Europe. For example, one finds adistant echo of this association in the “doctrine of appropriations” in thetrinitarian formulations of St. Augustine of Hippo. There, the persons are onceagain associated with the functions they most “appropriately” perform: The Father is principally the Creator; The Son is principally the Redeemer (note the language of transaction);and The Holy Spirit is principally the Sanctifier.This association of persons with functions inevitably devolves into thetemptation to reduce persons to functions, or sets of functions, to define themas such. This, as we shall see, is precisely the essential step in theelaboration of the doctrine of corporate personhood.However, there is much more to unpack from this significant passage. Note thatVishnu is also called, at the beginning of this process, the Supreme Spirit,that infinite No-Thing-ness that we have symbolized by the empty hyper-set, Ø.Once he has self-differentiated, he becomes Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, yet bythe topological symbolism we have employed to explore the metaphor, at the endof this process we have two interiors, Brahma and Shiva, Ø1 and Ø2 respectively,joined by a common surface, Vishnu, ∂Ø1,2. Why is Vishnu the common surface?Because in his functional description as preserver, he unites the oppositions ofBrahma (creator) and Shiva (destroyer). Thus, something important has happened:Vishnu is revealed as having contained, at the beginning of the process prior tohis self-differentiation, all functions. In short, Vishnu symbolizes Bruno’scoincidenta oppositorum, the coincidence of opposites. Vishnu becomes, as itwere, the binding relationship in his person of the other two persons, Brahmaand Shiva.Notice another significant thing that has happened here. At the beginning ofthis process, it is difficult to state whether Vishnu, as the Supreme Spirit, isa thing or a person, or to put it in more categorical terms, nature or person.But at the end of the process, the original Ø has differentiated itself intopersons described or associated with different functions:[images/f0051-01.jpg]In other words, in the Vedic version of the metaphor, the differentiation alsoresults in the creation of these categories: nature, functions, and persons,with the signature of Ø that remains in each of the above symbolizationsdenoting the fact that they all share the same common underlying nature, Ø. Toput this same point somewhat differently, in the initial stage of Ø prior todifferentiation, one cannot say whether Vishnu, as the Supreme Spirit, is merelya kind of impersonal nature or a person. Indeed, in the unfolding of themetaphor, it is both at the same time. This will have important implications aswe shall see. Also bear in mind Vishnu’s role here as a common surface orrelationship between the other two will be quite crucial when we turn to aconsideration of its use as a metaphor of money, as we shall see below.64a. The Vedic Version of the Metaphor, and Sacrifice [Contents.html#rsec22]We now approach the Vedic version of this ancient metaphor from a completelydifferent point of view, and in doing so, we also approach the connection of themetaphor to the notions of sacrifice and debt. If one looks at the Vedic versionas outlined previously, it is possible to view Vishnu—as the Supreme Spirit whodifferentiates himself—as dismembering himself, that is to say, as “sacrificing”himself in order to bring about creation.65 As differentiations proceed fromVishnu, Brahma, and Shiva, creating ever more and more gods anddifferentiations, thus the whole process of continuous differentiation is alsothe process of continuous dismemberment and sacrifice.This is, in fact, what one school of Vedic thought did, for it is this sacrificewhich is the founding act of creation: It is the Sacrifice which is “the center of the Earth,” forthrough the Sacrifice “the gods performed it … and through it all these powersreach the center … of heaven where the first performers … , the gods, are.” Thedifferent images of perception, either as confused or non-differentiated … ordifferentiated … all end up in the Sacrifice—through decapitation,dismemberment, interaction, or as the sensorium synthesis.66In other words, the metaphor here, as always, has a “both/and” character, beingnow a metaphor of overflowing fecundity and plenitude, and of the absence ofdebt, and now a metaphor of the indebtedness of creation to the “sacrifice” and“dismemberment” which brought it about, leading, as the above quotationillustrates, to two very different ways for the creature to approach the gods,or God, namely, either through the intellectual ascent of the “sensoriumsynthesis” or through sacrifice: “This returning to the original infinite space. . . is no longer the return to inaction, but rather the result of action, anaction leading to that illumined instant-moment of light . . . where the ‘Fatherand Mother meet … ’”67 that is, where the oppositions once again coincide, here,in the coincidence of androgyny.But Hinduism, during the Brahmist phase, also pursued not only the implicationof the principle of the fecundity of the metaphor and of a return or union withGod or the gods through the intellectual sensorium synthesis, but also construedthe metaphor in its sense of the generation of the infinite indebtedness ofcreation to the gods and their sacrifice. It is quite crucial to note that thisnotion of sacrifice, of indebtedness, does not follow logically from themetaphor when understood in its bare, topological nakedness, i.e., whenunderstood in the most sophisticated mathematical fashion, but only does so whenthe metaphor degenerates from a mathematical expression to a religious one. Inother words, while there is no logical connection between “differentiation” and“sacrifice,” the two became equated and identified once the metaphor was statedin religious and metaphysical “financial” language. Once so construed, however,it forms the ultimate basis for the long association of the temples of highfinance with the temples of religion, and every effort is bent to prevent theexploration of the metaphor in terms of its inherent principle of fecundity andplenitude.This is quite the crucial point, for if, as I have argued elsewhere, thesocieties of the Indus Valley, Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, and so on, are thelegacies of an ancient Very High Civilization from High Antiquity, possessed ofadvanced science and technologies, then the degeneration of the metaphor from atopological one to a religio-financial one represents, in one sense, not merelya change in the terms by which the metaphor is expressed and symbolized, but aprofound misunderstanding of the metaphor in its original mathematical intent.To put it even more succinctly, the likelihood is that the earliest sense of themetaphor was based solely on the principle of fecundity and plenitude, not ofsacrifice and indebtedness.This has two implications. As can be seen, the very nature of the metaphor isanalogical, since the signature of Ø remains across all distinct contexts.Consequently, one may approach the reascent to “the gods” via the practice ofthe analogical imagination, and even of sympathetic, or better put, “analogical”magic, to gain influence and power over “the gods,” as we saw with Bruno. On theother hand, in the twisted version of the metaphor, one may also seek to gaincontrol or influence over the gods—to “appease” the gods—through the practice ofbloody sacrifice. As we shall see when we return to a consideration of theHermetic expression of this metaphor, and to a consideration of Bruno’semployment of it, this point has profound implications.Consequently, the metaphor became twisted into a language—and into the actualpractice—of sacrifice and indebtedness, and once it did, it began to empower apriestly elite authorized to perform sacrifices, or, alternatively, magicalrituals. Significantly, the earliest Vedic literature, dating from 1500 to 1200BC, “evince a concern with debt—which is treated as synonymous with guilt andsin.”68 For these texts, stemming from the Brahman period, human existence “isitself a form of debt.”69 For example, in the Satapatha Brahmana 3.6.2.16, thisunderstanding of the metaphor is stated explicitly: A man, being born, is a debt; by his own self he is born toDeath, and only when he sacrifices does he redeem himself from death.70The consequences of this view are enormous, according to French economictheorist Bruno Théret: At the origin of money we have a “relation of representation” ofdeath as an invisible world, before and beyond life—a representation that is theproduct of the symbolic function proper to the human species and which envisagesbirth as an original debt incurred by all men, a debt owing to the cosmic powersfrom which humanity emerged. Payment of this debt, which can however never be settledon earth—because its full reimbursement is out of reach—takes the form ofsacrifices which, by replenishing the credit of the living, make it possible toprolong life and even in certain cases to achieve eternity by joining the Gods.But this initial belief-claim is also associated with the emergence of sovereignpowers whose legitimacy resides in their ability to represent the entireoriginal cosmos. And it is these powers that invented money as a means ofsettling debts—a means whose abstraction makes it possible to resolve thesacrificial paradox by which putting to death becomes the permanent means ofprotecting life.71But this can only be true, as we have seen, if one misconstrues the metaphorfrom its deepest mathematical sense—emphasizing the principle of plenitude andthe creation of information via ever more differentiations—to the metaphor ofindebtedness and sacrifice. For as we shall now discover, the metaphor, in itsexplicit Hermetic version, contains some very significant clues that suggestprofound and deep reasons why Bruno was such a threat to the religious andfinancial powers of his day.3. The Metaphor in the Hermetic Tradition [Contents.html#rsec23]There is a passage in the Hermetica that succinctly embodies the metaphor, andwhich does so in linguistic terms that unite theology, philosophy, and cosmologyvery tightly: Of what magnitude must be that space in which the Kosmos ismoved? And of what nature? Must not that Space be far greater, that it may beable to contain the continuous motion of the Kosmos, and that the thing movedmay not be cramped for want of room, and cease to move?—Ascl. Great indeed mustbe that Space, Trismegistus.—Herm. And of what nature must it be Aslcepius? Mustit not be of opposite nature to Kosmos? And of opposite nature to the body isthe incorporeal . . . Space is an object of thought, but not in the same sensethat God is, for God is an object of thought primarily to Himself, but Space isan object of thought to us, not to itself.72Notice once again that we have the presence of a primordial Trinity, only thistime it is not that of Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva, nor even the Christian Father,Son, and Holy Spirit, or the Neoplatonic One, Intellect, and World Soul, butGod, Space, and Kosmos [images/f0055-01.jpg][images/f0055-01.jpg]. Note alsothat, with the exception of the term God, the other two enumerated entities arethings, not persons.But like the Vedic version of the metaphor, each of these three entities aredistinguished by a dialectic of opposition based on three elemental functions,each of which in turn implies its own functional opposite:[images/f0055-02.jpg]As I have pointed out in previous books, each of these three entities—God,Space, and Kosmos—may thus be described as a set of functions or theiropposites:73[images/f0056-01.jpg]In this version of the metaphor, it is space that becomes the common surface ofthe other two entities, since it comprises functional elements—as noted in thetable above—of the other two entities. So, once again, we have our familiarthree topological entities: 1) The “bracketed” region of nothing, or Ø1,, Hermes’ “Kosmos”; 2) The rest of the nothing, or Ø2, Hermes’ “God”; and, 3) The “surface” that the two regions share, or ∂Ø1.2, Hermes’ “Space.”But this is not all there is to the Hermetic version of the metaphor.In the Libellus II, there occurs a short, but very significant, exchange betweenHermes and his disciple Asclepius: Hermes: Now what was it that we said of that Space in which theuniverse is moved? We said, Asclepius, that it is incorporeal. Asclepius: What then is that incorporeal thing? Hermes: It is mind, entire and wholly self-encompassing, freefrom the erratic movement of things corporeal …74In other words, in the Hermetic version of the metaphor, there is a directinterface between mind and space, or mind and the physical medium.But there is more.The Hermetica state quite explicitly that its understanding of the metaphor isalmost exclusively based on the principle of fecundity, of plenitude; there isin such passages almost a complete absence of any language of the notion ofsacrifice and primordial debt: Matter, though it is manifestly ungenerated, yet has in itselffrom the first the power of generating; for an original fecundity is inherent inthe properties of matter, which possesses in itself the power of conceivingthings and giving birth to them. Matter then is generative by itself, withoutthe help of anything else … … Thus the space in which is contained the universe withall things that are therein is manifestly ungenerated … For the existence of allthings that are would have been impossible, if space had not existed as anantecedent condition of their being.75Observe that matter and space are both conceived in almost the same terms, as aningenerate but creative principle, almost as if the Hermetica was anticipatingmodern physics theories of the energy of vacuum space, the zero point energy.And this matter-space, as we have seen, is also Mind.The Hermetica make one last association to this complex of Space-Matter-Mind,and that is man himself, who, as the boundary condition or common surface ofsoul and matter, is the microcosm of the whole creative process at large in theUniverse, which as we saw in chapter one [Chapter001.html] is viewed as a “greatman,” and more besides: … (That) is why man, unlike all other living creatures upon theearth, is twofold. He is mortal by reason of his body; he is immortal by reasonof the Man of eternal substance.76Thus this Man of eternal substance is, so to speak, not only the “commonsurface” of Space-Mind and Matter, but is also a co-creator with God of theentire creation,77 and thus, as a co-creator with God, is thus also to someextent God and therefore not indebted to some external power. For those who areaware of it, this is but another expression of what modern physics would callthe Participatory and Final Anthropic Principles, which may be formulated as thefollowing two statements of principle respectively: 1) “Observers are necessary to bring the Universe into being.”78 2) “Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in theUniverse, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.”79As Bruno put it, Yahweh “represents each one of us.” Hermeticism, by embodyingthe metaphor in metaphysical categories most closely approximating thetopological properties of the metaphor, thus knows no version of debt orsacrifice—or priestly elites empowered to perform them—and thus, if translatedinto financial and monetary terms, it is supremely a metaphor of debt-freeproduction and creativity, of debt-free money.Pause now and consider carefully the threat that Hermeticism posed, particularlyin the rigorous form that Bruno advocated it, both to the Papacy and to Venice,that is, to the religious and financial powers: 1) On the one hand, by claiming to stem from Hermes Trismegistus, aprovenance more ancient than Moses, the Hermetica was also claiming to be basedon a hidden tradition of knowledge older than the Yahwist revelation on whichthe power of the Papacy rested. 2) On the other hand, by framing the metaphor in terms devoid ofsacrifice and debt, and in which man himself is both eternal and a co-creatorwith God, Hermeticism struck another blow at the emerging debt-money bankingsystems that had begun to emerge in northern Italy in the late Middle Ages, andalso at the very sacramental-sacrificial system of the Roman Church.80As the scholar and anthropologist David Graeber puts this point, theories ofprimordial debt, or versions of the Metaphor which stress the sacrifice-debtinterpretation of creation, “always end up becoming ways of justifying—or layingclaim to—structures of authority.”81 Indeed, in the primordial topologicalversion, the metaphor is not one of debt at all: Even if it is possible to imagine ourselves as standing in aposition of absolute debt to the cosmos, or to humanity, the next questionbecomes: Who exactly has a right to speak for the cosmos, or humanity, to tellus how that debt must be repaid?82That, indeed, is the rub, for in the Hermetic version of the Metaphor, everyhuman being is a manifestation of that “eternal Man,” and thus no one individualor institution is in a privileged position to speak for it.4. Giordano Bruno and Other Renaissance Thinkers [Contents.html#rsec24]We return then to a deeper consideration of Giordano Bruno and his place withinthis vast constellation of concepts of God, space, the medium, Mind, and money.It may safely be said that the problem of the relationship of an infinite spaceand an infinite deity was the key question engaging not only late medievaltheology and philosophy, but science as well.83 As philosophers and theologiansalike noted, both God and Space were described by similar terms, such as “One,Simple, Immobile, Eternal Complete, Independent, Existing in Itself, Subsistingby itself, Incorruptible, Necessary, Immense, Uncreated, Uncircumscribed,Incomprehensible, Omnipresent, Incorporeal, All-penetrating, All-embracing,Being by its Essence, Actual Being, Pure Act,” and so on.84 Because of thisfact, many Hermeticists came to identify Space, Mind, and God. The fact thatmuch western medieval theology and philosophy proceeded within a basicAristotelian framework of a closed system made this question even more crucialonce the Platonic, Neoplatonic, and Hermetic traditions reemerged in thefifteenth century.Bruno, following his own Renaissance version of modern physics’ “multiuniverse”theories, derived the idea that God created all possible worlds from theHermetic tradition’s interpretation of the principle of plenitude of theMetaphor.85 Bruno, in short, rigorously applied the plenitude principle.86Following the Hermetic principles surveyed above, Bruno deduced fifteenproperties of space, among which there is one that is both a direct blow atAristotle, and at the Church’s teaching that God alone is pre-existent andeternal: Space is neither a substance nor an accident because things arenot made from it nor is it in things. Rather, space is that in which things arelocally. It is a nature that exists “before the things located in it, with thethings located in it, and after the things located in it.”87By removing space from Aristotle’s categories of substance and accident,88 Brunois in effect saying that space—whose identity with Mind, and with the principleof fecundity we have already noted in the Hermetica—is that primordial“No-thing” from which all else is derived.89Moreover, this space is for Bruno’s contemporary and compatriot and fellowHermeticist, Tommaso Campanella (1568–1639), a space with specific mathematicalproperties (as one would expect from the influence of Hermeticism upon him, andwith Hermeticism’s strongly topological flavoring of the Metaphor). It was thismathematical property that allowed it to be linked directly to Mind and mentalprocesses.90 It was, literally, for so many Hermeticists of the day—Campanellaincluded—a potency for the forms of the mind.91For Bruno, Space became a kind of ultra-fine matter from which everything elsewas created, whereas for another contemporary and Italian RenaissanceHermeticist, Francesco Patrizi (1529–1597), Space was filled with light, thusmaking it appear that between the two men—Bruno and Patrizi—yet another modernphysics conception, the wave-particle duality, was anticipated during theRenaissance.Given all this, it is clear that Bruno—and others—were explicitly dealingphilosophical death-blows to the closed religio-philosophical system of themedieval Church.C. THE RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, AND FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE HERMETIC VERSIONOF THE METAPHOR [Contents.html#rsec25]We are at last in a position to understand the full political, religious, andfinancial ramifications of the metaphor, and in stating these ramifications, onemay easily perceive why a rigorous Hermeticist like Bruno posed such a threat tothe religious, political, and financial powers of Venice and the Vatican:1. Political and Religious Implications of the Coincidenta Oppositorum[Contents.html#rsec26]It has already been noted that Bruno was accused of being an atheist in Britain,but yet was warmly welcomed (for a time at least) in Lutheran Germany, implyinghis views carried some theistic weight in that country. The reason for this liesin the peculiarity of the Metaphor itself, which, as we have seen, implies theconjunction of opposites,92 a point which, as we saw in Chapter One[Chapter001.html], Bruno stated quite clearly. And one of the most difficultaspects of this conjunction is that the Metaphor may be construed in both anatheistic and theistic sense.a. The Atheistic and Theistic Interpretations [Contents.html#rsec27]If one looks closely at the Metaphor in its topological expression, itconstitutes a kind of “First Event” or “Primordial Happening.” This implies bothan atheistic and theistic understanding: … for if analyzed carefully, it is both an act that is supremelyirrational and random on the one hand, and supremely rational and non-random onthe other, and in that, various people at various times have construed it now inan atheistic sense, and in a theistic sense, and that is the point: it can, andto a certain extent, must be construed as both. Let us look at the “irrationaland random” side of it first. Since it is the First Event, it is truly random andirrational as no subsequent events deriving from it can be; there is no priorexplanation for it, there are no temporal or physical or metaphysical categoriesthat can be applied to it. In the metaphor of “differentiated nothings derivingfrom a primordial nothing,” one may simply replace the word “nothing” as atranslation of Ø with the word “randomness,” to see that every subsequent eventbecomes suffused with a condition of randomness, since the signature of thatFirst Randomness, Ø, always remains as a part of its formal topologicaldescription. We are bold to suggest that it is for this precise reason that manyscientists and physicists view the world in “atheistic” terms, as a series ofrandom events and the ability of systems to “self-organize,” for that is oneimplication of the metaphor. It is truly random, in other words, because thereare no other Events with which it may be compared and statistically modeled; itis the Event from which all events stem. But, at the same time once again, one cannot imagine anysuch First Event as occurring without an act of Consciousness to draw thedistinction or cleavage in the original space to begin with; one, after all,imagines it, and that is a supreme act of a reasoning consciousness. The FirstEvent, therefore, is also a supremely non-random and rational event at one andthe same time as it is a supremely random and irrational one. To put this pointin terms that would be understood by an ancient metaphysician, being isbecoming. This stresses yet another “both/and” characteristic of the Metaphor,for that Primordial Happening stands both inside of, and outside of, time. Itstands inside of time in the sense that, in its mathematical description, achange in the state of the system has occurred between Ø and the three resultantversions of Ø that arise after it is cloven: ØA, ØB, and ∂ØA,B. Yet, that firstprimordial “trinity” stands outside of time as well, since the First Eventleading to their rise occurs in the primordial Nothing or Ø to begin with, andin that Ø, the absence of distinctions means that there is an absence of time.93By adhering rigorously to the Hermetic version of the Metaphor, Bruno wastherefore bound to be interpreted by his contemporaries as either a theist, or,as he was accused in England, an atheist, when in fact by the Hermetic nature ofthe case he was both.But there is another implication, one that lies hidden in the Hermeticassociation of God, Space, Mind, and “the eternal Man” acting as the commonsurface of all, and it is one that hovers over the whole Hermetic enterprise,suffusing itself throughout the implications of Bruno’s writings, and that isthe moral conjunction of the opposites of good and evil. By maintaining that“Yahweh represents or symbolizes us,” Bruno was in fact saying that humanity andhuman intentions, for good or ill, had a kind of group-multiplier effect on theMedium, on God, and hence, that the way to banish ultimate evil was literally bythe expulsion of vices—murders, lusts, greed—the expulsion of the TriumphantBeast from within each individual person. That is to say, for the rigorousHermeticisim of Bruno, the problem of theodicy, of good and evil, lay within manhimself, and so did its solution.b. The Impersonal and Personal Interpretations [Contents.html#rsec28]This same both/and quality of the Metaphor also leads to a second implication,namely, that in its original stage, prior to differentiation, it may beconstrued in both an impersonal and in a personal sense, as we saw with theVedic version. Here too, Bruno criticized the Yahwist revelation, “with itsemphasis on a personal God” as destroying “the concept of the Deity as immanentprinciple, embodied in the natural religion of the Egyptians.”94 Yet, Brunocould, and did, speak of his immanent Deity in very personal terms. Again, inthis Bruno was adhering rigorously to the both/and dialectical nature of theHermetic version of the Metaphor.2. Financial Implications [Contents.html#rsec29]While we have already noted that the Hermetic version of the Metaphor speaksseldom, if at all, of the idea of sacrifice and debt, but is based on the pure“topology” of the creation of information in the principle of plenitude, it isworth noting here once again that the financial implication is that moneybecomes a kind of alchemy of creativity and production, a measure of it. Debt,and with it, empowered debt-elites, do not enter the picture. While we mustinevitably address this question of money, debt, sacrifice, and the Metaphor inmore depth in the coming pages, it is worth noting that, just as in theHermetica, one likewise searches in vain in Bruno for the notion that man owes adebt to God or the universe. Small wonder, then, that Venice was complicit inhis holocaust. Bruno’s philosophical-Hermetic magic was indeed threatening tothe whole financial religious system as it had emerged in the High Middle Agesand existed in his own day.It is therefore to Venice, the other side in this grisly transaction, that wenow turn.________________________1 Giordano Bruno, The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast, First Dialogue,First Part, p. 91.2 Florian Ebeling, The Secret History of Hermes Trismegistus: Hermeticismfrom Ancient to Modern Times, trans. from the German by David Lorton (Ithaca,NY: Cornell University Press, 2007), p. 3.3 Ibid., p. 2.4 Ibid.5 Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince, The Forbidden Universe: The OccultOrigins of Science and the Search for the Mind of God (New York: SkyhorsePublishing, 2011), pp. 31–32.6 Ebeling, The Secret History of Hermes Trismegistus, p. 2.7 Ibid.8 Ibid., p. 4.9 Ibid., p. 5.10 For Marduk’s invisibility suit, see my The Giza Death Star Destroyed(Kempton, IL: Adventures Unlimited Press, 2005), pp. 42–43.

For him, the Venetian system of merchant banking,mercenary military, and empire is a kind of quintessential icon or font of allthe evils associated with predatory banking oligarchies and the inevitableempires and wars they spawn. But surely, one might argue, he is overstating hiscase? Surely the idea of a fifteen-centuries-long oligarchical conspiracy goingback to Babylon is stretching the case? Surely Tarpley overstresses the role ofVenice and ignores the role of the other Italian city-states and their ownmerchant bankers? After all, one need only think of Genoa or Padua, andparticularly of Florence, home to the Bardi, Peruzzi, and Medici banking andmerchant families. More to the point, surely it taxes the imagination to assumethat mighty Venice would bend every effort to bring the errant Hermeticist Brunoto heel and ruin?Well might Tarpley have complained of Venice, however, for understanding thestructure of its tangled history in European politics, much less therelationship of that history to its political and financial institutions, andthen to couple all that to Giordano Bruno, Hermeticism, hidden mathematicalmetaphors and their scientific and financial implications, and to weave it allinto a complex architecture of conspiracy, is like entering a haunted fun house,with progressively more abnormal rooms full of moldering dust and cobwebbedlibrary shelves of ancient manuscripts, where staircases lead to bricked-upwalls, where doorways open upon sudden plunges into chasms, where trapdoors aresprung over spiked pits, where the ceilings in rooms are either awkwardly low ordizzyingly high, where one’s own voice echoes in the musty gloom.One might be tempted to argue Tarpley’s case on the basis of heraldry, pointingout that Venice’s standard was a red flag, boldly emblazoned with a winged lion,and pointing out its similarity to the winged lions of Babylon and Assyria:[images/f0066-01.jpg]The Flag of the Venetian Republic. Note the Babylonian Winged Lion.[images/f0067-01.jpg]Winged Lion with Human Head, from Assyrian King Ashurbanipal’s PalaceIt is easy to identify the winged lion as the emblem of St. Mark, the patron ofVenice, and indeed, the Venetian Republic spared no effort to acquire St. Mark’srelics from Alexandria, Egypt.3 But one can make something of a deeperhistorical case that the connection is indeed Mesopotamian in its ultimateroots, an argument in which the strange appearance of winged Mesopotamian lionson Venice’s official flag makes contextual sense.A.

His work, An Economic History of Rome, as I noted in thatbook, “became such a standard in the field that it became the basis for entriesin the Cambridge Ancient History and the Oxford History of Rome.”5 WhatProfessor Frank discovered is as startling now as it was in his own day, forwhat he found was that “during the period between the Republic and the finalemergence of the empire,” the population of Roman Italy was by and large “notRoman or Latin at all, but—in a word and without much exaggeration—Babylonian.”6Frank came to this conclusion by noting a widespread use of both Greek propernames and surnames on various inscriptions and documents, such that between 300BC and 300 AD the Roman population underwent such a drastic change that it wasno longer Latin at all.7But the Greek names were themselves confusing, for as we saw in the previouschapter, Alexander the Great’s conquest of the ancient world from Persia toEgypt spread the Greek language as a lingua franca across many diversecultures.8 So who were these people?As I noted in Babylon’s Banksters, Professor Frank’s way of answering thisquestion was “to take Rome’s classical authors and satirists at their word, andfrom this an important and very significant fact emerges.”9 Just what did Rome’sclassical authors and satirists say? Frank notes that the satirist Juvenalcomplained “that the Tiber had captured the waters of the Syrian Orantes.”10 Hegoes on to state: When Tacitus informs us that in Nero’s day a great many of Rome’ssenators and knights were descendants of slaves and that the native stock haddwindled to surprisingly small proportions, we are not sure whether we are notto take it as an exaggerated thrust by an indignant Roman of the old stock … Todiscover some new light upon these fundamental questions of Roman history, Ihave tried to gather such fragmentary data as the corpus of inscriptions mightafford. The evidence is never decisive in its purport, and it is always, by thevery nature of the material, partial in its scope, but at any rate it may helpus to interpret our literary sources to some extent. It has at least convincedme that Juvenal and Tacitus were not exaggerating. It is probably that whenthese men wrote a very small percentage of the free plebeians on the streets ofRome could prove unmixed Italian descent. By far the larger part, perhaps ninetypercent, had Oriental blood in their veins.11As I put it in Babylon’s Banksters, One has only to read a bit between the lines to see whatProfessor Frank is implying, for Juvenal, let it be recalled, had complained ofthe Syrian “Orantes” river “flowing into the Tiber,” a metaphor for people ofChaldean—i.e., Babylonian—extraction having “flowed” into the bloodlines of theancient Roman stock: “These dregs call themselves Greeks,” he complains, “buthow small a portion is from Greece; the River Orantes has long flowed into theTiber.” The basic historical outlines are now clear, for as theRoman conquests spread into the eastern Mediterranean and eventually conqueredthe old Seleucid Empire—i.e., the portion of Alexander’s empire based inMesopotamia with its capital at Babylon - many of these people made their wayback to the Italian peninsula as slaves, and, following the relatively lenientRoman custom of manumission of slaves upon the death of their owner, these laterbecame the freemen and the backbone of the Roman economy in the very lap of theEmpire itself.12The implications are enormous, for not only did these slaves bring with themtheir religion and culture—a point that would explain the increasing“orientalization” of the Roman imperium—but they also brought with them “their‘Babylonian’ business and banking practices.”13 And of course, when Attila theHun ravaged the peninsula and threatened even Rome itself, many of thesemercantile families fled to northern Italy. It is here that we find, then, theconnection between ancient Babylon’s “bullion brokers,” Rome, and the laterItalian city-states, with their banking oligarchies.14There is another odd connection between Venice and ancient Mesopotamia.Researcher Webster Griffin Tarpley, whom we cited in the epigraphs to thischapter, remarked that “Early on, Venice became the location of a Benedictinemonastery on the island of St. George Major. St. George is not a Christiansaint, but rather a disguise for Apollo, Perseus, and Marduk, idols of theoligarchy.”15 To see the connection to ancient Mesopotamia and Marduk, one needonly recall that the iconographic portrayal of St. George is typically that ofhim seated on a horse, spearing a fearsome dragon. With that in mind,contemplate the following images that I first depicted in Genes, Giants,Monsters, and Men:[images/f0070-01.jpg]Assyrian King Ashurbanipal Slaying the Lion[images/f0070-02.jpg]Ninurta’s Thunderbolt Slaying the DragonTarpley’s point is that the symbolism of St. George, like the symbolism ofVenice’s winged lion, originates with Babylonia.16So with this context in mind, let us look more closely at Venice, for it willafford the port of entry into a wider consideration of Italian banking duringthe late Middle Ages and Renaissance.B. A BRIEF HISTORY OF VENICE [Contents.html#rsec31]Obviously, any attempt to recount the history of the Most Serene Republic ofVenice in a mere chapter is doomed to failure. One can only highlight certainimportant features of that history for their importance to our story here. Thosefeatures have a great deal to do with how hidden knowledge possibly came to lateMedieval and Renaissance Italy, and as we shall see, with the execution ofBruno. Additionally, in our cursory exposition of the mechanisms of the Venetianstate in this and subsequent chapters, we shall also discover how and why Brunowas such a potential threat to the Venetian state and economy.1. Foggy Beginnings in a Swamp [Contents.html#rsec32]Venice’s beginnings are literally shrouded in the fog of the swampy lagoon inwhich the city was raised. During the barbarian invasions of the Western RomanEmpire, many families fled northward on the Italian peninsula, some to settlethe towns on the lagoon that would eventually become Venice.17 Why would such aninhospitable swamp be chosen for the base of new settlements? Here Venetiantradition differs somewhat from reality, for the reality is that the lagoonsimply afforded a defensive position. The lagoon, in short, was founded onfear.18 In any case, after Alaric sacked Rome in 410, Venetian tradition heldthat the city was founded exactly at noon of Friday, March 25, in the year411.19Without land for agriculture, with no visible means of support, no access tocommodities of any kind, this location meant that the population of the lagoonturned almost immediately to the sea, and to trade, as the foundation for theircommonwealth.20 The financial security and empire of Venice that emerged fromthis circumstance might be said to be the world’s “first virtual economy,”21based on a fragile balance of trade in bullion, slaves, both finished andunfinished commodities, and spices. And because of this peculiar circumstance,Venice “lived in perpetual fear that, if its trade routes were severed, thewhole magnificent edifice might simply collapse.”22 Thus any threat, whethergeopolitical, military, or a cosmological system, was inevitably perceived bythe Venetians as a threat to their whole way of life. Indeed, the necessity oftrade made Venice, in a certain sense, the first truly modern secular state,with trade conducted on an “amoral” basis free of religious or dogmaticconsiderations. Venice assumed the right “to buy and sell anything to anyone,”23an attitude that would eventually lead to a backlash. Even Byzantium wouldcomplain, in the ninth century, of Venice’s sale of war materials consisting inpart of metals, and slaves for the Cairo Sultan’s army.242. The Influence of the East Roman, or Byzantine, Empire [Contents.html#rsec33]A visitor to Venice, whether in ancient times or modern ones, would be struck bythe fact that, almost entirely alone of all major Western European cities,Venice has a uniquely Byzantine look and feel to it, demonstrated especially bythe domed church of San Marco with its Greek style-iconography and pageantry. Itis this Byzantine influence that forms a second crucial component of the matrixof the Venetian Empire, and its “oriental” or eastward orientation. The VenetianEmpire in fact begins with the re-conquest of the Western provinces—the Italianpeninsula particularly—under the Roman Emperor in Constantinople, Justinian I(reigned 527–565) and his military genius, the general Belisarius.25 Venice, forits part, aided in this re-conquest with ships to blockade the provincialcapital of Ravenna, and shortly afterward, Venetian ambassadors went toConstantinople and returned with the first of many agreements between Venice andthe Empire that accorded the city military protection, but more importantly,unique trading privileges throughout the East Roman Empire.26 Venice was, as aresult of these arrangements, for all intents and purposes an autonomousself-governing city within the Empire, uniquely positioned to dominate theAdriatic Sea and, as will be seen, eventually the rich trading routes flowingfrom China and India through the Middle East and into the Eastern Mediterranean.Indeed, Venice and Byzantium possessed a “special relationship” rather similarto that of Great Britain and the United States, with the status and powerbetween the two changing, as the Byzantine Empire gradually declined through thecenturies, and the power of Venice grew. Yet the special relationship alwaysremained, and was even symbolized when one of the early Doges (Dukes) of Venicewas granted “the imperial title of Hypatos, or Consul … ”27 By the early ninthcentury, Venice, while still nominally a province of the Eastern Empire, was forall intentions and purposes entirely autonomous and self-governing, a situationthat the Eastern Empire was fully willing to accept, since Venetian tradebenefitted it.For the Venetians, it was equally important to obtain recognition of that statusfrom the Empire of Charlemagne. This came through the peculiar circumstance of apalace coup in Constantinople, when in 811 the two Empires signed a treaty inwhich the Eastern Empire recognized the Western Emperor’s title, and the WesternEmpire formally renounced any claims over the territory of Venice.28 Thebenefits to Venice of this treaty were huge, for it allowed her to “enjoy allthe advantages, partly political but above all cultural and commercial, of beinga Byzantine province, without any real diminution of her independence.”29 It wasthis Byzantine connection, solidified and recognized by both the Holy RomanEmpire of the West and the East Roman Empire of Constantinople, which allowedVenice to maintain its Byzantine ties, and thus to remain “virtually untouchedby the feudal system”30 that would emerge in the rest of Medieval WesternEurope. This tie was further solidified in a cultural and spiritual fashion whenVenetian traders literally stole the body of St. Mark from Muslim Egypt andreturned it to Venice, where he would become the patron of the city. Venice wasnow, literally, an “apostolic see” by dint of its possession of the relics of anearly disciple and apostle, a fact that would more often than not induce Veniceto a course of spiritual independence in defiance of the papacy, as we shallsee.31a. The “Golden Bull” of 1082 [Contents.html#rsec34]The next major step in the “Byzantinization” of Venice and the cementing of the“special relationship” between it and the East Roman Empire came with theso-called Golden Bull of 1082. After the “terrible day” of the Battle ofManzikert on August 26, 1071 and the decisive defeat of the Byzantine armies bythe Turks, the Empire entered its long and inevitable period of decline, withVenice increasingly being called upon to lend its growing naval and militarypower to the defense of the Empire and indeed Constantinople itself. In the1080s, Venice aided Constantinople in its defense against a Norman attempt totake the city. For their reward, the Byzantine Emperor “affixed his golden seal(the bulla aurea) to a document that would change the sea forever.”32 In thisdocument, Venice’s merchants were granted the right to trade throughout theEmpire, exempt from taxation. A large number of cities and ports were specified by name: Athensand Salonika, Thebes and Antioch and Ephesus, the islands of Chios and Euboea,key harbors along the coasts of southern Greece such as Modon andCoron—invaluable staging posts for Venetian galleys—but above all,Constantinople itself. Here, Venice was given a prize site down by the GoldenHorn. It included three quays, a church and bakery, shops and warehouses forstoring goods. Though nominal subjects of the emperor, the Venetians hadeffectively acquired their own colony, with all the necessary infrastructure, inthe heart of the richest city on earth, under extremely favorable conditions… .Quietly echoing the solemn convoluted lines of the Byzantine decree was thesweetest Greek word a Venetian might ever want to hear: monopoly. Venice’sjostling rivals in maritime trade—Genoa, Pisa, and Amalfi—were now put at suchdisadvantage that their presence in Constantinople was almost futile. The Golden Bull of 1082 was the golden key that opened upthe treasure-house of eastern trade for Venice.33The Venetian colony in Constantinople grew to approximately twelve thousandpeople rather quickly, and, as Roger Crowley notes, slowly, “decade by decade,the trade of Byzantium imperceptibly passed into their hands.”34 Venice hadbecome the lifeblood of the Byzantine Empire. This, more than anything else, wasthe document that catapulted the Venetian Empire into such economic and militarydominance.b. The Fourth Crusade and the Venetian Sacking of Constantinople[Contents.html#rsec35](1) The Sequence [Contents.html#rsec36]This was the circumstance, then, behind what must surely be one of the mostdespicable betrayals in history: the Venetian role in the Fourth Crusade(1202–1204), and its sacking of Constantinople, in April 1204. This misadventureis one of the most sordid in Western history and some time must be given to it,in order to appreciate Venice’s role, and the possible hidden implications thatemerge when one adds a bit of speculation into the mixture.We may begin this part of the story by observing that the East Romans35 grew toregret the implications of the Golden Bull of 1082, as Venice quickly becamesynonymous with the trade of the Empire itself. For Venice’s part, it was amatter of a careful diplomatic balancing act between the East Romans and theCrusades “on the one hand and their enemy, the Fatimid dynasty in Egypt, on theother.”36 Matters were not helped, at least as far as the East Romans wereconcerned, by the fact that Venice continued to trade war material, includingslaves, with the Fatimids, the mortal enemy of Byzantium. The one weapon thatByzantium did have against the Venetians remained the imperial control oftrading privileges. This was exercised against the growing power of Venice intypically byzantine fashion, by “playing the Republic off against its commercialrivals, Pisa and Genoa,”37 for by 1111 Pisa had been given similar imperialtrading privileges in Constantinople, and in 1156, Genoa—Venice’s great maritimerival—was granted privileges. Both Pisa and Genoa, like Venice in the originalGolden Bull of 1082, were granted “tax breaks, a commercial quarter, and landingstages” in the imperial capital.38Even that was not enough to stem the tide of Venetian influence, so in 1171,Emperor Manuel I “took the whole Venetian population in his empire hostage anddetained it for years. The crisis took two decades to resolve and left a bitterlegacy of mutual mistrust.”39 Then, in 1198, Pope Innocent III called for aFourth Crusade against the Islamic world. And with that, the stage was set forthe episode that set Byzantium and Venice on a collision course.When the call was issued, both Genoa and Pisa were at war with each other,leaving Venice alone with the material and maritime resources able to transportan army to the Middle East. The pope, in his call for the Crusade, had forbiddentrade with the Islamic world, and this, of course, Venice could not abide.Hence, it sent legates to Rome to negotiate a lifting of the ban. Innocent III,needing Venetian galleys to transport the Crusade army, relented and lifted theban, but placed a carefully worded prohibition on any trade of war material tothe Middle East.40Against that backdrop, six French knights arrived in Venice during the firstweek of Lent in 1201 to negotiate with the Venetian Doge, Enrico Dandolo, theterms of Venetian involvement in the Crusade. Dandolo, at this point, was overninety years old and blind, and hence was known as “the blind Doge.”41Here we must digress, for no one knows exactly how Doge Dandolo became blind inthe first place. He always maintained that it had occurred from a blow to hishead.42 But others were not so sure that he was even blind at all, for “his eyeswere attested to be indeed still bright and clear,” and, as we shall see,Dandolo played a crucial role in leading the Venetian military and navaleffort.43 Others merely maintained that the old Doge carefully concealed hisblindness. But in any case, Dandolo became symbolic of the cunning and byzantinemethods that many came—justifiably—to attribute to the Most Serene Republic.After carefully scrutinizing the knights’ testimonial letters and concludingthat they were authentic, the Blind Doge entered formal negotiations, and termswere quickly concluded. The Venetians’ terms were generous, and, upon carefulexamination, duplicitous: We will build horse transports to carry 4,500 horses and 9,000squires; and 4,500 knights and 20,000 foot soldiers will be embarked on ships;and our terms will include provisions for both men and horses for nine months.This is the minimum we will provide, conditional on payment of four marks perhorse and two per man. And all the terms we are setting out for you will bevalid for a year from the day of departure from the port of Venice to serve Godand Christendom, wherever that may take us. The sum of money specified abovetotals 94,000 marks. And we will additionally supply fifty armed galleys, freeof charge, for as long as our alliance lasts, with the condition that we receivehalf of all the conquests that we make, either by way of territory or money,either by land or at sea. Now take counsel among yourselves as to whether youare willing and able to go ahead with this.44Note the phrase “wherever that may take us,” for the knights quickly assented tothe terms and the contract of alliance was concluded. Little did they or PopeInnocent III know that the contract’s lack of any mention of Egypt wasdeliberate, for as the contract was being sealed, Venetian ambassadors were inCairo negotiating a trade agreement with the Viceroy of the Sultan, giving him“a categorical assurance that Venice had no intention of being party to anyattack on Egyptian territory.”45That left a landing in the Eastern Mediterranean town of Acre as the only viableoption, unless of course the Venetian objective was something else entirely, assuggested by the phrase “wherever that may take us.” As we shall see the eventsunfold, this may indeed be a possibility, for while Venice was secretlynegotiating assurances with Cairo, at the very same time it had negotiated asecret agreement with the knights themselves that the destination was not to bethe Holy Land, but Egypt!46 What was the driving force behind this agenda? It isworth noting that a mere one hundred years earlier, the Venetian Doge OrdelafoFalier (1101–1118) “had raised to the status of a patriotic duty the demand thatmerchant ships returning from the East should bring back antiquities, marbles,and carvings for the decoration of the newly rebuilt Church of Saint Mark.”47This raises the possibility that other types of “antiquities” were actuallybeing sought, such as manuscripts and ancient maps, an invaluable source ofknowledge to a maritime power such as Venice. As we shall see later in thischapter, and again in chapter nine [Chapter009.html], this possibility becomesmore likely as each episode is considered. That Egypt may have been, at least asfar as the knights were concerned, the ultimate strategic objective mademilitary sense, for Saladin’s incomparable victories over the Crusaders in theHoly Land had been accomplished by drawing on the vast resources of Egypt andthe supply lines from Alexandria and Cairo.As far as the knights were concerned, the expedition was to cut the supply linesto the Holy Land, leaving it to fall into the Crusading army’s lap like anover-ripened fruit. But note that as far as Venice was concerned, the secretdouble-dealings between the Egyptian Viceroy and the French knights had leftthem in de facto control of the objectives, since they commanded the fleet thatwas to transport the army. Venice had created conditions of maximum diplomaticand military flexibility, which could be exploited to the fullest for its ownbenefit. Indeed, if they chose to land the expedition in Egypt, Venice stood togain by stealing the Genoese and Pisan dominance of Egyptian trade out fromunderneath them.And already, the Venetians had profited from the contract of alliance, known asthe Treaty of Venice, for the knights had to borrow the first two thousand marksof down payment from Venetian banks on the Rialto to finance the expedition.48In any case, the fleet was to be ready to receive the crusading army by SaintJohn’s Day, June 24, in 1202.49All the construction of this vast fleet, with its siege engines, ropes, galleys,sails and so on was conducted in large part by the Venetian State Arsenal,established in 1104 a kind of assembly line of the implements of military andmaritime power.50 When the date for the assembly and embarkation of the armycame, the army had barely begun to assemble, stragglers were coming in smallnumbers, and the size of the army was far below that for which Venice and theknights had contracted. Other portions of the army simply departed for the Eastfrom other ports altogether. By July, the army was still assembling in Venice,but its numbers were still far below that for which the alliance was negotiated.As time wore on, tensions increased between the army and the Venetians, andstill the army had not sailed for the East.At this juncture, Dandolo negotiated a deferment of payment from the army inreturn for the army’s embarkation and a share in its conquests.51 And the veryfirst of these targets that Dandolo had in mind was the port city of Zara, onthe Dalmatian coast of the Adriatic, long a thorn in Venice’s eyes, and, mostimportantly, a Christian city. Pope Innocent III, learning of Dandolo’sintentions, threatened the entire city of Venice with excommunication should itattack Zara.52 In spite of this threat, Zara was attacked, and the Lion of St.Mark once again flew from its ramparts, virtually guaranteeing that the entireAdriatic sea was now a Venetian lake. But the papal excommunication came anyway.By the time Zara had fallen, it was too late to continue the Crusade duringwinter. And here, once again, fate—and Venetian diplomatic treachery—intervened.On January 1, 1203, King Philip of Swabia sent ambassadors to the Crusading armyand to Doge Dandolo, who was travelling with them. Philip’s brother-in-law wasan East Roman nobleman and prince, Alexius Angelus, whose uncle, Isaac, had beendeposed from the imperial throne in Constantinople by its current Emperor,Alexius III. It is quite crucial to note that this political backdrop wasclearly known to Dandolo and the Venetian diplomatic corps long before theexpedition finally set sail. And we have already seen the example of Venetianduplicity with respect to the Egyptians and to the French knights. So this opensup the possibility that the embassy from Philip, and Philip’s and AlexiusAngelus’ intentions, were known prior to the expedition ever having embarked.The Germans offered the Crusaders and Dandolo a new deal: in return for Venetiansupport in restoring Alexius’ “inheritance,” i.e. the imperial throne ofConstantinople, Alexius in return would place the entire Eastern Church—whichhad severed communion with the papacy and the Church of the West some threehundred years before—under Roman obedience. The deal was sweetened with apromise to pay the Venetians 200,000 silver marks, and to pledge East Romanmilitary assistance in Egypt for a year.53 Dandolo, in the meantime, hadcompletely razed Zara’s fortifications and palaces, leaving only the churchesstanding, “determined that the rebellious city should be incapable of furtherdefiance.”54Meanwhile, Pope Innocent III thundered excommunications against the Venetians inthe expedition. Unfortunately, his letters were simply suppressed by the bishopsaccompanying the army,55 doubtless at the instigation of Dandolo.In any case, the expedition, now determined upon Constantinople as its target,arrived in the imperial city on June 23, 1203. While the details are too lengthyto go into here,56 it is to be noted that the Blind Doge himself played aleading role in the assault, thus again raising the question of whether or nothe was truly blind. In any case, the result of the sack of Constantinople by theFourth Crusade was predictable: a Latin hierarchy was installed inConstantinople, and a Latin Emperor, virtually a puppet of Venice, was alsoinstalled. But most importantly, Venice obtained a virtual lock-out of rivalsPisa and Genoa from Constantinople and a restoration of its monopoly tradingprivileges. Given that Venice had negotiated duplicitously both with Egypt andwith the French knights, and that the Crusade ended up in Constantinople withVenice exercising a virtual stranglehold on the Empire, it is possible that thiswas the Blind Doge’s intentions from the outset.But there was something else Venice may have gained, and here the facts end, andthe speculations begin …(2) The Speculation [Contents.html#rsec37]At one time, at the height of its extent from the Emperors Justinian I toHeraclius I (610–641), the East Roman or Byzantine Empire extended from Tunisiain North Africa through Egypt, into Mesopotamia, Anatolia, the southern Balkanpeninsula, and of course Dalmatia, Venezia, and southern Italy. As such, it hadaccess to the rich library resources of Egypt and whatever may have remained ofthe treasures of the lost library of Alexandria, including whatever was left ofancient high maritime knowledge and maps. As we shall discover in chapter nine[Chapter009.html], there is indeed evidence that such maritime knowledge, andother lost knowledge from Egypt, made its way into the imperial archives ofConstantinople. The imperial city was not only a vast storehouse of actualtreasures,57 but a treasure house of information.Let us now make an assumption, involving the following components: 1) That there was in High Antiquity a maritime knowledge of the worldcommensurate with our own, and this knowledge included the existence of theNorth and South American (and Antarctic) continents that were only (re)discovered during the voyages of exploration in the fifteenth century; 2) That this knowledge was retained on charts and maps copied, withvarying degrees of accuracy, through the ages; 3) That this knowledge was retained in various repositories, includingthe Library of Alexandria; 4) That some of this knowledge survived the destructive fires that sweptthat Library; and finally, 5) That some of this knowledge made it to the imperial archives of theEast Roman Empire.As will be discovered in chapter nine [Chapter009.html], there is some evidencethat all these components of our assumption are true.Now we make one final assumption. We assume that at some point Venice may haveencountered the existence of this knowledge, perhaps during the sack ofConstantinople, and the re-establishment of its monopoly over the trade throughthe imperial city. What would Venice have done with such knowledge, if it hadpossessed it? I contend that it would have suppressed that knowledge, for thesimple fact that its geopolitical situation in the northwest of the Adriatic Seawould not have easily allowed it access through the Straits of Gibraltar, havingto run the gauntlet of Genoese, Pisan, and later Spanish dominance of theWestern Mediterranean. The opening of trade routes that by-passed the EasternMediterranean and overland routes to the Far East, much less of a whole “NewWorld,” would have been a threat to that trading Empire, one which, given itsgeopolitical situation, Venice would have wanted to suppress, and to deny topotential competitors. Indeed, as we shall see in chapter nine[Chapter009.html], there is a Genoese connection to this whole train of thought… a famous one in fact.c. The Fall of Constantinople (1453), and the Beginning of the Decline[Contents.html#rsec38]For the moment, however, we must return to our historical survey.When Constantinople finally fell to the Turks and Sultan Mehmet II in 1453, itwas inevitable that many Greeks fled to the most Byzantine city in the west,bringing what remained of the library and treasures of the Imperial City withthem58 and thus contributing to the rise of the Renaissance in Italy in thefifteenth century. But we are getting ahead of ourselves, for the Fall ofConstantinople to the Turks also meant that Venice became the frontline state ofChristendom.59 As the Ottoman Empire slowly and gradually grew in military andnaval power, Venice’s colonies and bases in the eastern Mediterranean wereslowly chipped away, forcing the Republic to turn to an expansion of territoryon the Italian mainland. Additionally, the opening of the route to the Far Eastaround the horn of Africa by Portugal, and the discovery of the New World byGenoese adventurer Christopher Columbus for Spain, spelled the end of Venice’svirtual trading monopoly with the East. Indeed, Tarpley notes that the discoveryof the New World meant that “At the deepest level, some patricians realized thatthe lagoon city could now be crushed like an egg-shell, and was not a suitablebase for world domination. As after 1200 there had been talk of moving thecapital, perhaps to Constantinople, so now plans began to hatch that wouldfacilitate a metastasis of the Venetian cancer towards the Atlantic world.”60 Weshall have more to say about that metastasis later in this and subsequentchapters.3. The Reformation, Counter-Reformation, and Venice [Contents.html#rsec39]The other signal event, after the discovery of the New World and its subsequentcolonization in the 16th century, was the Protestant Reformation and CatholicCounter-Reformation, and we shall spend some time with it, because again bothVenice and Giordano Bruno are curiously implicated.To see exactly how Bruno and Venice are implicated, it is important to recallfrom the previous chapter that Bruno’s basic cosmological view was Hermetic andNeoplatonic in nature, reliant upon that ancient Topological Metaphor of theMedium. The Venetian oligarchy, conversely, pursued a basic cosmological view ofmaterialism, rooted in “the cult of Aristotle.”61 Indeed, as Webster Tarpleynotes, the Venetians were the first Western Europeans to read Aristotle in theoriginal Greek.62Into the midst of this ferment stepped Martin Luther, with his doctrine ofjustification by faith alone. But there is a hidden Venetian influence onLuther. Gasparo Cardinal Contarini—and pay attention to that last name for wewill encounter it again in the next chapter in an extraordinary way—wrote anamazing passage during the crisis of the League of Cambrai (which we shalldiscuss in the next section): I began with my whole spirit to turn to this greatest good whichI saw, for love of me, on the cross, with his arms open, and his breast openedup right to his heart. This I, the wretch who had not had enough courage for theatonement of my iniquities to leave the world and do penance, turned to him; andsince I asked him to let me share in the satisfaction which he, without any sinsof his own, had made for us, he was quick to accept me and to cause his Fathercompletely to cancel the debt I had contracted, which I myself was incapable ofsatisfying.63This is, of course, an appeal to the doctrine of Anselm of Canterbury, whoformulated the doctrine of the Atonement in terms of debt. According to thisdoctrine, mankind, having offended the infinitely righteous God, owed aninfinite debt to Him, but since mankind was only finite, could never pay it.Yet, since mankind owed the debt, only mankind could be the responsible partyfor paying it. Anselm’s solution to this dilemma was to state that this was thereason for the Incarnation. The infinite Son of God became man, and repaid thedebt, thus “balancing the books,” a doctrine that effectively reduced God andsalvation to a ledger transaction.64 It is highly significant that, once again,we find the pattern we first encountered in Babylon’s Banksters being repeated,namely the association of the temple with finance, this time through the directimportation into religion of the language of debt redemption and sacrifice. Andit is equally significant that a Venetian Cardinal is adopting this language. AsTarpley notes, “the parallels to Luther are evident, even though Contarini stillallows hope and a little love a role in salvation, in addition to faith. Later,in a letter of 1523, after Contarini had seen Luther, he would go beyond thisand wholly embrace the Lutheran position.”65Note what we have: a Roman Catholic Cardinal embracing the Lutheran position atthe height of the beginning crisis of the Reformation. This is, as we shall seeshortly, not the only time Venetian agents are playing both sides of thereligious issue, for we find at the same time, in Henry VIII’s England, ThomasCromwell, who had replaced Cardinal Wolsey as Henry’s chief advisor. “Cromwell,”Tarpley notes, “had reportedly been a mercenary soldier in Italy during the warsof the early 1500s, and, according to (Cardinal) Pole, was at one time the clerkor bookkeeper to a Venetian merchant. One version has Cromwell working for 20years for a Venetian branch office in Antwerp.”66 Concurrently with all of this,Pope Paul III directed Cardinal Contarini—the same man who had embraced abasically Lutheran position—“to chair a commission that would develop ways toreform the church. Contarini was joined by Caraffa, Sadoletol Pole, Giberti,Cortese of San Giorgio Maggiore,67 plus prelates from Salerno and Brindisi—anoverwhelmingly Venetian commission.”68 In other words, Venice had taken controlof the Catholic Counter-Reformation.One effect of this commission and the Catholic reforming Council of Trent wasthe creation of the notorious “Index” of books which were prohibited forCatholics to read. Needless to say, the “Aristotelian” bias of the Index quicklybecame evident, as Neoplatonic and Hermetic books were prohibited. It was, asTarpley observed, “a barometer of who now held power in Rome. By 1565, therewere no fewer than seven Venetian cardinals.”69 Here lies the ultimate reasonfor Bruno’s denunciation by Mocenigo, for Bruno, of course, was a Hermeticist,and his cosmology challenged the whole broadly Aristotelian materialism thatVenice was trying to promote.But Venice’s promotion of both sides of the emerging religious conflict duringthe sixteenth century was deliberate. Then, as now, the world was entering a newera of the rapid dissemination of information made possible by the movable typeprinting press. Then, as now, this threatened the power of oligarchicalfinancial elites, particularly that of Venice, and then, as now, that elitemoved quickly to inject its influence into the information stream by acquiringthe technology of the printing press, and quickly promoting the publication ofworks of both sides in the religious controversy. Tarpley observes that “Whatgave Luther and the rest of the Protestant reformers real clout was a publicityand diffusion of their ideas that owed much to the Venetian publishingestablishment. The Venetian presses quickly turned out 40,000 copies of thewritings of Luther, Calvin, Melancthon, and the heresiarch Juan Valdes,especially popular in Italy.”70 Meanwhile, the same Gasparo Cardinal Contariniwho had adopted the views of Martin Luther had cultivated a relationship withIgnatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits, and the implacable foe ofProtestantism. Contarini intervened directly with the Pope to influence thepapal approval of the Jesuit order.71Why would Venice have played both sides against the middle, backing bothProtestant and Catholic causes? As noted previously, the discovery of the NewWorld spelled the end of the Venetian trade and financial empire. The strategicdecision was therefore taken to quite literally transfer the headquarters oftheir financial oligarchy northward, under the cover of deliberately exacerbatedreligious tensions in Europe.72 It was a goal of Venetian policy to foment ageneral religious war in Europe to facilitate the transfer of the vast familyoligarchical fortunes northward,73 a war that eventually became the ThirtyYears’ War (1618–1648).In the sixteenth century, however, it was Gasparo Cardinal Contarini who was atthe center of networks reaching deep into both Catholic and Protestant Europe,dispatching his agent Francesco Zorzi to England to act as Henry VIII’s “sexcouncilor” in his divorce from Catherine of Aragon. Contarini’s networks alsoprotected John Calvin and Luther74 while Contarini was involved in helping tomidwife the Jesuit order into existence! Venice’s influence in Lutheran Germanyand Bohemia, moreover, was the Count Heinrich Mathias “of Thurn-Valsassina(1567–1633). This is the senior branch of the family, originally from Venetianterritory, which is otherwise known as della Torre, Torre e Tasso, and later asThurn und Taxis.”75 This, as we shall discover in coming chapters, is not theonly link between the oligarchical families of the northern Italian city-statesand the prominent and powerful noble houses of Saxony, Hanover, the Netherlands,and England.Bruno, of course, stepped into this picture in the late sixteenth century withhis journeys—suspiciously—to Calvin’s Geneva, Catholic Paris, Anglican England,and Lutheran Germany, before being tempted back to Venice by the perfidiousMocenigo. Bruno, in other words, may have been a Venetian agent in his travels.There is some evidence for this. Tarpley notes that After 1582, the oligarchical Venetian government institutionswere controlled by the Giovani, a cabal of patricians who had emerged from asalon of strategic discussions called Ridotto Morosini. The participantsincluded Morosini, Nicolo Contarini [!], Leonardo Dona, Antonio Querini, theServite monks Paolo Sarpi, and Fulganzio Micanzio, Galileo Galilei, andsometimes Griodano Bruno.76Indeed, Tarpley states explicitly that Venice sent Bruno, and later one of hisdisciples, to Paris.77Here we must pause and speculate for a moment about why Venice would then havebeen so complicit in Bruno’s execution. As we have noted in previous chapters,Bruno’s whole cosmological and memory system posed a threat to the basicworldview of Venice. It was something the Venetian oligarchy both had to controland monopolize for its own purposes, as evident in Mocenigo’s efforts to getBruno to teach him his memory system, and also to prevent spreading to itspotential rivals.But now we have an additional possible motivation behind Venice’s role inBruno’s arrest, for Bruno, it will be recalled, had disclosed to Zuane Mocenigohis intentions to found a secret society precisely to spread his Hermeticteachings, an act that would have spelled an end to the Venetian oligarchy’sattempt to monopolize the system. Additionally, according to Tarpley Bruno was apart of the strategic discussions in Venice, which may indeed have disclosed tohim Venetian intentions to foment a religious crisis. On that score alone, Brunomay have been able to expose the whole enterprise, and thus had to beeliminated.By the end of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth,shortly after Bruno’s execution by the Inquisition, Venice had done somethingelse, and here we must cite Tarpley extensively: Venice was extremely liquid at this time, with about 14 millionducats in coins in reserve around 1600.78 At about the same time, incredibly,the Venetian regime had completed the process of paying off its entire publicdebt, leaving the state with no outstanding obligations of any type. Thisoverall highly liquid situation is a sure sign that flights of capital areunderway, in the direction of the countries singled out by the Giovani as futurepartners or victims: France, England, and the Netherlands. The Genoese around the St. George’s Bank receivedvirtually the entire world’s circulating gold stocks. The two cities teamed upstarting around 1579 at the Piacenza Fair, a prototype of a clearing house forEuropean banks, which soon had a turnover of 20 million ducats a year. This fairwas a precursor of the post-Versailles Bank for International Settlements. In 1603, Venice and Genoa assumed direction of thefinances of Stuart England, and imparted their characteristic method into theBritish East India Company. It is also this tandem that was present at thecreation of the great Amsterdam Bank, the financial hinge of the seventeenthcentury, and of the Dutch East India Company. Venice and Genoa were also themidwives for the great financial power growing up in Geneva, which specializedin controlling the French public debt and in fostering the delphic spirits ofthe Enlightenment.79In other words, during the religious upheavals of the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies (which Venice certainly helped exacerbate, as we have seen, bypublishing Protestant works while simultaneously promoting the creation of theJesuit order and playing an influential role in the CatholicCounter-Reformation), Venice was quietly creating new corporate fronts inAmsterdam and England, and transferring the bulk of the oligarchical familyfortunes from the swamp in the Venetian lagoon to the swamp from which Amsterdamgrew.But why, in addition to its strategic conclusion that the seat of theiroligarchical empire had to be transferred northward and toward the Atlanticbecause of the discovery of the New World, did Venice sense such urgency totransfer its base of operations? The answer is in what was, literally, the firstreal general European War, the War of the League of Cambrai …4. The War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516): The True First General EuropeanWar [Contents.html#rsec40]By 1508, Europe had had it with the byzantine methods, intrigues, and doubledealings of the oligarchs and bankers of the Most Serene Republic of Venice. Itwas, literally a war of Europe—represented by the Papacy, France, Spain, and theHapsburg Empire in Austria—against Venice.80 The formation of this powerfulalliance was the brainchild of Julius Cardinal della Rovere, who, upon hiselection to the Papacy, took the name of Julius II. Julius determined to put anend to Venetian ecclesiastical independence after typically Venetian affronts tothe papacy: Determined to assert his jurisdiction, ‘even’—as he put it—‘if itcosts me the tiara itself’, he now summoned all his diplomatic strength towardshis primary objective, not just the isolation but the humiliation of Venice, herdeliberate reduction to a level whence she could never recover her old authorityand prosperity. A new stream of emissaries was dispatched from Rome—to Franceand Spain, to (Hapsburg Emperor) Maximilian, to Milan, to Hungary and theNetherlands. All bore the same proposal, for a joint expedition by westernChristendom against the Venetian Republic, and the consequent dismemberment ofher Empire.81The carrots Pope Julius II dangled in front of each of the European powers weresignificant. The Austrian Hapsburg Empire would receive Verona, Vicienza, andPadua. France would obtain the territories of Bergamo, Brescia, Crema, Cremona“and all those territories that Venice had acquired by the Treaty of Blois nineyears before.”82 In southern Italy, Brindisi and Otranto would go back to theHouse of Aragon and Hungary would receive the Dalmatian coast. There would, asJohn Julian Norwich quipped, “Be something for everyone.”83 Julius’sgeopolitical reasoning was simple: in the south, Spanish Naples was the strongstate, in the north, French-dominated Milan. But the rest of Italy had to bedominated by the Papacy, and that meant the Venetian Empire had to go.84We can get a measure of European loss of patience with the Most Serene Republicby a glance at the actual formal preamble to the Treaty that created the Leagueof Cambrai, for it was formed, as it explicitly states, … to put an end to the losses, the injuries, the violations, thedamages which the Venetians have inflicted, not only on the Apostolic See but onthe Holy Roman Empire, on the House of Austria, on the Dukes of Milan, on theKings of Naples and on divers other princes, occupying and tyrannically usurpingtheir goods, their possessions, their cities and castles, as if they haddeliberately conspired to do ill to all around them. Thus we have found it not only will-advised andhonourable, but even necessary, to summon all people to take their just revengeand so to extinguish, like a great fire, the insatiable rapacity of theVenetians and their thirst for power.85France quickly marched, and inflicted a crushing defeat on Venetian forces atthe Battle of Agnadello.86 Emperor Maximilian quickly mobilized a large army andalso began to move—slowly—against Venice.With the advent of the Portuguese trade routes around Africa and the rise of theOttoman Empire in the Middle East, the impending loss of her territories on theItalian mainland spelled disaster for Venice, for her Empire no longer dependedsolely on sea trade.87Venice had to fight against overwhelming odds, and though it retook Padua fromthe French and subsequently successfully defended it against French and Imperialforces,88 causing the League to begin to unravel with the help of quiet Venetiandiplomacy,89 the mere threat of Maximilian’s huge armies pressing from thenorth, and papal armies from the south, forced Venice to contemplate theunthinkable: an alliance with the Ottoman Empire.90 “To the princes of the West,had they known of it, such an appeal could only have appeared as an additionalproof of Venetian faithlessness.”91 Unfortunately for the Venetians, the Sultandid not respond to their proposals, forcing Venice to accept Pope Julius II’sterms: They proved savage: Venice must subject herself totally to theHoly See. Gone would be her traditional right to appoint bishops and clergywithin her boundaries, to try them in her courts, to tax them without papalconsent. Gone, too, would be her jurisdiction over subjects of the papal statesin her territory. The Pope was to receive full compensation for all his expensesin recovering his territories and for all the revenues which he had lost whilethose territories were in Venetian hands. The Adriatic Sea was henceforth to beopen to all, free of the customs dues which Venice had been accustomed to demandfrom foreign shipping.92With the Venetian surrender, Julius II had effectively dissolved his own league,viewing France now as the chief enemy in the north, and effectively siding withVenice.93 The League had for all intents and purposes fallen apart.94Finally, to make a very long and complicated story short, when the Venetian andPapal alliance against the French in northern Italy proved to be of no benefitto Venice when Julius essentially cut them out of any share of the spoils,Venice, in typical fashion, changed sides once again and allied with France.95Julius’ treachery was not helped by his threat against Venice to revive theLeague of Cambrai. Thus, in scarcely more than four years, the three principalprotagonists in the war of the League of Cambrai had gone through every possiblepermutation in the pattern of alliances. First France and the Papacy were alliedagainst Venice, then Venice and the Papacy ranged themselves against France; nowVenice and France combined against the Papacy—and indeed, all comers.96One sees here the Venetian behavior and Realpolitik that had led to theformation of the League in the first place, with the city-state performingclassic balance-of-power diplomacy and playing its chief rivals off against eachother. But for Venice and its financial oligarchs, the lessons of the League,and the discovery of the New World shortly before, were clear: the oligarchs hadto move headquarters.5. The End of the Most Serene Republic: Napoleon Bonaparte and His PeculiarDemands [Contents.html#rsec41]The end of the Most Serene Republic of Venice came, of course, fromrevolutionary France, and a general named Napoleon Bonaparte. Since thebeginning of the French Revolution, Venetian intelligence had been warning theRepublic of the danger that the revolutionaries posed,97 in their statedobjective to export the revolution to all of Europe. Venice was a particulartarget because, as we shall discover in the next chapter, her constitution,while republican, was hardly the embodiment of the egalitarian principles of theFrench Revolution. Quite the contrary, it was an elitist constitution,98 arepublic by the oligarchy and for the oligarchy. By the time of Napoleon’snorthern Italian campaign against Austria and the arrival of French armies onVenice’s doorstep, the rot had long set in, and the real financial power hadlong since been transferred northward.Bonaparte’s demands, as the French ships began to unload artillery on the outerislands of the lagoon, say it all: the oligarchy must dissolve the Republic andabdicate, replacing the constitution with a democracy.99 Napoleon also demanded,“The credit of the mint and the national bank (were) to be guaranteed by thestate.”100 In effect, Bonaparte had said that the oligarchy must abdicate notonly their political power, but their financial monopoly over the credit andcurrency of the Venetian state.But as we have seen, almost two centuries before the arrival of Napoleon theoligarchs had liquidated the public debt and assembled a huge reserve of liquidcapital for their flight capital program northwards, a long-range strategicconsideration that in its outlines resembles the similar flight capital plan ofthe Nazis toward the end of World War II. By the time Napoleon forced thedissolution of the Republic, the spoils had fled.But what was the secret of Venetian oligarchical longevity? Indeed, who were theoligarchs? This is where the story gets even darker …________________________1 Webster Griffin Tarpley, “The Venetian Conspiracy,” Against Oligarchy,http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/the-venetian-conspiracy/[http://http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/the-venetian-conspiracy/],p. 1.2 Tarpley, “The Role of the Venetian Oligarchy in Reformation,Counter-Reformation, Enlightenment, and the Thirty Years’ War,” AgainstOligarchy,http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/the-venetian-conspiracy/[http://http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/the-venetian-conspiracy/],p. 1.3 For this episode, see John Julian Norwich, A History of Venice (New York:Vintage Books, 1989), pp. 29-30.4 Farrell, Babylon’s Banksters, pp. 267–274.5 Ibid., p. 268.6 Ibid.7 Ibid.8 Ibid., p. 269.9 Ibid., p. 270.10 Tenney Frank, The American Historical Review, Vol. 21, July 21, 1916, p.689, cited in Farrell, Babylon’s Banksters, p. 268.11 Ibid., pp. 689–690, emphasis added, cited in Babylon’s Banksters, p. 270.12 Farrell, Babylon’s Banksters, p. 270, citing Juvenal, Satires, III:62.13 Farrell, Babylon’s Banksters, p. 271.14 Ibid., p. 272.15 Tarpley, “Venice’s War Against Western Civilization,” Against Oligarchy,http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/venices-war-against-western-civilization/[http://http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/venices-war-against-western-civilization/],p. 2.16 As I point out in my The Cosmic War, p. 328, the symbolism also hasancient Egyptian roots as well.17 Tarpley notes: “Already between 300 and 400 AD there are traces offamilies whose names will later become infamous: Candiano, Faliero, Dandolo.Legend has it that the big influx of refugees came during the raids of Attilathe Hun in 452 A.D.” (See Tarpley, “The Venetian Conspiracy.”)18 Norwich, A History of Venice, p. 4.19 Ibid., p. 5.20 Ibid., p. 7.21 Roger Crowley, City of Fortune: How Venice Ruled the Seas (New York:Random House), p. xxix.22 Ibid.23 Ibid., p. 16.24 Ibid.25 See Norwich, A History of Venice, p. 8.26 Ibid., p. 9.27 Ibid., p. 15.28 Ibid., p. 24.29 Norwich, A History of Venice, p. 24.30 Ibid., p. 25.31 Ibid., pp. 29–30.32 Crowley, City of Fortune, p. 16.33 Ibid., pp. 16–17.34 Ibid., p. 17.35 I refer to them as such because the subjects of the Empire, thoughpredominantly Greeks or Greek-speaking, called themselves “Romans” as a matterof their “national and cultural identity.” They did not call themselves“Byzantines” and as such, to do so now would be an inaccuracy.36 Crowley, City of Fortune, p. 17.37 Ibid., p. 18.38 Ibid.39 Ibid., p. 19.40 Crowley, City of Fortune, pp. 21–22.41 Ibid., pp. 22–23.42 Ibid., p. 24.43 Ibid. Norwich maintains that Enrico Dandolo’s relative Andrea Dandolo, ahistorian, stated that Enrico’s blindness came from his antagonism of the RomanEmperor Manuel I during the hostage crisis, and that, as was Byzantine legalcustom, Dandolo was blinded on the Emperor’s command. (See Norwich, A History ofVenice, p. 124.)44 Crowley, City of Fortune, pp. 25–26, emphasis added.45 Norwich, A History of Venice, p. 128.46 Crowley, City of Fortune, p. 31.47 Ibid., p. 30, emphasis added.48 Ibid., p. 34.49 Ibid., p. 29.50 Ibid., pp. 35–36.51 Ibid., p. 41.52 Ibid., p. 48.53 Ibid., pp. 53–54. It should be noted that Crowley states, “It is uncertainif Dandolo knew in advance of the plan to divert the Crusade to Constantinople;it is likely that he appraised it with a very cool eye,” (p. 55). I find thishighly unlikely, since a trading empire such as Venice would certainly have hadup-to-date intelligence on the circumstances in Egypt, Constantinople, andGermany, with which it carried on a lucrative trade in silver bullion and othercommodities. In my opinion Dandolo skillfully negotiated the original contractto allow Venice maximum flexibility, including the ability to change thestrategic objectives of the Crusade. He could hardly have been oblivious to thecircumstances of Alexius Angelus and his imperial claims, and given the priorbitterness between Byzantium and Venice over the Venetian hostage crisis, andByzantium’s subsequent allowance of rivals Pisa’s and Genoa’s tradingprivileges, I think it is highly likely that this entered into Venetian planningfrom the outset. The attack against Zara would therefore have been an inevitablelure to the Germans to send the embassy, making it appear that Alexius, and notVenice, had initiated the events that followed.54 Ibid., p. 57.55 Ibid., p. 56.56 For the story of the Fourth Crusade’s sack of Constantinople, see theeminently readable account in Crowley, pp. 60–92.57 Ibid., pp. 64, 103.58 Norwich, A History of Venice, p. 340.59 Crowley, City of Fortune, p. 317.60 Tarpley, “The Role of the Venetian Oligarchy,” pp. 2–3.61 Ibid., p. 162 Ibid.63 Ibid., p. 4, citing Jedin, “Ein ‘Thurmerlebnis’ des jungen Contarini,” p.117, and Dermot Fenlon, “Heresy and Obedience in Tridentine Italy,” p. 8.64 See Farrell and de Hart, The Grid of the Gods, pp. 201–217.65 Tarpley, “The Role of the Venetian Oligarchy,” p. 4.66 Ibid., p. 8.67 San Giorgio Maggiore, the Benedictine monastery dedicated to St. George inthe Venetian lagoon.68 Ibid., p. 9.69 Ibid, p. 11.70 Tarpley, “The Venetian Conspiracy,” p. 16.71 Ibid., p. 17.72 Tarpley, “The Role of the Venetian Oligarchy,” p. 9.73 Ibid., p. 14.74 Tarpley, “Venice’s War Against Western Civilization,” p. 4.75 Tarpley, “The Role of the Venetian Oligarchy,” p. 16.76 Ibid., p. 11.77 Tarpley, “Venice’s War Against Western Civilization,” p. 14.78 1600, it will be recalled, was the year of Bruno’s execution.79 Tarpley, “The Venetian Conspiracy,” p. 18.80 For the background to the formation of the League, see Norwich, A Historyof Venice, pp. 390–392.81 Ibid., p. 394.82 Ibid.83 Ibid.84 Ibid., p. 395.85 Ibid.86 Ibid., p. 399.87 Ibid., pp. 400–401.88 Ibid., pp. 404–405.89 Ibid., pp. 405–406.90 Ibid., p. 407.91 Ibid.92 Ibid., p. 408.93 Ibid., p. 409.94 Ibid., p. 414.95 Ibid, p. 425.96 Ibid., pp. 425–426.97 Ibid., p. 606.98 Ibid.99 Ibid., p. 627.100 Ibid., p. 630."},{"pageContent":"[images/chap.jpg][images/chap.jpg] Four [Contents.html#rch4][images/chap1.jpg][images/chap1.jpg]SERENISSIMA REPUBLICA, PART TWO: The Venetian Oligarchy: Its Methods, Agendas,Tactics, and Obsessions [Contents.html#rch4][images/bull3a.jpg]“If oligarchical methods are allowed to dominate human affairs, they alwayscreate a breakdown crisis of civilization, with economic depression, war,famine, plague, and pestilence.

In other words, Venice isin the hands of an oligarchy.3 Zuane Mocenigo, the man who turned Giordano Brunoover to the Venetian Inquisition after the latter refused to impart his secretsof memory, belonged to one of these families, the Mocenigos. The oligarchy, inother words, was possibly after the secrets of power of the Metaphor, and it iseasy to see why. Such memory secrets would allow the banking-oligarchy to keepbooks literally in their heads—secret books perhaps—while maintaining the publicledgers for government inspection. Even if this were not the case, such memoryabilities would give any banking family an immense advantage over its rivals.Indeed, as we shall discover later, keeping “secret account books” was ahallmark of the north Italian city-state oligarchies.Something else needs to be pointed out, and that is the tremendous continuity ofthese families over a large span of time. When placed into the wider context ofthe migrations of those families northward after the fall of the Western RomanEmpire, a picture emerges that allows one to speculate. In Babylon’s Banksters Ipointed out the deep connection between the ancient temple, astrology andastronomy, and the bullion brokers and banking classes of ancient times.4 We nowmake two assumptions: 1) That the continuity of oligarchical families represented in the listof the Doges of Venice represents a much deeper continuity of those familiesstretching back to Mesopotamia; and, 2) That this continuity in turn also continued the possible hiddenknowledge of the connection of economic cycles with theastronomical-astrological knowledge of the ancient temples, albeit in probablyweakened form.When these assumptions are made, it becomes much easier to see why Bruno wouldhave represented a threat to the Venetian banking oligarchies, for he wasliterally exposing secrets that they would not wish to see exposed.Additionally, given Bruno’s legendary memory prowess, it may have been evidentto those oligarchical families that their own knowledge or systems wereincomplete, and hence his secrets had to be pried from him, which would explainthe Mocenigo family’s interest. It would also explain why Mocenigo, in histestimony to the Inquisition, also mentioned that Bruno had talked aboutfounding a secret society, for it would be in their interest not to see suchknowledge spread in an underground stream, beyond their control.A. THE “STRUCTURE” AND METHODS OF THE VENETIAN REPUBLIC: THE MAJOR FAMILIES,PLAYERS, AND IMPLICATIONS [Contents.html#rsec42]1. The Methods of Empire [Contents.html#rsec43]In the previous chapter’s brief summary of Venetian history, we noted severalbyzantine methods that Venice employed to maintain the power and position of itsoligarchical ruling elite families: 1) The use of balance-of-power diplomacy, playing off powerful rivalsagainst each other through the fomenting of endless conflict which benefittedVenetian traders. For example, the sale of war material and slaves to theostensible enemies of Christendom, the Fatimid Muslims and Ottoman Turks,5 whilesimultaneously cultivating alliances and trading privileges with Byzantium, or,alternatively, in its shifting alliances during the crisis of the War of theLeague of Cambrai; 2) The exacerbation of the Protestant-Catholic religious divisions ofEurope during the Reformation, chiefly by the acquisition of the new technologyof the printing press, which was used to disseminate both Catholic andProtestant religious writings; 3) The possible recruitment of Hermeticists such as Giordano Bruno tolearn the secrets of Hermetic arts, to spread Venetian influence through thesame, and to suppress their wider public dissemination; 4) The possible suppression of hidden knowledge of the New World gainedfrom archives in Constantinople, which knowledge would have ended the Venetianoligarchy’s power; 5) The willingness to transfer the seat of oligarchical power to othercenters as the situation demanded, such as the consideration, at one point, totransfer the capital to Constantinople, and later, after the discovery of theNew World, to bases on the Atlantic coast allowing it access to the new globaltrade; 6) The creation of naval and military bases, rather than colonies per se,to protect Venetian trade and allow the swift projection of military force whennecessity occasioned it;6 7) The use of diplomacy with “short, sharp applications of militaryforce,”7 as we saw in the previous chapter with the Venetian sacking of Zara andConstantinople during the Fourth Crusade.We must now probe more deeply into the structures and methods of the Venetianoligarchical power, for in doing so, other secrets of the maintenance of suchpower are laid bare.2. The Three Pillars of Venetian Power [Contents.html#rsec44]In the previous chapter we noted that Venice had created a state arsenal, aninstitution that aided in the swift creation of the vast fleet needed totransport the army of the Fourth Crusade. This constitutes one of the mainpillars of Venetian power, with the other two represented by the Doge’spalace—and hence all the mechanisms of the government, the Senate, the GrandCouncil, and, as we shall see below, the notoriously infamous “Council ofTen”—and the bankers of the Rialto, with whom we have not yet dealt. But allthree of these mechanisms of power—the agencies of government, the institutionsof finance, and the implements and agencies of war—were in the hands of the samesmall group of oligarchical families.8 The oligarchical families, and theirfortunes made through trade and banking, are the real nerve center of Venetianpower, and to them we now turn.3. The Venetian Oligarchical Families [Contents.html#rsec45]The oligarchical families of Venice are divided into two classes, the Long-hi,i.e., the families of ancient provenance that could claim, and prove, theirlines of noble status prior to the year 1000, and the Curti, newer families whohad acquired wealth and status within the Republic, and which, beginning in1382, were admitted into the ranks of the nobility and thus became eligible tohold offices of government, including that of Doge. As Webster Tarpley notes,the Longhi included the Dandolo, Michiel, Morosini, Contarini, and Giustinianfamilies.9 The newer families included the Mocenigo, Loredan, Dona, and Trevisanfamilies, among others.10Within the Venetian state, the principle means of government was the Dogeshipand the Grand Council, membership of which was restricted to the male members ofthese noble families, a body which grew to some 2,000 members by 1500,11 a factof great importance, as we shall discover when we turn to a consideration of theestablishment of the notorious Council of Ten. In any case, the upper house ofthis Grand Council was the Pregadi, in effect the Venetian Senate, whichoversaw—until the establishment of the Council of Ten—foreign affairs and theappointment of Venetian ambassadors.12The Great Council was, in effect, the apex of the “self-perpetuatingoligarchy”13 that was Venice: From the start the Council had been self-electing; thus,inevitably over the years, it had grown more and more into a closed society. In1293, to give but one instance, it included ten Foscari, eleven Morosini and noless than eighteen Contarini.14By 1298, the oligarchy had succeeded in passing a law in this Council thatessentially restricted membership to those families that had previously beenrepresented on it, an action that was called the Serrata, literally “thelocking,” an act which “created, at a stroke, a closed caste in the society ofthe Republic; a caste with its own inner elite of those who had sat in the GreatCouncil … ”15 To ensure security against any false claims to nobility that mightbe advanced to gain a seat on this council, the Republic created the Librod’Oro, the Golden Book, essentially a state census of all who were eligiblewithin Venice for such a seat, in other words, a kind of Venetian Burke’sPeerage, a registry of all nobility.16This reflects a typical obsession of the Venetian oligarchical families: ethnicpurity, a policy of strict segregation between the subject peoples of the empireand the Venetians themselves.17 We may speculate here that this policy may alsohave been in part to protect and preserve the knowledge among those families oftheir ancient Roman imperial, and ultimately Babylonian origins, as outlined atthe beginning of the previous chapter. Such knowledge, if it existed, had to bepreserved and also restricted to those families. Nor is this a fancifulspeculation, since the Venetian oligarchical families obviously are obsessedwith the preservation of their line.In this respect, it is worth pausing to note that one of these Venetian noblehouses, the House of Guelf-Este (or, to give it its German variant, Welf-Este),ruled over Padua and Verona as virtual Venetian satraps.18 This house, as weshall see in subsequent chapters, is significant to the story of the transfer ofthe oligarchy northward into German and, eventually, into England.4. The Suppression of Factional Infighting [Contents.html#rsec46]It is quite crucial to notice what the Great Council really is: the deliberatelycreated body wherein all major familiar or factional interests were representedand given voice. This is an important clue into the nature of the polity ofVenice, namely, that the individual factional or familial interests weredeliberately subordinated to the interests of the oligarchical class as a whole,and “by the ironclad delimitation of noble status to those already noble in 1297and their male descendants, and by continuous terror against the masses andagainst the nobility itself.”19 In other words, the Great Council representedthe mechanism of the suppression of factional infighting, and it is this factorthat in part constitutes one reason for the profound longevity and stability ofthe Venetian state.B. THE COUNCIL OF TEN: TERRORISM AS A MATTER OF STATE POLICY[Contents.html#rsec47]But what of terrorism as a matter of official state policy of the oligarchy?Here we must turn to consider that preeminently and uniquely Venetian symbol andinstrument of terror, the Council of Ten—how it came to be created, and whatpossible influence or precedent the Venetians were drawing upon when theycreated it.We have already noted that by 1500 the Great Council had grown to some 2,000members, all of whom, of course, were members of the Longhi or Curti noblefamilies, thus making it a cumbersome body to deal with a crisis.20 Even longbefore 1500, the Great Council was too bulky and ungainly to deal withemergencies, and this fact led to a typically oligarchical response. Rather thanadjust the existing bodies of state, a new body was created by the Great Councilon July 10, 1310 in response to a local insurrection: the Council of Ten.21 Likeall such bodies, it was originally intended as a temporary body to deal with ashort-term situation, but its charter kept being renewed until, in 1334, it wasmade a permanent body.22 Though its corporate powers were immense, they were subject tocharacteristically Venetian checks and balances to prevent any individualmember’s using them for his personal ends. Election—by the Great Council, fromlists drawn up by itself and the Signoria respectively—was for a single year,and re-election was forbidden until a further year was passed, during which timeany alleged abuses would be carefully investigated. Two members of the samefamily could never sit simultaneously. Furthermore the Council never alloweditself a single head; there were always three—the Capi dei Dieci—serving for amonth at a time, a month during which they were forbidden to go out into societylest they should be exposed to bribes or baseless rumours. Finally—the mostimportant point of all and perhaps the one most frequently forgotten—the Tenwere powerless by themselves. They acted only in concert with the Doge and hissix councillors, bring their effective number to seventeen.23From the outset, the Council of Ten served first to coordinate a vast network ofspies, both inside of and outside of Venice, extending even to the Mongols.24 Itthus coordinated all counter-intelligence and intelligence and police andsurveillance operations both inside and outside the Republic and itsterritories.25 More importantly, it was authorized to decide matters of policyand state in the name of the Great Council, and thus, its decrees had the forceof law of the Great Council itself.26But there was more: Venice’s superb communications and the almost legendary stabilityof her government had made her Europe’s principal centre of espionage, aninternational clearing-house for secrets of state. By now all the principalnations of the world were represented there, by embassies, agencies, banks,trading centres or other more clandestine associations, and for many of them thegathering of intelligence was a primary function. For such purposes extra pairsof eyes and ears were always useful; nor did a skilful hand with a knife or anone-too-sensitive conscience invariable come amiss. It would have been odd if Venice, with an intelligencesystem of her own far more highly developed than that of any foreign power, hadnot maintained a close eye on all these covert activities and, where possible,used them for her own ends. Every embassy, every foreign household even, wasthoroughly penetrated by Venetian agents, reporting directly back to the Tendetails of comings and goings, of letters received and conversations overheard.A special watch was kept on leading courtesans, several of whom were paid by thestate to pass on any information that might prove useful, for blackmail orotherwise. There was also an active network of double agents whose task was tofeed false or misleading information into foreign systems.27In other words, the Council of Ten combined both foreign policy, internalsecurity, international espionage, and a law-making capacity in one body.The ubiquity of this surveillance system, particularly within the territories ofthe Republic itself, meant that “the contents of any discussion among oligarchsor citizens was routinely known to the Ten within twenty-four hours or less,”28and the Doge’s palace was punctuated with numerous mail-slots in the shape oflion’s mouths “marked Per Denontie Segrete (‘For Secret Denunciations’) forthose who wished to call to the attention of the Ten and their monstrousbureaucracy individuals stealing from the state or otherwise violating thelaw.”29Nor was this all.The Council of Ten was empowered to issue bills of capital attainder, and couldthus, like the Star Chamber later in England, conduct secret trial ofindividuals so denounced. Any death sentence issued by the Council was withoutappeal; offenders found guilty were simply rounded up by the Ten’s police,“disappeared” from view, and usually executed (by strangulation) the very sameday their sentence was passed, their bodies hung by the leg in the Piazetta(Tarot enthusiasts, take note!).30 Thus, in addition to being a police,intelligence, counter-intelligence, foreign policy, disinformation, espionageclearing-house and law-making body, the Council of Ten was also a secret andsupreme court, and executioner. Like all such monstrous creations, the Councilsoon encroached on the powers of other government agencies, either by directlyco-opting their powers, or by internal penetration, or both.31There is even some suspicion that the great Italian epic poet Dante Alighieriran afoul of the Council of Ten: Dante visited Venice in 1321, acting in his capacity asdiplomatic representative of the nearby city of Ravenna, whose overlord was fora time his protector. He died shortly after leaving Venice. The two explanationsof his death converge on murder: one version state(s) that he was denied a boatin which to travel south across the lagoon. He was forced to follow a paththrough the swamps, caught malaria, and died. Another version says that a boatwas available, but that to board it would have meant certain assassination.Venetian records regarding this matter have conveniently disappeared.32We may thus once again speculate that when Bruno announced to Mocenigo hisintention to found a secret society based upon Hermetic principles, Mocenigo inturn denounced him to the Ten, which arranged his arrest by the Inquisition, forVenice was implacably opposed to the Neoplatonism and Hermeticism of theRenaissance.33In any case, it is important to recognize the steps of the oligarchy in theestablishment of the Council of Ten, for they have become their classic playbookever since, in states such as England, and in more recent history, the UnitedStates of America: 1) The normal mechanisms of the government are perceived by the oligarchyto be too cumbersome to respond to a sudden crisis; 2) rather than amend or alter those bodies in such a fashion to be ableto respond to such a crisis, new, streamlined agencies or bodies are establishedto represent the original constitutional body, which retains de jure authority,and thus protects the larger interests of the oligarchy; 3) this body becomes—in modern parlance—a “continuity of government”agency, vested with plenary powers of arrest, secret trial, ability to rule bydecree, and the final clearing house of all intelligence and for the analysisthereof; 4) on the basis of this intelligence, this body also becomes apolicy-making body for the state.Additionally, as we saw in the last chapter, ad hoc and “informal discussiongroups”—Venetian versions of the Council on Foreign Relations, or Bilderberggroups—can emerge within this overall structure to discuss policy and itsexecution, such as the Giovani group that once included Bruno. Such groups seekto promote “memes” within the broader culture whose object is to enhance thepower and security of the oligarchy.C. GIAMMARIA ORTES AND THE ORIGIN OF THE CARRYING CAPACITY MYTH, AND OTHEROLIGARCHICAL MEMES [Contents.html#rsec48]In this respect, we must examine the crucial figure of Giammaria Ortes, whomWebster Tarpley, in a significant and magisterial piece of research exposing theorigin of the meme of overpopulation, called “the decadent Venetian kook whooriginated the myth of ‘carrying capacity.’”34 Carrying capacity is simply theidea that the Earth has a maximum population that it can “carry” or support, anidea that, not surprisingly, originated with Venice’s financial oligarchy. This“meme” was the brainchild of one Giammaria Ortes, a “defrocked … monk andlibertine, who in 1790, in the last year of his life, published the raving tract‘Reflections on the Population of Nations in Relation to National Economy.’”35Tarpley observes that the essence of Ortes’ argument is summarized in astatement he made in his work “Della Economia Nazionale” (“On NationalEconomy”): “National economy is a matter which cannot be improved in any way byany particular action, and all attempts by persons seeking to organize nationaleconomy according to a better system, as regards provision or increase of goods,have to end as useless efforts.”36 One notes here a typical oligarchical theme,namely, that any effort to improve economic structure is useless, theimplication being that any advocated systems of change need not be pursed.Ortes followed this up with an argument that readers of Babylon’s Banksters willreadily recognize: But that the general wealth cannot be increased for some withoutan equal deficiency of them for others; that no one can find himself better offwithout some else being worse off, or without somebody’s suffering; that themass of common goods is determined in every nation by the need, and that itcannot exceed this need by even a hairsbreadth, neither by the charms of acharlatan nor by the work of a philosopher nor even by the work of a sovereign …37Notice the three implicit assumptions of a closed system of economics andfinance present in these two quotations: 1) All economies are closed systems; 2) all economies are static systems, that is to say, no new technologicalinnovations can be envisioned which recreate new mechanisms for wealth creation;and hence, 3) all wealth accumulation is also wealth privation: there can be nocreation of wealth, all wealth involves debt.Given these assumptions, it is easy to see why the Neoplatonic and Hermeticinfluences within the Italian Renaissance, with their emphasis on creation ofinformation, and the general fecundity of the underlying physical medium, wereso adamantly opposed by the financial oligarchy of Venice.From these implicit assumptions, it is a short step to the derivation of theidea that the Earth has a maximum population carrying capacity: Hence, derives for Ortes the fixed and unimprovable level of thewealth of each nation, which will always be the product of its populationmultiplied by the irreducible minimum amount of work. Or, as Ortes says: “Having posited this truth, I say again, the substances spreadthroughout a nation and by means of which the nation exists must be determinedprecisely by the needs of the nation, without any abundance or deficiency; so ifwe suppose in any nation some number of persons, they will require certain goodsin order to survive, and the reason for the production of these goods will onlybe precisely providing for these persons. Because however these persons can onlyconsume a determined quantity of goods, these goods cannot fall short or beexcessive in relation to their need, thanks to the fact that if the goods werenot there or were inferior to the needs of all, all those persons would notsurvive, which is contrary to our supposition, and if the goods were excessiveor were superior to the need, then those goods would have been produced andwould be kept without sufficient reason, without which nothing is ever done, aswe pointed out.”38This is a classic definition of a closed system, or, as Tarpley very aptlyobserves, “Ortes has thus preceded John Von Neumann and others in definingeconomic reality as a zero-sum game.”39 Ortes is even more explicit in hisphysics analogy, making comparison between his economic model and a zero-summedvector system: The good therefore, understood as the possession of goods inexcess of what is needed, can only be expressed between the individual and thecommonality as the number zero, and since there is an inevitable lack of goodsfor some if these are to be abundant for others, this good can only appear as amixture of economic good and evil, which tends neither to one nor to the other,or as the vector sum of forces which, operating with equal energy in differentand opposite directions, destroy each other and resolve themselves intonothing.40Lest the reader miss this important point, we state it explicitly: this is oneof the first times in history that the connection between physics and financehas been articulated, and notably, the relationship between the two is one of aclosed, static equilibrium zero-summed model. Absent entirely is the ancientMetaphor of the medium, and its non-equilibrium model of information creation.From this closed system static approach to economic (and physics!) models, andgiven Ortes’ assumption of the lack of technological developments that can openthe system back up, and his implied assumption of fixed unchangeable rates ofproduction flowing from it,41 it is a short step to the conclusion that,inevitably, the Earth must reach a point of maximum population growth.42 Thatmaximum limit Ortes fixed at three billion people, a limit which has obviouslylong since been exceeded.43 Not surprisingly, Ortes recommended that policies beimplemented for zero population growth, including celibacy, prostitution,castration and “other modes of incontinence used by the barbarous nations.”44Hand-in-hand with this zero-population-growth, maximum-carrying-capacity “meme”is the hidden doctrine and allied meme that man has no soul, no consciousness orreasoning capacity.45 Man becomes reduced to a collection of purely materialforces, summing, in Ortes’ model, to zero. Small wonder then, that Venice, inthe name of its basically Aristotelian materialism, waged a constant ideologicalwarfare with the rest of the Italian Renaissance and its Neoplatonic andHermetic impulses, for which virtually everything was a manifestation of thecosmically creative powers of intellect, consciousness, and soul.46 And smallwonder, also, that Bruno, who so epitomized those Hermetic impulses, had to beeliminated, not only for his possible knowledge of Venetian intrigue (as wasseen in the last chapter), but more importantly, for his mastery of the Hermeticsystem, and its powers of soul, intellect, and memory. It is this ideological,epistemological, and cosmological commitment to closed systems of finance andphysics that ultimately lies behind Venice’s long-standing hostility to thehumanist Renaissance of Medici dominated Florence.47There is one final, all-important clue, connecting all these themes and GiordanoBruno to the Venetian oligarchy represented by the Mocenigo family, one of whosemembers (as we know well by now) betrayed Bruno to the Inquisition. During theyears that Ortes was formulating his views, he was “closely associated” with oneof those informal “discussion groups” deliberating on matters of socialphilosophy that we have earlier seen Galileo and Bruno involved with. This wasthe conversazione filosofica e felice, or “philosophical and happy conversationgroup.”48 Notably, one of the members of this oligarchical discussion group—akind of Venetian forerunner to the Council on Foreign Relations or the RoyalInstitute for International Affairs—was the namesake of the Mocenigo who hadfirst sought to acquire Bruno’s art of memory secrets: Alvise Zuanne Mocenigo.49The Venetian oligarchy and its policy and methods were, if nothing else,remarkably consistent.________________________1 Webster Griffin Tarpley, “Venice’s War Against Western Civilization,”Against Oligarchy,http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/venices-war-against-western-civilization[http://http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/venices-war-against-western-civilization],p. 1.2 Norwich, A History of Venice, pp. 641–642.3 Ibid., p. 66.4 Farrell, Babylon’s Banksters, pp. 159-184.5 See Crowley, City of Fortune: How Venice Ruled the Seas, p. 1626 Crowley, City of Fortune, p. 118. Crowley aptly writes, “Venice came intime to call its overseas empire the Stato da Mar, the ‘Territory of the Sea.’With two exceptions, it never comprised the occupation of substantial blocks ofland—the population of Venice was far too small for that—rather it was a loosenetwork of ports and bases, similar in structure to the way stations of theBritish Empire. Venice created its own Gibraltars, Maltas, and Adens, and likethe British Empire it depended on sea power to hold these possessions together.”7 Ibid., p. 232.8 Crowley, City of Fortune: How Venice Ruled the Seas, p. 377.9 Tarpley, “The Venetian Conspiracy,” Against Oligarchy,http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/the-venetian-conspiracy/[http://http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/the-venetian-conspiracy/],p. 3. It is possible, Tarpley also notes, that the Giustinian family was relatedto the East Roman Emperor Justinian I the Great. One factor that makes this apossibility is that Justinian came from Dalmatia, long a region under Venetianinfluence and dominance, and with which Venice maintained trading relationshipsfrom the earliest founding of the settlement in the lagoon.10 Ibid.11 Ibid.12 Tarpley, “The Venetian Conspiracy,”http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/the-venetian-conspiracy[http://http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/the-venetian-conspiracy],p. 4.13 Norwich, A History of Venice, p. 182.14 Ibid., p. 183.15 Ibid., pp. 183–184.16 Ibid., p. 184.17 Crowley, City of Fortune, p. 183.

Tarpley notes something quite crucial: “Since the Venetianoligarchy relied for its survival on the secret weapon of political intelligencemanipulation, its primary strategic targets were first and foremost dictated byepistemological rather than military criteria. Fleets and armies, even in thehands of a powerful and aggressive enemy state, could well redound to Venetianadvantage. The real danger was a hostile power that developed epistemologicaldefenses against manipulation and deceit. In the face of such a threat, Venicedid, and does—kill. “The Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth and sixteenthcenturies, perhaps the greatest outpouring of human creativity in history,represented such a threat to the Serene Republic, and in a more concentratedform than it had ever faced before. The threat arose from the epistemologicalwarfare and alliance system of the great Cosimo de’ Medici of Florence and hissuccessors. Venice mobilized every resource at its disposal to destroy theRenaissance. After decades of sabotage, going to far as to arrange the ravagingof Italy by foreign armies, Venice succeeded.” This epistemological warfare was, as we saw in Chapter Two[Chapter002.html], the threat posed to the financial-religious oligarchy ofVenice, accustomed as it was to Aristotle, by the Hermetic and Neoplatonic viewsof the Renaissance that were, in particular, sponsored by the Florentines, andwhich culminated in Bruno’s expression of the ancient metaphor.34 Tarpley, “Giammaria Ortes: The Decadent Venetian Kook Who Originated theMyth of ‘Carrying Capacity,’”http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/giammaria-ortes-the-decadent-venetian-kook-who-originated-the-myth-of-carrying-capacity/[http://http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/giammaria-ortes-the-decadent-venetian-kook-who-originated-the-myth-of-carrying-capacity/]35 Ibid.36 Ibid., p. 7.37 Ibid.38 Ibid., p. 8.39 Ibid.40 Ibid., emphasis added.41 Ibid., p. 10.42 Ibid., pp. 9–10.43 Ibid., p. 1o.44 Ibid., p. 11.45 Tarpley, “Venice’s War Against Western Civilization,” p. 6.46 Ibid., p. 3.47 Tarpley, “The Venetian Conspiracy,” p. 1.48 Tarpley, “Giammaria Ortes,” p. 2.49 Ibid., p. 3."},{"pageContent":"[images/chap.jpg][images/chap.jpg] Fíve [Contents.html#rch5][images/chap1.jpg][images/chap1.jpg]CONCLUSIONS TO PART ONE [Contents.html#rch5][images/bull3a.jpg]“If any one individual symbolizes the tormented history of the Hermetictradition it is Giordano Bruno.”1“But Bruno was, in reality, a martyr for the Hermetic Tradition.”2—Lynn Picknett and Clive PrinceIT HAS BEEN A LONG JOURNEY from the fires that roasted Giordano Bruno throughthe soaring heights of his cosmology and arts of memory, through theimplications of the ancient Topological Metaphor of the Medium, to the rise ofthe Republic of Venice and the cunning and brutality of its byzantineinstitutions, its oligarchy, and its mechanistic, closed-system cosmologicalviews, reflected in its static view of wealth and physics. But we are at last ina position to summarize our results thus far: 1) The motivations for Bruno’s murder by Venice and the Papacy aretwo-fold: a) Bruno was murdered because there is a possibility he was aVenetian agent. In support of this possibility, we have in the previous pagesnoted the following things: i) As was pointed out in Chapter One [Chapter001.html], whenBruno fled the Kingdom of Naples for northern Italy—Padua and Venice—he hadalready explicitly and openly disavowed Catholic dogmas and practice, such asthe deity of Christ and the veneration of relics and images of the saints. It issignificant in light of Bruno’s subsequent denunciation for heresy to theInquisition by Mocenigo that Bruno was not denounced for clearly heretical viewson his first visit to Venice. This implies that he was possibly under protectionfrom Venice during his first visit. ii) Bruno’s subsequent travels to Geneva, Paris, Oxford,London, and Germany took him to the heart of all the religious controversies ofthe day. Since Venice had made a goal of publishing both Protestant and Catholicworks during his lifetime, and since through Venetian efforts the Index ofProhibited Books and the Jesuit Order were established, the possibility arisesthat Bruno’s travels throughout Protestant and Catholic Europe may have been inservice of this typically Venetian dual agenda. Additionally, as was noted,Bruno did take part in the many “informal discussion” groups in Venice prior tohis first departure from that city, discussion groups which included members ofthe oligarchical Mocenigo family. iii) Mocenigo’s subsequent contact with Bruno while the latterwas in Frankfurt also suggests that Bruno’s whereabouts were being closelyfollowed by Venetian spies in the service of the Council of Ten. The very factof Bruno’s contact with that powerful Venetian oligarchical family indicatesthat Bruno was of extreme interest to the oligarchy. iv) Therefore, Bruno’s subsequent acceptance of Mocenigo’sinvitation to return to Venice to teach him his art of memory system is nolonger a mystery, for Bruno might have assumed the latter’s protection wasassured, based on his prior contact with that family during his first Venetiansojourn and participation in the discussion group. v) Bruno’s revelation to Mocenigo that he intended to found asecret society—the Giordanistas—in Europe to promote his Hermetic philosophy asa religion to replace both Protestantism and Catholicism ran counter to theVenetian agenda of fomenting religious conflict between the two camps, and thus,for this reason alone, Bruno would have posed a threat to Venice’s agenda.Additionally, this may have been seen as Bruno’s betrayal of whatever possibleassignment he had been originally given as a possible Venetian agent. Thequestion then arises of why Bruno was not simply strangled in a privateexecution, as was customary for the methods of the Council of Ten. The answermay be that because of his notoriety, and the possibility that he had alreadyfounded his secret society, a more public message had to be sent to any possibleadherents of that society. b) Bruno was murdered for the threat his Hermetic views and systemof memory posed to the oligarchical financial elite of Venice and to thereligious elite of the Papacy: i) As was seen in Chapters One [Chapter001.html] and Two[Chapter002.html], Bruno’s Hermeticism implied that there was an “originaltheology” or prisca theologia stemming from Ancient Egypt that was “more true”than either Judaism or Christianity, and, by implication, Islam. As such, Bruno,like many Renaissance humanists and Hermeticists of his day, viewed Christiandoctrine—especially the Resurrection and Trinity—as disguised elements ofEgyptian religion. Bruno went further than most during his day and advocated thecomplete abolition of Christianity, a position that brought him into conflictwith the oligarchical powers of Venice and the religious powers of the Papacy.Additionally, Hermeticism claimed, as we saw, to be a continuation ofantediluvian knowledge; ii) By taking this position, Bruno also pointed out that thecharacter of Yahweh was morally contradictory, and one, moreover, that was ananthropomorphic projection of humanity itself. He advocated a return to the Godof the Metaphor, to which all men, without the need of special revelation ordivinely sanctioned institutional structures such as the Church, could, throughthe powers of reason, have access. Again, this brought him into direct conflictwith the financial and religious powers of his day, and for these reasons, bothVenice and the Papacy colluded to have him murdered in a public fashion thatwould “send a message” to anyone similarly tempted; iii) Additionally, Bruno’s Hermeticism, as we saw, made him—inhis own words—a “citizen of the world,” a position of political as well asreligious “egalitarianism” that conflicted directly with the political andreligious institutions of his day, and that anticipated, as we saw, the views ofthe subsequent Bavarian Illuminati and the revolutionary movements of the lateeighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; iv) As we also discovered, in the implications of theTopological Metaphor of the Physical Medium, and particularly in Bruno’sexposition of it, mankind itself is, to a certain extent, the “common surface”of the differentiated “regions” of the medium, with the medium, and thereforeman, to that extent becoming symbols of the alchemical Philosophers’ Stone, thetransmutative, information-creating medium. In Bruno’s view, this means thatmind or soul is a non-local phenomenon binding all things together and makingpossible the practice of magic through the bringing of the mind into harmonywith universal archetypes based on astrological principles; v) As we also noted, the Metaphor is a metaphor of fecundity,of the creation of information that is, in a word, debt free and open andavailable to all. This explicit implication of the Metaphor and the generalNeoplatonic and Hermetic impulse of the Italian Renaissance was a clear threatto the closed-systems Aristotelian materialism of Venetian oligarchs, for whomwealth was a zero-sum, debt-encumbered system, as we discovered in the thoughtof Giammaria Ortes. Lest this point be missed, it is best to restate it in moremodern terms: for both Bruno and the Hermeticists, and for the Venetianfinancial oligarchy, there is a clear and explicit connection between the typesof systems of finance being advocated, and the cosmological and physics systemsbeing advocated. In this context it will be recalled that Ortes formulated hissociological meme of carrying capacity and zero population growth as not only azero-sum game but a zero-summed vector field, implying a clear physics model. Wemay therefore view Ortes as being the first modern “econophysicist.” Byemphasizing the principle of fecundity in the Metaphor, Bruno and otherRenaissance humanists were a threat to the entire mercantilist financial system; vi) In Bruno’s version of the Metaphor, as noted, there is adirect connection between memory, mind, astrology, alchemy, and the physicalmedium. Here we may speculate on another possible reason for the sudden Venetianoligarchical “about face” with respect to Bruno. In chapter three[Chapter003.html], we noted that Venetian oligarchical families may have in factdescended from Chaldean slaves brought to Italy from Mesopotamia during theRoman Empire. In Babylon’s Banksters, I noted that financial and economic cyclesappear in some sense to be coordinated to planetary positions, an essentiallyastrological notion, and that this knowledge of the coupling of financial withphysical systems may have been a declined legacy of a high science passed downfrom High Antiquity, and a closely-held secret of the temple elites ofBabylonia. Thus, it is a possibility that such knowledge was passed downprecisely in these families to medieval times. With his statements to Mocenigothat he intended to found a secret society based on his Hermetic principles,Bruno would have been threatening to end the possible monopoly of this closelyheld secret by those families, and hence had to be permanently silenced; vii) This possibility of hidden and suppressed knowledgebecame evident in our exploration in a different way, for as we have seen, someaccount has to be made for why the Italian Renaissance so suddenly exploded withknowledge of Neoplatonic and Hermetic texts. We suggested that this occurredthrough access to the imperial archives of Constantinople, access possibly givento Florence through the participation of Byzantine humanists in the Churchreunion Council of Ferrara-Florence, and also possibly through Venice’s sackingof Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, which would have provided access toarchival information, some of which may ultimately stemmed from the ancientLibrary of Alexandria. We noted the possibility that this may have includedancient maps clearly depicting the New World, and alternate trade routes to theFar East bypassing the Venetian stranglehold and trading monopoly on the EasternMediterranean. In such a circumstance, Venice would have chosen to suppress notonly any Hermetic cosmological knowledge it recovered from Constantinople, butalso any geographic and cartographic knowledge. As we shall discover in chapternine [Chapter009.html], there is evidence that such cartographic knowledge didindeed exist, and that it was a closely held secret during the Middle Ages priorto the discovery of the New World by Columbus; viii) With respect to the Metaphor, we also observed that inthe Vedic and Christian trinitarian versions, the Metaphor creates not only aninitial triadic structure but also the implicit categories of persons,functions, and nature, with persons being closely associated with peculiarfunctions. This is, as we shall encounter in the next part of this book, thebasis for the rise of the doctrine of the corporate person in theology andjurisprudence; ix) Finally, we noted that the Metaphor is always of aboth/and dialectical nature, having both theistic and atheistic interpretations,personal and impersonal interpretations, and that all are necessary to maintainin order for a full understanding of the Metaphor and its implications. We notedalso that in its original understanding, the Metaphor is one of fecundity, andnot tied to notions of debt and sacrifice. 2) With respect to Venice itself, we noted the following classic andtelltale signs of the operations and methods of oligarchical imperialism andfinancial mercantilism, each of which, again, is directly threatened by theopposing epistemology of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism: a) With respect to Venetian history, we noted that there are threepossible ways that it is connected with ancient Mesopotamia, two of these viasymbolism, and one of them via actual physical descent: i) The first symbolic connection is through the winged lion ofSt. Mark, Venice’s patron saint. The winged lion, as we saw, ultimately derivesfrom Babylonia; ii) The second symbolic connection is more tenuous, via themonastery of San Giorgio Maggiore in the Venetian lagoon. The image of St Georgeon a stead killing a dragon with a spear is similar to Mesopotamian and Egyptianimages; iii) The third, and most important, connection to Babylonia isvia the possible descent of Venetian oligarchical families from Mesopotamianslaves brought to Rome. As noted above, it is possible these families preservedthe knowledge of the connection between planetary alignments and financial andeconomic cycles. As also noted, these Venetian oligarchical families took greatpains to protect their racial and ethnic purity from “contamination” by subjectpeoples in their Empire; b) The Venetian connection to Byzantium and the heavy Byzantineinfluence on its culture and institutions was also noted, and this influence, wenow note, extended to its methods of intelligence gathering, influence building,and empire building. These methods included: i) A consistent policy of mercantilism, evident in theobtaining of special trading privileges and tax exemptions for the Byzantineempire; ii) Use of obfuscation in military expeditions, as in thepossible cover story of the Fourth Crusade being to expel the Muslims from theHoly land, when a certain amount of evidence suggests that Constantinople, atleast as far as Venice was concerned, was the original goal of the expedition.Venetian intelligence would, for example, have known of Alexius Angelicus’presence in Germany and of his claims to the Byzantine imperial throne. iii) Duplicitous secret diplomacy and intrigue was practicedat all times, as, for example, in the aforementioned Fourth Crusade, when Venicewas negotiating simultaneously with the French Knights to lead an expeditionwhich they thought ultimately targeted Egypt, while concurrently negotiatingwith the Viceroy in Egypt to guarantee that no attack on Egypt was forthcoming.This, again, is evidence that Venice’s goals during the Crusade may have beenConstantinople all along. Similarly, as we have noted, Venice promoted both theCatholic and Protestant cause during the Reformation, with a view to fomentingcrisis and war in order to begin the transfer of its center of operations fromthe lagoon northward, to a new strategic base with access to the Atlantic trade; iv) The Byzantine influence and oligarchical method is alsoevident in the creation of the notorious Council of Ten, which combined thefunctions of foreign policy-making, legislation, trial, intelligence andcounter-intelligence gathering and analysis, disinformation, assassination, andso on. In this, the Council of Ten resembles the Byzantine Empire’s Bureau ofBarbarians, which combined similar functions. The fact that this Council wascreated with explicit controls designed to keep it in the hands of theoligarchical families is testament to its utility to their designs and security.In short, terrorism was an official state policy; v) The oligarchy similarly promoted the idea of the closedsystem of physics and wealth as a zero-sum game, as we saw with Giammaria Ortes.This becomes a major identifying factor in all oligarchical meme-promotion eversince, and it is therefore an identifying marker of the fact that Venetianoligarchical methods have survived to our own day; vi) Similarly, as we have also noted, the oligarchy would haveto suppress any epistemological, cosmological system or any other knowledgethreatening that closed-system approach, and this would have included—and doesinclude—cartographic knowledge. vii) The oligarchical method of empire included, as we havealso discovered, two important points, namely the willingness to transfer thecenter of operation if the situation arises, and secondly, the promotion ofempire by the maintenance of bases and ports of call that allow for the swiftprojection of military power and the protection of trading interests. Thesemethods, too, have survived from the collapse of Venice, through the foundingand dissolution of the British Empire, and the founding and rise of America asan empire.With these thoughts in mind, we are now ready to take the plunge into the murkyworld of medieval finance and banking, the rise of corporations, and thelittle-known story of the possible real reasons that the New World wasdiscovered. But before we can do all that, we must first look back, once again,to ancient times, and their understanding of money and the Metaphor, as well asa little-known hidden “Hermetic” hand in the promotion of the former, andpreservation of the latter …________________________1 Picknett and Prince, The Forbidden Universe, p. 341.2 Ibid., p. 342."},{"pageContent":"II [Contents.html#rpt2]MONETIZING THE METAPHOR, AND THE PYRAMID OF POWER [Contents.html#rpt2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- “Italian bankers ultimately managed to free themselves from the threat ofexpropriation by themselves taking over governments, and by doing so, acquiringtheir own court systems (capable of enforcing contracts) and even morecritically, their own armies.”—David Graeber,Debt: The First 5,000 Years, p. 291."},{"pageContent":"[images/chap.jpg][images/chap.jpg] Six [Contents.html#rch6][images/chap1.jpg][images/chap1.jpg]RETROSPECTIVES ON THE TOPOLOGICAL METAPHOR AND MONEY: Brahma, Buddha, Babylon,and Greece [Contents.html#rch6][images/bull3a.jpg]“… theories of existential debt always end up becoming ways of justifying—orlaying claim to—structures of authority.”—David Graeber1IN THIS CHAPTER, we will encounter the extraordinarily brilliant and insightfulwork of two scholars of the subject of money, who approach the subject not fromthe standpoint of standard economic or numismatic history but from classicalliterature (Richard Seaford), and anthropology and cultural history (DavidGraeber). If there were two books that I would recommend to readers for furtherstudy, it would be Seaford’s Money and the Early Greek Mind, and Graeber’s Debt:The First 5,000 Years.That said, we shall here seek to place their work within the wider metaphysicaland cosmological context of the ancient Topological Metaphor, for in doing so, avery different picture of the relationships between money and cosmologicalphysics emerges. To summarize this relationship as we have encountered it thusfar, we would have to say that there is a direct and analogical connectionbetween the way the medieval world of Europe viewed money and the way it viewedthe cosmos, as we saw in the case of Giammaria Ortes and Venice. The questionnow becomes: What was the order of concepts? Did the rise of money influence thecosmology? Or was the converse true, did cosmology influence the view of money?As we shall see, Seaford argues that money influenced the rise of philosophicalcosmology in ancient Greece. But as we shall also discover, there areindications in Seaford’s own research that the converse is true, that cosmologynot only influenced the view of money, but that there were possibly hiddenhands, in the form of secret societies and mystery schools, namelyPythagoreanism, that played a significant role.But first, we must look even farther back in history to the ancient world beforeGreece, and to the unusual views of money and cosmology that it maintained.A. DEBT, SACRIFICE, AND THE METAPHOR: [Contents.html#rsec49]1. Primordial Debt Theory: Brahmanism, Babylon, and Buddhism[Contents.html#rsec50]One of the ancient Brahmanic texts, the Satapatha Brahmana, states, “In beingborn every being is born as debt owed to the gods, the saints, the Fathers andto men.”2 The Rig Veda likewise alludes to this primordial debt theory, and itsrole in Hinduism’s view of the material world as a form of illusion, when itstates, “Let us drive away the evil effects of bad dreams, just as we pay offdebts.”3 As Graeber observes, the earliest Vedic texts, which date fromapproximately 1500 to 1200 B.C., show a consistent “concern with debt—which istreated as synonymous with guilt and sin.”4 To put it in terms that I firstproposed in The Grid of the Gods, the metaphor has been transformed, by someprocess of reasoning, from a Metaphor of fecundity—the “Corn God”—to one ofdebt, guilt, and sacrifice—“the Blood God”.5 This idea has given rise in moderneconomic theory to “Primordial Debt Theory,” which maintains that this idea ofinterpreting the Metaphor is not unique to Vedic texts, but is rather auniversal phenomenon “essential to the very nature and history of humanthought.”6 Needless to say, most of those promoting this idea have someconnection to the contemporary financial and banking oligarchies, and one isonce again confronted by what Webster Tarpley called the epistemological warfarebeing waged by financial oligarchies, and the meme they wish to implant that“debt is primordial; there is no escaping it.” The implication of this view, asGraeber correctly points out, is that if our lives “are on loan then who wouldactually wish to repay a debt?” To repay it would mean annihilation. Nihilismis, in other words, the inevitable logical consequence of this view.7However, as Graeber points out through numerous details scattered throughout hisbook, there is no historical nor necessary philosophical reason that this is so.In short, such a view is simply untrue.While the complexities of Graeber’s book are far beyond the scope of this book,we may gain some approximation of the importance of “primordial debt theory” forcurrent theorists from the following quotation by one of its major proponents,Bruno Théret, in his significantly-titled article “The Socio-Cultural Dimensionsof the Currency: Implications for the Transition to the Euro,” written for theJournal of Consumer Policy in 1999: At the origin of money we have a “relation of representation” ofdeath as an invisible world, before and beyond life—a representation that is theproduct of the symbolic function proper to the human species and which envisagesbirth as an original debt incurred by all men, a debt owing to the cosmic powersfrom which humanity emerged. Payment of this debt, which can however never be settledon earth—because its full reimbursement is out of reach—takes the form ofsacrifices which, by replenishing the credit of the living, make it possible toprolong life and even in certain cases to achieve eternity by joining the Gods.But this initial belief-claim is also associated with the emergence of sovereignpowers whose legitimacy resides in their ability to represent the entireoriginal cosmos. And it is these powers that invented money as a means ofsettling debts—a means whose abstraction makes it possible to resolve thesacrificial paradox by which putting to death becomes the permanent means ofprotecting life.8It is precisely here that viewing the Metaphor as a declined legacy from ascientifically advanced culture in High Antiquity—that is, viewing the Metaphorshorn of its metaphysical and religious language, and solely from the standpointof a formally explicit topological-mathematical-physics metaphor—reveals itsutility, for when viewed in that way, absolutely no notion of debt is implied atall, moral, financial, or otherwise. Why this is so is readily apparent, for theabstract language of mathematics conveys the concepts without the connotationsthat normal language inevitably entails.Additionally, as we have seen, even in certain versions of the Metaphor—theHermetic for example—no notion of debt or of death is implied in that stage ofinitial differentiation, for at that level, the Metaphor is chiefly and uniquelya Metaphor of life, fecundity, and creation. By construing it as a Metaphor ofdebt and sacrifice, however, Théret does point out one important culturalconsequence in human history, namely, the creation of elite powers,institutions, and authority structures that claimed an exclusive right torepresent the Metaphor in its interpretation as debt, and therefore, to createfinancial and religious systems based upon and powered by the analogicallyparallel idea of sacrifice and debt. What Théret is in effect saying is that itis in this twisting that the notion of the divine right of kings arises. Graeberhimself notices and comments on precisely this point: The ingenious move of course is to fold this back into the statetheory of money—since by “sovereign powers” Théret actually means “the state.”The first kings were sacred kings who were either gods in their own right orstood as privileged mediators between human beings and the ultimate forces thatgoverned the cosmos. This sets us on a road to the gradual realization that ourdebt to the gods was always, really, a debt to the society that made us what weare.9Note what has happened: the Metaphor has first been reinterpreted from ametaphor of life, information creation, and fecundity—an open system—to ametaphor of death, debt, sacrifice, and monetized debt created by aself-authorized elite—a closed system.Consequently, it comes as no surprise that within the Indo-European family oflanguages words for “sin” and “guilt” are often etymologically related to wordsindicating money and debt.10 The problem with the whole primordial debt theory,at least as far as its contemporary theorists (who are attempting to derive itfrom Vedic texts) are concerned, is that even here, repayment of such a debtimplies that the parties in the transaction are equal—that mankind and God orthe Gods are equal.11 Additionally, if the primordial debt theory were true,then the repayment of debt owed to the Gods and/or state would be in the form oftaxation, but ancient societies did not normally tax their citizens.12 As weshall discover, revenues were raised largely by tribute extorted or expropriatedfrom conquered and subjected peoples, which gave rise to what Graeber calls the“military-coinage-slavery” complex. It is the implied equality of God or theGods and mankind that makes the idea of sacrifice an impossibility, an illicitinterpretation of the Metaphor, since even sacrifice implies transaction, andtransaction implies the subtle ontological parity of the parties in theexchange.A glance back at the formal mathematical notation of the Metaphor will show whythis is so. As we saw in chapter two [Chapter002.html], the initialdifferentiation leads to a one-three structure, a triadic or trinitarianstructure of the first derivatives. There, we explored the Metaphor in terms ofmathematician George Spencer-Brown’s Laws of Form, and ended with two regionsjoined by a common surface. Let us recall what we said in chapter two[Chapter002.html]:  Draw a distinction.  Call it the first distinction.  Call the space in which it is drawn the spacesevered or cloven by the distinction.  Call the parts of the space shaped by theseverance or cleft the sides of the distinction or, alternatively, the spaces,states, or contents distinguished by the distinction.  Let any mark, token, or sign be taken in any waywith or with regard to the distinction as a signal.  Call the use of any signal its intent.13Now let us imagine that we envision an indescribable “No-thing,” as weenvisioned in the first chapter, utterly devoid of any distinguishing featureswhatsoever, infinitely “extended” in every “direction.” We might envision it asthe empty space in this box, except of course, our box has no neat linesdenoting its “edges”:[images/f0125-01.jpg]We have, in other words, an infinitely extended “No-thing” which, as we noted inthe first chapter, has a perfect mathematical symbol, the empty hyper-set,symbolized by Ø, to describe it, or as Spencer-Brown calls it, a mark or“signal” of intention.Now, within this space, we draw the simplest distinction: we cleave this space:[images/f0126-01.jpg]Remembering that our “box” really has no “edges,” what we really have is this:[images/f0126-02.jpg]In other words, we have two “spaces,” all that inside the circle, and alloutside of it, or, in other words, we have what Spencer-Brown calls a “clovenspace.” Note that the circle is a circumscription, a “writing around” or“peri-graphing,” which would be functionally symbolized by the paragraph symbol,¶, as a symbol of the function of “drawing a distinction” or “cleaving thespace.”Note two important things here: (1) we are dealing both with a “space” in theintellectual or conceptual sense, and (2) with a space in the real physicssense, at one and the same time. Additionally, because our original “box” isinfinite, the circle or cloven space within it itself has no limits, save thatthere is a boundary or “side” as Spencer-Brown calls it, a surface as thetopologists would say, between it and the space outside it. So we may assignsymbols or marks to each of the three things now distinguished: 1) the space outside the circle we will designate as the “interior” ofspace 1, with the interior denoted by the topological “o” superscript above thesignal or symbol Ø:[images/f0126-03.jpg] 2) and similarly the space inside the circle as space 2, another“interior”:[images/f0127-01.jpg] 3) and the common surface of the two, denoted by the partial derivativesymbol ∂:[images/f0127-02.jpg]Notice that what we now have, as a result of performing one act of distinction,are three “distinguished nothings.” We have created a metaphor of a “one-three,”a kind of primordial trinity. Notably, because our original Ø was dimensionlessor infinite, we cannot assign any real dimensionality to any of the entitiesthus distinguished either.14 Notice the all-important point that the signatureof Ø will always remain in the formal description of the regions or surfaces nomatter how many times the process is repeated. It remains in all contexts, andis thus a basis for analogical connections between all entities subsequentlygenerated by repetitions of this process. One might view this as a kind of“formally explicit calculus of inter-contextual analysis,” or, in short,analogical calculus.If we were to formally notate with the use of the “peri-graphing” symbol ¶ thisfunction, we would write a simple mapping function of this first set ofderivatives as follows:[images/f0127-03.jpg]with each of the three resultants on the right side of the mapping representingthe two regions, and their common surface, respectively.If one imagines repeating this process again, say, to the common surface, todivide it into two or more surfaces, one would end with what topologists andmathematicians would call a second derivative, which is symbolized by thesuperscripted “2” in the following notations, which would then look somethinglike this:[images/f0127-04.jpg]Obviously, this “second derivative” is not equivalent nor identical to theoriginal. At some point, where mankind emerges in this process, one might viewit as an “nth” derivative, and so on, again, clearly not equivalent or identicalto the previous derivatives in the process. The equating of subsequentderivatives thus implied in the idea of debt and sacrifice is thus a massivemisinterpretation of the formal characteristics of the Metaphor, and hence, asGraeber rightly observes, the selection of simply the Vedic texts to justify“primordial debt theory” ignores other texts which do not contain this falseequation, and thus prejudices the case and begs the question.15The notation above also hints at why the notion of debt would be so easilyattached to the Metaphor, for a careful contemplation of its symbolism willdisclose that each description of subsequent derivatives from the initialNothing depends on the prior process; each description is dependent on priorprocesses, and that purely formal, algorithmic, and ontological dependency caneasily be twisted into the idea of indebtedness, whereas the formal descriptionis just that, a means of discerning between differentiated “No-things” withinthe overall analogical process, and nothing more.Indeed, as Greaber also points out, by the late Brahmanic period and just priorto the appearance of the Buddha—who took the last step in repudiating the wholeidea of the Metaphor as debt—the notion was already being circulated that thedebt did not even exist because … one is not in fact separate to begin with,(a notion that is implied by the constant appearance of the first No-thing, orØ, in all subsequent derivative expressions) and hence that the very notion of canceling the debt, andachieving a separate autonomous existence, was ridiculous from the start. Oreven that the very presumption of positing oneself as separate from humanity orthe cosmos, so much so that one can enter into one-to-one dealings with it, isitself the crime that can be answered only by death. Our guilt is not due to thefact that we cannot repay our debt to the universe. Our guilt is our presumptionin thinking of ourselves as being in any sense an equivalent to Everything Elsethat Exists or Has Ever Existed, so as to be able to conceive of such a debt inthe first place. Or let us look at the other side of the equation. Even ifit is possible to imagine ourselves as standing in a position of absolute debtto the cosmos, or to humanity, the next question becomes: Who exactly has aright to speak for the cosmos, or humanity, to tell us how that debt must berepaid? If there’s anything more preposterous than claiming to stand apart fromthe entire universe so as to enter into negotiations with it, it is claiming tospeak for the other side.16This is precisely the claim that the Three Great Yahwist monotheisms make, andtwo of them do so, let it be remembered, in the name of great sacrificialsystems. Moreover, as we shall see, the Papacy in particular claims to speak forit in a unique way, a way that enables it to adjust the cosmic account books.But more of that later.For the moment, we must consider that primordial No-thing which we havedesignated by the empty-hyperset Ø. It will be noted that each and everyconceivable derivative adds or grafts more and more information around it, tobetoken specific instantiations of it. It thus came—within Vedic India, AncientEgypt, the rise of philosophical rationalism in Greece, and, of course, in theNeoplatonists and Hermetica that so profoundly influenced the Renaissancehumanists—to stand for the primordial substance, the physical medium, or God,Him/It-self. It could, as we shall see below in the Greek philosophers, bemodified through a process of “applied alchemical stress,” whether that stresswas “being heated, cooled, combined, divided, compressed, extended, or set inmotion,”17 give rise to the entire diversified cosmos and each individual thingin it, and it “was also that into which all those forms would eventuallydissolve.”18 In this, it was that transmutative “gold” of the Philosophers’Stone of the alchemists.19Eventually, of course, recognition of the basic nature of the Metaphor led Hindulaw to drastically proscribe the notion of debt peonage,20 and to other novelapproaches to circumvent the “debt” misreading of the Metaphor. One of these,which arose in Buddhist monasteries in early medieval China, is the notion that,because the Metaphor is indeed a Metaphor of inexhaustible fecundity andcreativity, it creates an “inexhaustible treasury” from which one candraw—through the proper Buddhist authorities of course—a spiritual “credit” tocancel one’s (or even one’s relatives’) spiritual debts.21 This, westerners willrecognize, is almost the exact same doctrine as the Papacy’s “Treasury ofMerit,” wherein the infinite sacrifice of Christ abolishes all spiritual debt,and the merits of the saints add to that a surplus of “spiritual credits” uponwhich the Papacy can make “withdrawals” in the form of indulgences that remit ormitigate temporal punishments for sins in purgatory.There is, as we implied in previous paragraphs, yet another misreading of theMetaphor, one we encountered in the citation from Bruno Théret, namely, that thefirst No-Thing from which, in the view of the Metaphor, all things derive, isDeath, i.e., the absolute annihilation of “otherness.” Within the Buddhist, andindeed, later Hindu repudiation of the “debt” reading of this Metaphor, therepudiation consists precisely in nihilism, in the absolute repudiation of all“otherness,” including the individual person or “I” at the center of humanbeings’ consciousness.22 In this, too, there is a misreading of the both/andquality of the Metaphor, and of its direction or vector in time, which isprecisely toward diversity, a diversity wherein the signature of the originalNo-Thing always remains in any formal description of derivatives deriving fromit. If one takes that original Ø as connoting a substrate of “Self” orPersonhood, then the formal notation makes it clear that it is a fecundsituation both of one “Self” and many “Selves,” rather than a system ofnihilism.This fecundity, as the Metaphor was explored in terms of its monetaryimplications, eventually led to the system of state-created fiat papermoney—money that was essentially debt-free—in medieval China, where the Bureauof Exchange Medium23 was created to issue notes in 1023. Obviously the systemled to inflation, and periodically the notes would have to be recalled andre-issued.24 As Graeber observes, there is a harsh lesson here for “Metallists,”who are prone to argue that fiat money, when backed by nothing but “statepower,” eventually collapses, for this period in China, which prevailed untilthe seventeenth century, is understood to be “the most economically dynamic inChinese history.”25 The problem, really, with China’s period of inflation underthis system was that the money supply was inflated beyond the demands of themarket, not in the system itself. Even the Buddhist monasteries in Chinagradually broke from the influence of “metallism,” or bullion and coinage, andfunctioned under a system of extension of virtual credit.26With these considerations in mind, it is when we turn to ancient Sumeria thatthings begin to get even more interesting.2. Sumeria, The Breaking of the Tablets and the Jubilee: Pressing the“Reset/Reboot” Button [Contents.html#rsec51]Greaber begins his discussion of the system of credit and finance in ancientSumeria by observing that the name Ur itself is a word that means,simultaneously, “liver, spleen, heart, soul, bulk, main body, foundation, loan,obligation, interest, surplus, profit, interest-bearing debt, repayment,” andfinally “slave-woman.”27 Indeed, that really does not even come close to all thepossible uses of the phoneme ur within the complex of Mesopotamian languages,but for our purposes it affords a convenient port of entry, notwithstanding someinaccuracies that arise from it.Indeed, while primordial debt theorists often appeal to the ancient Vedic texts,they appear to be curiously reluctant to do so with respect to Sumer orBabylonia, a fact made more curious because it was precisely in Sumer andBabylon that the practice of lending money at interest apparently began, almosttwo thousand years before any Vedic text was set down in writing.28 It is whenone looks closely at these societies that the reason for the primordial debttheorists’ avoidance of them becomes evident, for what one encounters “is inmany ways the exact opposite of what such theorists would have predicted,”29namely, that when Sumerian monarchs did choose to intervene in the lives oftheir subjects, they did so not through the imposition of public debts, but inthe cancellation of private ones.30In order to understand why this practice arose and what it specificallyinvolved, we must return to something I first pointed out in Babylon’sBanksters, namely, that the earliest form of circulating money in Sumeria andlater Babylonia consisted simply of clay tablets recording credit agreements.These clay tablets were … inscribed with some obligation of future payment, that werethen sealed inside clay envelopes and marked with the borrower’s seal. Thecreditor would keep the envelope as a surety, and it would be broken open onrepayment. In some times or places at least, these bullae appear to have becomewhat we would now call negotiable instruments, since the tablet inside did notsimply record a promise to pay the original lender, but was designated “to thebearer”—in other words, a tablet recording a debt of five shekels or silver (atprevailing rates of interest) could circulate as the equivalent of a five-shekelpromissory note—that is, as money.31Sumeria, in other words, was circulating not only clay tablets as debt-freestate-issued money on the surpluses of the state warehouse, but in addition tothis, circulated private credit instruments—monetized debt—as money.This circumstance gave rise to the uniquely Sumerian and Babylonian institutionof the Jubilee—the public remission and cancellation of all private debts—by thesovereign. The circumstances leading to this are rather easy to envision. Thesecurity against such debts could be literally anything: livestock, grain,bullion, or even, in many cases, the collateralization of children or otherfamily members’ labor to the creditor.32 While theoretically any of these thingscould be redeemed upon repayment, in practice this was often difficult, for themore a debtor’s assets were collateralized and taken from him, the moredifficult repayment of debts became, as cattle or family members were taken torepay interest and principle.33 Multiply this procedure throughout society atlarge, and a problem inevitably surfaced, as families—to avoid having to paysuch debts when circumstances beyond their control occurred (bad weather leadingto bad harvests, for example)—would simply flee their fields and lands, leavingsociety bereft of production.34As a result of this, and confronted “with the potential for complete socialbreakdown, Sumerian and later Babylonian kings periodically announced generalamnesties … Such decrees would typically declare all outstanding consumer debtnull and void (commercial debts were not affected), return all land to itsoriginal owners, and allow debt-peons to return to their families.”35 This soonbecame a regular institutionalized practice with Sumerian and Babylonian rulerspracticing the “ritual of the breaking of the tablets,” literally, breaking theclay records of recorded debts.36 This ritual was often performed in thespringtime, where the restoration of order and harmony in human society wasunderstood to mirror the restoration of life in the wider cosmos.But then, ca. 600–500 B.C., from the Ganges Valley to China, across Persia, intoMesopotamia, and beyond into Greece, everything began to change with thesuspiciously simultaneous and “coincidental” rise of coinage.373. Bullion, Coins, Militaries, and the “Military-Coinage-Slavery Complex”[Contents.html#rsec52]Thus far in our brief survey we have encountered two basic solutions to theproblem incurred when the Metaphor is misinterpreted to be a Metaphor ofPrimordial Debt, those two solutions being perpetual debt—with the inevitableneed for constant expansion as we shall see momentarily—or a debt jubilee, apractice that arose in ancient Sumeria and Babylonia.38This consideration brings us to that crucial period, ca. 600–500 B.C., that theGerman philosopher Karl Jaspers called the Axial Age. Jaspers so designated itbecause it was the era of the great “axiomatic” philosophers and philosophies,the Buddha, Confucius, and, of course, the beginnings of rational philosophicaldebate in ancient Greece, symbolized by the great secret society founderPythagoras.39 Not coincidentally, as we shall now see, this was also the era inwhich coinage arose. This was also, not coincidentally, the period when vastempires—and the wars that invariably accompanied them—arose. As Graeber notes,the reason for the conjunction of the two is very easy to understand, for inwars bullion and coins can be paid to anyone anywhere, and of course, can bestolen as war booty. By contrast, the sorts of virtual credit instruments inancient Sumeria and Babylonia, with their clay tablets of negotiable creditinstruments, or, for that matter, the paper money of China, were essentiallyinstruments that were only good within the societies using them and nowhereelse. These types of negotiable credit instruments, were “by definition, arecord, as well as a relation of trust,”40 and thus were of little utility inraising, provisioning, and paying the large armies of the great ancient empires.This led, inevitably, as I noted in Babylon’s Banksters, to a vicious circle. Onthe one hand, it created a class of international traders in bullion (and ofcourse, coins), and to slaves to mine the bullion for the coins. This created inturn, on the other hand, vast military machines to conquer territory and slavesto mine the bullion to pay the armies!41 Bullion, in the form of coins, thusmoved out of the hands of the temple elites during the Axial Age, and into thehands of the masses.42 This vicious cycle created what Graeber calls the“military-coinage-slavery complex”43 where the brutal circularity of the systemwas quickly evident, since money, in the form of bullion and coins, “was neededto pay armies to capture slaves to mine gold to produce money.”44 And this, ofcourse, led to the rise of an international class of people engaged in theproduction of coins, the mining of bullion, and its adjutant, slavery.However, there is a hidden working of the Metaphor in all this development, butin order to see what it is and how it occurred, we must turn to the other greatnon-economic and numismatic examination of the rise of coinage, that of RichardSeaford.B. MIND, METAPHYSICS, AND MONEY IN ANCIENT GREECE [Contents.html#rsec53]Along with Graeber’s Debt: The First 5,000 Years, Richard Seaford’s Money andthe Early Greek Mind is a magisterial examination of the relationship betweenthe rise of coinage in ancient Greece on the one hand, and the rise of rationalphilosophical cosmological speculation on the other. Coinage, as Seaford notes,does not come from Egypt or Babylonia,45 for as we have already seen, theprinciple form of money in Babylonia was negotiable credit instruments inscribedon clay tablets. Thus we are confronted by the odd fact that money, in the formof coinage, coincides with the rise of philosophical cosmology in ancientGreece,46 a fact that Seaford argues is not coincidental. Here again, we willonly be able to briefly summarize Seaford’s complex and detailed book, but indoing so I will propose a different relationship between the rise of coinage andthat of cosmological philosophical speculation than Seaford. However, in orderto make that alternative interpretation clear, we shall first have to understandwhat he has argued.Seaford begins his study by observing the metaphysical quality of money, that itis “both a thing and a relation.”47 In the latter capacity, it is a command overthe labor “of others in general,”48 or even, one might say, over “Otherness”itself. As such, it is a token or symbol (especially in the modern age ofelectronic money). But a symbol or token of what?It is when one considers this question that the metaphysical properties of moneycome to the fore, and with them, its direct relationship to the TopologicalMetaphor of the Physical Medium. The fact that money transcends all the goodsand services for which it can be exchanged, or in the purchase of which it canmanifest itself as those goods and services, renders it analogous to thatinitial No-thing that distinguishes the first step of the Metaphor. And likethat initial No-thing, it possesses (to borrow Seaford’s apt phrase),“promiscuous exchangeability.”49 Like the initial No-thing of the Metaphor, itpossesses a kind of alchemical transmutability or convertibility.50It was largely the Greeks, following the example of the Lydians, who firstintroduced the widespread use of coinage in the ancient classical world of theWest. As we noted in Babylon’s Banksters, the association of bullion, coinage,and the religious temples was often close and complex, and this is no less trueof Greece, where temples often also functioned as temples of money-changing, andcoins were often issued by temples bearing images of various deities51—furthersuggesting that the relationship of money to the cosmological Metaphor was verymuch present in the Greek mind.1. Coins, and the Metaphor [Contents.html#rsec54]a. The Stamp [Contents.html#rsec55]However, when we turn our attention to what coinage actually is in the ancientworld, and particularly in Greece, the relationship between money and theMetaphor becomes much more explicit. We begin by recalling a fact we firstmentioned in Babylon’s Banksters, and one which is especially true of ancientGreece, namely, that the intrinsic bullion value of coins was often less thanthe value officially declared and stamped on the coins themselves. The stamp, soto speak, actually created or added value to the instantiation of bullion in thecoin itself,52 such that the stamp itself became the measure of value, ratherthan the process of weighing the bullion.53 This in turn led to the closeassociation of states and temples with the minting of money, and as they came toexercise a kind of “money minting monopoly,”54 a money-making elite inevitablyarose.But of course, at the same time that all this was happening, philosophicalcosmological speculation also arose, leading Xenophanes, for example, tospeculate that behind all the diversity of the world, there was an underlying,impersonal “stuff” or substance from which that world derived, and therefore,all the gods of the Greek mythology were but man-created projections ofhumanity.55 One was left, during this period of the simultaneous appearance ofpre-Socratic philosophy and coinage, with a kind of idealized monism versus anempirical multiplicity.56 Coinage gave order and rationality to thismultiplicity, and especially to the limitless variety of interpersonal humanrelationships uniting behind the state or sovereign, who brought order to thecosmos and to those relationships.57 To put it differently, the rise of money ingeneral, and coinage in particular, was to a certain extent inevitable, since itwas implied in the physical implications of the metaphor. The problem was, whichtype of money was it? Money based on the productivity of the state (interpretingthe “fecund” version of the Metaphor as an open information-creating system), ormoney based on a closed system of a finite amount of metal, a zero sum game ofdebt (interpreting the “closed” or debt version of the Metaphor).Note what is occurring here, for it will become quite a crucial point in ourdeeper analysis of the relationship between money, the Metaphor, and the elitesbehind both, in a moment. For the present, we observe that the creation ofmoney, and philosophical cosmological speculation itself, were both being doneby elites, and that this introduced a bifurcation into Greek society, in whichthe common masses continued to practice and to believe in the deities of Greekmythology, while the elites began to believe in the impersonal version of theMetaphor.58 Seaford notes that At the apex of the long-term transactional order theanthropomorphic deities are replaced—at least in the minds of an elite—not somuch by the polis as by the metaphysical projection of the impersonal, unitary,abstract, transcendent, seemingly self-sufficient power of money, a process thatis first observable in Anaximander in early sixth-century Miletus (probably thevery first thoroughly monetized society in history) and that culminates in themetaphysics of Parmenides and Plato.59In other words, the elite was not so much irreligious as it was an elite thathad adopted a different religion than the masses, the “religion behind thereligion,” the philosophy of the Metaphor.It is important to pause here and observe what Seaford is really arguing, for heis maintaining essentially that the whole tradition of philosophical cosmology,from the Pre-Socratics up through Plato and Parmenides and right on through tothe Neoplatonists, is the result of the rise of coinage; money—in the form ofcoins—led to philosophy and to the construction of the Metaphor, not vice versa.But this, as we have seen, cannot be true either, because, simply put, theMetaphor certainly existed prior to the appearance of coinage. So what was itabout coins in particular that influenced a new burst of philosophicalexploration of the Metaphor? We may summarize these influences as follows: 1) The bullion of coinage60 represented that immortal, changeless,underlying unitary substance of the cosmos, since, for all practical intents andpurposes, bullion was immortal, and a unitary substance (such as gold, silver,and so on);61 2) As such, the bullion of coinage symbolizes the underlying physicalmedium, the No-thing of the Metaphor, in its homogeneity and ability to beexchanged—i.e., metaphorically transmuted—into anything else, i.e., goods andservices;62 3) This homogeneity of coinage also reduces the users of coinage to ahomogeneous status, since it makes all parties to the transaction equal, andmakes them manifestations of the underlying No-thing that coinage represents aswell;63 4) The division of the bullion of coinage represents the process ofdifferentiations in the Metaphor, as bullion is segregated into individualcoins, and then stamped with a value that exceeds the intrinsic value of thebullion itself. This is a vitally important point, for note how accurately theMetaphor is being reproduced here: the stamp of value adds information andindeed constitutes the information contained in the coin—its “value”—just as theprocess of differentiation in the Metaphor distinguishes “types of No-thing” bythe information content within each type of “distinguished No-thing.”Additionally, money has value more or less independent of time and space, atleast in the thinking of the early Greeks.64 In this respect, as we shall seesubsequently in this chapter, money is—in physics terms—a non-local phenomenon,for coinage represents that “common surface” that occurs during exchange, and assuch, that common surface is a non-local phenomenon. It is this distinction between the information contained inthe coin, versus the substance of the coin (its bullion), that gives rise,according to Seaford, to the metaphysical categories such as substance andaccident, or substance and individual form.65 Additionally, the initial No-thingof the Metaphor is viewed, in the Hesiodic cosmogony, as an undifferentiatedchaos. Information adds differentiation, just as with the Metaphor itself;66 5) Notably, in Greek thinking of this period, there is no notion of debtor limit to this system, for just as the No-thing of the Metaphor coulddifferentiate without limit, there was similarly no limit to money.67 TheGreeks, in other words, in spite of the rise of debt and early bankingpractices, understood the Metaphor to be an open system, rather than a closedone; 6) In the imposition of information—i.e., value—on the stamp on coins,measure and reason, or ratio [images/f0138-01.jpg][images/f0138-01.jpg], areimposed on the world of plurality and “Otherness”;68 7) Thus, individuality or personhood come to reside—at least for thebasic implications of Greek thinking—in the differentiations themselves ratherthan in the first No-thing, and individual coins with their stamp of value are ametaphor of this implication. Money itself, and the underlying substance whichit represents, are understood to be impersonal.69 In this, as we have seen, theGreeks are opting for the “impersonal/atheistic” interpretation of the Metaphor.Yet, one might also say that since man is the “common surface” or microcosm—aswe discovered in chapter two [Chapter002.html]—that money comes to representman, and to that extent, is also a microcosm, a “common surface” binding andtransacting human exchange. Hence it could be argued that the Medium, prior toits first tripartite differentiation, and in that threefold differentiation, isa kind of “super-Self” or “super-Person”; 8) We thus arrive at the most succinct statement of Seaford’s thesis:“The presocratic (sic) cosmos is, in its various forms, a projection of humaninstitutions (especially money) onto the cosmos no less than is the Olympus ofordinary believers.”70 Seaford is arguing, then, that money or coinage, in otherwords, created philosophy, created the Metaphor, and not vice versa.With these thoughts in mind, we are now in a position to begin making somepreliminary observations. Seaford has noted that the rise of coinage wascoincident with the rise of philosophical reflection on the Metaphor. In hisopinion, the rise of coinage to a certain extent originated that reflection, ifnot indeed the Metaphor itself. In this, he argues, we see both the rise of afinancial elite, and the rise of an intellectual or philosophical elite, whosetrue “atheistic” views (not believing in the gods, not as not believing in thedivinity of that primordial substance) are hidden from the masses. As we alsosaw in our review of Graeber’s work in the previous section of this chapter, theMetaphor was twisted in some early—and very modern—thinking, into the PrimordialDebt Theory. But if one assumes the opposite ordering of the relationshipbetween the Metaphor and money than does Seaford, i.e., if one assumes that theMetaphor gave rise to money, and not vice versa, then an interesting pictureemerges, namely, that of debt theory as a “meme” of social dominance promoted bythe elites who were created by the rise of coinage.It is important to understand the both/and nature of the Metaphor in thisrespect, and how it would inform the motivation of such elites in promoting thatmeme, for the Metaphor itself would, as noted previously, constitute a new kindof “religion” in polytheistic societies like ancient Greece. By believing in theunderlying unchangeable substance, such philosophical elites privately hold avery different doctrine than that publicly promoted in the temples. In thisinterpretation, their motivation in promoting the meme would be theistic.However, in the view of that underlying substance as impersonal, their view inpromoting the meme of primordial debt would be atheistic, but in either case,the result is the same: a meme would be created that would enhance the power ofthat philosophical-financial elite.b. The Idealized Substance and the Coincidence of Opposites[Contents.html#rsec56]We have just suggested that rather than coinage giving rise to the Metaphor—asSeaford implies—that the reverse is true, the Metaphor gave rise to coinage. Inthe broadest historical point of view, this is true, for the Vedic texts thatcontain the Metaphor are, as we have seen, much older than coinage. But beforewe can make the argument about the Metaphor giving rise to coinage tighter, wemust explore other details of the relationship between the two.We may begin by noting an observation that Seaford makes concerning therelationship of this underlying substance to the primordial elements—earth, air,fire, and water—and to money: Just as the circulation of goods (money-goods-money, etc.) isdriven by (unsubstantial yet all-underlying) money according to a numericalabstraction (logos) that may seem embodied in the money, so cosmic circulation(fire-things-fire etc.) is driven by (insubstantial yet all-underlying) fireaccording to the logos, which appears to be embodied in the fire. Both money …and fire have the transcendent power to transform things into their opposite.71This returns us to a property of that underlying No-thing of the Metaphor thatwe noted in chapter two [Chapter002.html] in connection with Giordano Bruno: thecoincidence of opposites in that medium.Money thus combines a uniquely impersonal characteristic with a uniquelysuper-personal one, in an almost identical fashion to the way the initialNo-thing of the Metaphor can be viewed both as supremely impersonal, random, andchaotic, and supremely personal and ordered.72 In this, once again, it is afaithful reflection of the both/and nature of the dialectic of the Metaphor, andof its conjunction of opposites.2. The Hidden Elite’s Hand: Pythagoreanism [Contents.html#rsec57]As we have noted, the essence of Seaford’s argument is that money, in the formof coinage, created the philosophical and cosmological speculations of rationalGreek philosophy during the pre-Socratic period. We have also discovered thereare weighty and cogent reasons to support such a view. It is, however, when weturn to a consideration of the possibility of hidden elites driving the spreadof coinage that this view begins to unravel, and indeed, it is Seaford himselfwho notices it: “In the advanced city-states coined money was used generally,but belief in the impersonal cosmos of the presocratics was almost certainlyconfined to an elite.”73 One such elite, as Seaford observes, are thePythagoreans, who, moreover, appear to have had an influential role in thespread of coinage in cities where their secret society was present: … the Pythagoreans of Croton controlled numerous other Greekcities of Southern Italy. This is supported by the evidence of contemporarycoinage. The earliest coinage of Southern Italy had... spread very quickly, withseveral cities sharing a remarkable uniformity both of technique and of weightstandard.74The Pythagoreans, as Seaford observes, were especially renowned for threedifferent types of activity: they were, first of all, a secret society dedicatedto a particular way of life. Additionally, they were a political society in thatthey sought, and exercised, political power. Finally, they were, as most know, asociety dedicated to a philosophy that was orally transmitted, a philosophywhose core doctrine was that “number is all.”75 This doctrine of “number is all”once again dovetails quite neatly into the appearance of coinage, with its stampof value on a metal. Pythagoreanism, in other words, is the key group reflectingthe “mathematicization” of human society and transaction represented bycoinage.76However, as I have stated elsewhere, there is significant evidence to suggestthat the Pythagoreans have a connection to Mesopotamia and to Babylonia, both intheir mathematical speculations and in the cosmological implications theydeduced from them.77 The idea of cosmology and the connection to number, inother words, predated the rise of coinage, and the Pythagoreans were definitelyconnected to both, making it thus possible to view their role influencing thespread of coinage as deliberate. When we couple this implication to what wasstated in Part One of this book—that Hermeticism itself appears to have ancientEgyptian roots—then the possibility becomes much more likely that these hiddenelites are driving the appearing of coinage very deliberately, as a social andmonetary reflection of the Metaphor.There is one final point to be adduced in this regard. In my book Genes, Giants,Monsters, and Men, I outlined how ancient megalithic sites appeared to have beenconstructed—millennia before the rise of ancient classical civilizations andtherefore millennia prior to the appearance of any kind of money, clay tablets,coinage, or otherwise—around uniform standards of measure that wereastronomically and geodetically based, and that their appearance was possiblydue to the influence of hidden elites,78 a thesis I explored further in The Gridof the Gods with co-author Scott D. de Hart.79 As I noted in Genes, Giants,Monsters, and Men, such a uniform standard of weights and measures could only beuniform if they were based on astronomical and geodetic observation; moreover,uniformity of such weights and measures is a prerequisite for commerce on alarge scale.It would appear then that the Metaphor is driving the elites, and that they inturn are driving not only vast construction projects, but the appearance ofmoney, in any form.C. THE TALLY: MONEY AS THE COMMON SURFACE OF THE METAPHOR [Contents.html#rsec58]Before taking leave of this retrospective, it is worth pausing to consider onefinal detail. We have noted that coinage, in its use of metals with a stamp ofabstract value, embodies in an almost perfect analogy the ancient TopologicalMetaphor of the Physical Medium, both with respect to the “eternity” of thesubstance of the bullion in coins themselves, and in the abstract “commonsurface” of a non-local character that they represent as a stable form ofexchange and transmutability across specific times and places. It is worthobserving, then, that there is yet another form of money that emerged in ancienttimes, and continued even throughout the Middle Ages, and that is the notion ofthe “tally,” a physical object such as a stick—or broken clay tablet—whose twohalves symbolized a transaction between two parties. Here, Graeber comments veryaptly: “A tally does away with the need for witnesses; if the two surfaces agreethen everyone knows that the agreement between the contracting parties exists aswell.”80However, as a closer examination of this notion reveals, the two parts of thetally are conjoined, not upon two surfaces, but upon one abstract common surfacewhich joins the two parts, no matter how far apart the two parts are from eachother. In this, too, the common surface becomes a non-local phenomenon. Theapparently crude mechanism of the tally is thus in fact a very sophisticatedembodiment of the whole notion of money and the Metaphor’s common surface as anon-local phenomenon.Philosophical speculation therefore did not appear as the result of coinage, butas is more likely, the reverse: coinage appeared as the result of the Metaphor,as hidden elites contemplated its implications for the ordering of society andcommerce. However, as this chapter has also suggested, the appearance of coinagedid raise the issue of impersonal substance and transaction versus the notion ofthe persons conducting them.In order to contemplate that relationship more fully, we must now return to theMiddle Ages, to the rise of modern banking and that most important conceptionsquatting in the middle of it all, the rise of the doctrine of corporatepersonhood.________________________1 David Greaber, Debt: The First 5,000 Years (Brooklyn: Melville House,2011), p. 69.2 Graeber, Debt, p. 43, citing the Satapatha Brahmana, 1.7.12. 1–6.3 Ibid., citing the Rid Veda, 8.47.17.4 Ibid., p. 56.5 Farrell and de Hart, The Grid of the Gods, pp. 201–203.6 Graeber, Debt, p. 57.7 Ibid.8 Bruno Théret, “The Socio-Cultural Dimensions of the Currency:Implications for the Transition to the Euro,” Journal of Consumer Policy,22:51-79, cited in Graeber, Debt, p. 58, emphasis added.9 Graeber, Debt, p. 58.10 Ibid., p. 59.11 Ibid., p. 63.12 Ibid.13 George Spencer-Brown, Laws of Form: The New Edition of This Classic withthe First-Ever Proof of Riemann’s Hypothesis (Leipzig: Bohmeier Verlag, 1999),p. 3.14 I presented a very different way of analyzing or “imagining” thisprimordial cleaving in the appendix to chapter nine in my Giza Death StarDestroyed.15 Graeber, Debt, pp. 62–63. Graeber implies that the ploy is transparent,since what is being implicitly argued is a ploy, namely, to transfer fromreligion to central banks the idea of the payment of infinite debt, which is, aswe have seen, a massive misreading of the Metaphor. Graeber notes that there islittle to distinguish the older religious reading of this primordial debt andthe modern nationalist one: “One might even say that what we really have, in theidea of primordial debt, is the ultimate nationalist myth. Once we owed ourlives to the gods that created us, paid interest in the form of animalsacrifice, and ultimately paid back the principal with our lives. Now we owe itto the Nation that formed us, pay interest in the form of taxes, and when itcomes time to defend the nation against its enemies, to offer to pay it with ourlives.” (Debt, p. 71.)16 Ibid., p. 68.17 Ibid., p. 245.18 Ibid.19 See my The Philosophers’ Stone, pp. 25–81, 260–267.20 Graeber, Debt, pp. 256–257.21 Ibid., pp. 262–265.22 Ibid., p. 266.23 Ibid., p. 270.24 Ibid.25 Ibid.26 Ibid., see p. 235ff.27 Ibid., p. 165.28 Ibid., p. 64.29 Ibid.30 Ibid.31 Ibid, pp. 214–215.32 Ibid., p. 65.33 Ibid.34 Ibid., see the discussion on p. 183 in connection with this point.35 Ibid., p. 65.36 Ibid., p. 217.

Seaford also states this principle on p. 257 in nouncertain terms: “The oneness of monetary value must, through all its exchangeswith a vast variety of goods, retain its identity. It is important for thefunctioning of money that monetary value be exactly the same not only indifferent places but also at different times. It is this unprecedentedall-pervasive functional unchanging oneness, uniting in the minds of its usersone place with another and present with future, that enters unconsciously intoParmenidies’ conception of the One.” (Emphasis in the original.)65 Ibid., p. 136: “The invention and use of the earliest coins demanded therecognition of the combination of, and antithesis between, sign (or form) andsubstance, an antithesis in which, although the substance must have someintrinsic value, decisive is the sign, which implies a homogeneous idealsubstance distinct from the metal in which the sign is expressed.” Note veryclearly what Seaford has stated here: the bullion of the coin is itself asymbol, which, along with its stamp of value, represents or symbolizes thephysical medium and its differentiations via the information content of thosedifferentiations.

See Seaford, Money and the Early Greek Mind, pp. 280–281.This means, to put it as nakedly as possible, that money is a component of theircosmological doctrine, not vice versa.78 Genes, Giants, Monsters, and Men: The Surviving Elites of the Cosmic Warand Their Hidden Agenda (Port Townsend, WA: Feral House, 2011), pp. 31–65.79 Farrell and de Hart, The Grid of the Gods, pp. 63–126.80 Graeber, Debt, p. 302."},{"pageContent":"[images/chap.jpg][images/chap.jpg] Seven [Contents.html#rch7][images/chap1.jpg][images/chap1.jpg]LAW, LANGUAGE, AND LIABILITY: The Persona Ficta of the Corporate Person inTheology and Finance [Contents.html#rch7][images/bull3a.jpg]“Quite often, in fact, we find bankers accused of buying counterfeit coins aswell as stolen valuables such as gems and silver belts. As we have seen …sometimes they themselves were discovered to be partners in the production anddistribution of counterfeit coins, or they were found to have ordered thewholesale clipping and filing of mint coins, even though culling was a criminalactivity.”—Reinhold C. Mueller1THERE IS A JOKE GOING AROUND in the wake of the vast fraud committed by thebanking and securities communities over the past few years: “I’ll believe thatcorporations are persons,” says our anonymous interlocutor, “when the state ofTexas executes one of them.” In some versions of the joke, the names of thecorporations—J.P. Morgan-Chase, Goldman Sachs, and a host of others—top the listof those on “corporate death row.” Of course, in the audience there is always alawyer or two who objects that the whole purpose of corporations is to limitpersonal liability for the misdeeds of a corporation or its officers.But it was not always so, and indeed, the original basis of the doctrine of thecorporate person is theological, and the whole point of the theological versionof the doctrine was precisely to make sure that an individual could be morallyculpable for someone else’s misdeeds. So how did we get from the theologicaldoctrine to the current state of affairs? How did we start with a doctrine whosewhole purpose was to hold humanity corporately responsible and morally culpablefor an individual’s misdeed, and arrive at the present, when the corporateperson can, and has, gotten away with fraud on a massive scale, while manycorporate officers presiding over the fiasco have actually given themselvesbonuses for their “performance”?A. THE THEOLOGICAL PART OF THE STORY [Contents.html#rsec59]The theological part of this story begins with a mistranslation made by St.Jerome in the Latin Vulgate, and with how St. Augustine of Hippo Regius, on thebasis of that mistranslation, formulated the Western Church’s doctrine of“Original Sin.”But first, some caveats.The first caveat is this: to attempt to survey the vast amount of literaturethat has been written about the doctrine of corporate personhood as an adjunctof the Western Church’s doctrine of original sin in a few mere pages in achapter is an impossibility. Whole tomes have been written about the subject,and all that can be accomplished here is to show the basic theological concepts,their roots, interconnections, and a few of the sweeping implications of thatdoctrine for the formation of Western culture, jurisprudence, and finance.The second caveat flows from those previously mentioned roots, interconnections,and implications, for the doctrine as the Western Church came to hold it—in oneform or another, and in varying degrees of “severity”—was precisely a westerndoctrine, unique to the medieval Latin Church, and therefore in its conceptualroots unique to the Protestant churches that broke from it. It was not, and isnot, the doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox churches, which do not even refer tothe doctrine as “original sin” but as “the ancestral sin.” As we shall discoverin this short excursus, the western doctrine is intimately related to the notionof the “infinite debt” that mankind supposedly owes God, and to the WesternChurch’s interpretation of the sacrifice of Christ as a kind of “infinitesacrifice” balancing the divine account books.1. The Central Verse and Crux Interpretum [Contents.html#rsec60]a. The Greek and the King James [Contents.html#rsec61]The easiest way to approach this complex subject in our theologically illiterateculture is by examining just one verse in the New Testament, a verse that is, soto speak, the foundation for the doctrine of original sin. That verse is Romans5:12. In our exposition of this verse, it is important for the reader toremember that we are compacting centuries of analysis and theologicalinterpretation, and thus, the reader will have to learn a bit of theology, and alittle Greek and Latin, along the way. We cite the verse here in the translationof the Authorized (King James) Version, for reasons that will become apparentshortly: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death bysin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.Before we proceed with complex analysis, it should be noted that the verse doesnot say that “sin nature” or even “guilt” passed upon all men, but that deathdid.Now let us begin to look at this verse, and particularly the last clause of theverse—“for that all have sinned”—very closely. In the original Greek, this reads[images/f0147-01.jpg][images/f0147-01.jpg] and the two words that concern ushere are [images/f0147-02.jpg][images/f0147-02.jpg] (or “eph ho,” totransliterate it), which the King James translators have very carefully (as weshall see) translated “for that.” The interesting thing about thisexpression—[images/f0147-03.jpg][images/f0147-03.jpg]—is that it is capable ofthree different interpretations all at the same time (after all, this isGreek!). These two little Greek words are, in the first instance, an idiomaticexpression, meaning simply “because.” Thus, the first meaning of the verse inthe Greek is this: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death bysin; and so death passed upon all men, because all have sinned.However, it is when we consider the meaning of the two Greek words[images/f0147-04.jpg][images/f0147-04.jpg] ω—eph ho—separately that the meaningbecomes more specific. The second of these words, ω, or ho, is a masculinesingular reflexive pronoun, referring, obviously, to a masculine singularantecedent in the previous parts of the sentence. The first word, εφ, or eph, isa preposition, which in this grammatical construction means “for that reason” or“because of which.” Notably, by adopting the translation “for that,” the KingJames translators were being scrupulously faithful in trying to preserve notonly the first meaning—“because”—but also the other two possiblemeanings—“because of which” or “for that reason”.So the question at this point becomes “what is the antecedent of the masculinesingular pronoun ω, or ho?”In the previous parts of the verse, there are only two possibilities in theGreek, the “one man” [images/f0147-05.jpg][images/f0147-05.jpg] and death[images/f0147-06.jpg][images/f0147-06.jpg].If one takes the first antecedent, the “one man,” then the meaning of the versebecomes this: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death bysin; and so death passed upon all men, because of the one man all have sinned.But there is a problem with this reading, and many Greek church fathers saw itimmediately. The problem is that in such constructions, the normal rules ofgrammatical exegesis infer that reflexive pronouns refer, not to the farthestantecedent, but to the nearest, which in this case, is not the “one man,” butdeath. Thus, the more specific reading of the verse is this: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death bysin; and so death passed upon all men, because of death all have sinned.What this means is that on the first reading of the verse—“so death passed uponall men, because all have sinned”—is that death is a punishment for individualpersonal sin, whereas on the third reading of the verse—“so death passed uponall men, (and) because of death, all have sinned”—it is death, i.e., physicaland spiritual corruption, that is passed from Adam and Eve to their descendants,but not the moral culpability for their sin. In other words, it is theconsequence of their action—death—that is passed on, but not the moralresponsibility for someone else’s misdeed. Indeed, it is largely the first andthe third reading that the Greek church fathers favored, and hence, there is nonotion within Eastern Orthodoxy that one inherits a moral culpability for Adamand Eve, or a “sin nature” as is often stated in the western version of thedoctrine.This close reading of the verse had enormous consequences for how the EasternChurch interprets other texts relating to this issue, and also had enormousconsequences for legal and cultural developments in the East, not the least ofwhich was that within Orthodox cultures it is not the Crucifixion of Christ thatis the central liturgical event, but the Resurrection of Christ that is thecentral liturgical and cultural event. The reason is simple: the basic problemof mankind, on this view, is not so much a moral one (and hence, not a problemof infinite debt), but, so to speak, a physical one that only God Incarnate,through the conquest of death, can repair.2Note something very important here, for it will be crucial to understanding howthe Western doctrine is in fact a doctrine of inherited guilt or moralculpability based on the doctrine of corporate personhood. In the Greek, deathis indeed a natural consequence, that is to say, it inheres in the common humannature passed on from parent to child, and thus, in the Orthodox Christian view,from Adam and Eve to the rest of humanity. But in the Orthodox view sin remainsa personal choice, and hence, the moral culpability is only ascribed to theindividual person committing the act. Thus, a very clear distinction is drawnbetween person and nature, a distinction that, as we shall now see, dissolves inthe Western version of the doctrine.3b. The Latin Vulgate and All Other English Translations [Contents.html#rsec62]It is when we turn to the Latin Vulgate translation of St. Jerome that we seethe origins of the western doctrine that will become codified by St. Augustineof Hippo Regius, for here, there is clearly an implied doctrine of a “corporateperson.” In the Vulgate, Romans 5:12 reads this way: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death bysin; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.The Latin of the last phrase is quite clear, emphatic, and insistent: en quoomnes peccaverunt, opting to translate only the second possible meaning of theGreek [images/f0149-01.jpg][images/f0149-01.jpg], a reading that, as we saw, wasnot favored by the Greek fathers nor really even consonant with normal rules ofgrammar.Now we must “parse” this reading somewhat, again compacting massive amounts oftheological writings of the period, and massive amounts of analysis. Our guidehere will be the two crucial categories of person and nature, and the thirdmetaphysical category so essential to theological dogmatics, the category ofnatural operation. We may get a glimmer of what each of these categories aredesigned to do, by noting the questions they are designed to answer: 1) Person answers the question who is doing something? 2) Natural operation answers the question what is it that they are doing?and 3) Nature answers the question what are they that they are doing thesethings?We can gain an appreciation of the second and third questions from the old adage“if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, all naturaloperations of ducks, it’s a duck, i.e., possesses the common nature of duckdom.”We get close to an understanding of the difference between person and naturehere by noting that ordinary language maintains it. We say “I am a person(person)” but “I have a soul” (nature), and thus, the rational faculties ofhuman nature and soul are distinct from the person itself. As we shall see, itis customary for those in the West’s culture to make the mistake of identifyingperson with soul and thus to reduce person to the soul’s rational and volitionalfaculties, for reasons we shall get to shortly, reasons closely allied to thedoctrine of an inherited moral culpability, the corporate person, and thepeculiarly and uniquely western doctrine of “original sin” as distinct from theEastern doctrine of ancestral sin.It is these three categories of metaphysical distinctions—person, naturaloperations, and nature—and the three questions associated with them that formthe basis of trinitarian theology, the doctrine of the Incarnation, andtheological anthropology. It is worth pausing to take a short look at the firsttwo, before passing on to a consideration of what happens to these threecategories when viewed in the context of the implied doctrine of inherited guiltand the theological anthropology of the Western reading of Romans 5:12. It isimportant to note that our sole purpose here is not to defend the truthfulnessor falsity of these doctrines, but merely to elucidate the general method ofthinking behind them.With respect to the database or dataset of the first two fields—trinitariantheology and the Incarnation—the texts of the canonical New Testament became, ofcourse, the basis on which the questions were posed. For example, if in the NewTestament the fathers saw Christ uttering phrases with the words “I am”—the nameof God in the Old Testament—and performing miracles or forgiving sins, and ifthe Holy Spirit could be blasphemed against, then the clear implication was thatthe “Whos” that were “doing these things” had the same common “divine” nature.Hence, three persons doing common operations of a common underlying nature.With respect to Christ, the same order of asking questions in terms of thecategories led to a different result. There, one person was performing twoentirely different sets of natural operations: “divine” ones like healing thesick, forgiving sins, and so on, and human ones like walking, talking, and soon. This led to the famous Chalcedonian definition in 451 that he was one Personin two natures. In both the trinitarian and christological instances, it isimportant to note that the distinction of the three categories has beenmaintained.Now let us return to the Western version of Romans 5:12 and parse what is goingon in terms of the categories of person, natural operation, and nature, to seewhat has happened. First, let us recall the reading of the Vulgate itself: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death bysin; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.Note now the implied steps of the metaphysical “logic” here: 1) The person of Adam—the “one man” of the verse—sins; 2) Sin is a personal use of the natural operation or exercise of thehuman will, which is a property common to human nature; 3) But the moral culpability of that choice passes to all his descendants(in whom all have sinned); thus, 4) The natural operation of the will and its personal use now defines thecontent of all persons common to the inherited nature. In other words, personhas been confused with nature on the basis of one, or several, persons usingtheir common faculty of will in the same or similar ways. This common functionaluse thus implicitly defines the very person itself, and consequently makespossible the conception of a “group” or “corporate” person conceived preciselyin terms of this common functional use of the will. It is this step, in otherwords, which informs the corporate logic so many people find frustrating,namely, the formation of corporate “group think” cultures. Such a phenomenon isbuilt into, and an inherent component of, the underlying corporate logic of thedoctrine of original guilt.In other words, the distinction between person, operation, and nature has beencompletely blurred,4 and what has arisen as a consequence is a kind of “groupperson”—the Protestant theologians would sometimes call it a federal person or“the federal Adam”—which is defined by the assumed common functions of the willand its involvement in a universal guilt. Persons engaged in common functions—inthis case, “sin”—defined the group, or corporate, person in this case, all ofhumanity descended from, or “in” Adam: “in whom all have sinned.” It is thisstep that forms the theological basis of the doctrine of corporate personhood inlaw.Finally, in its own way, this doctrine is deeply rooted to the Western Church’sunderstanding of the Atonement of Christ as being the payment of an infinitedebt.5 In one sense, the understanding of “original sin” as an inherited guiltor culpability in someone else’s moral choices, by dint of the human nature allshare in common, means that “sin,” perceived as a “debt” owed to God, beginsboth to “accumulate,” and to be a systemic problem. And since God is “infinite”and “infinitely righteous,” this means that the debt is infinite, and beyond theability of mankind to repay, hence God, who is infinite according to this logic,had to become man in the Incarnation, and slaughter himself to himself, to repaythe debt in an infinite death to abolish the “principle.” Notice that in thisversion of the doctrine, the ancient “topological metaphor” of the medium, whichbegan as a metaphor of fecundity and creativity, as an open system of virtuallylimitless creation of information, was transformed into a zero-sum game and aclosed system, for no matter how much information was created, that informationwas always in the form of debt, which only the top echelon of themetaphor—God—could pay off. We will encounter the metaphor, and itstransformation within this closed system approach, yet again in this chapter, sofor the moment, it is important to note how the closed system interpretation hasroots deep within the western theological tradition.2. The Corporation, or Partnership, in Medieval Italian Law[Contents.html#rsec63]With this all-too-short and clumsy theological analysis in mind, we return tothe main story, for we can see the role of this theological formulation nowheremore clearly than in the high medieval formulations of the liability ofcorporate partnerships, for it is here that we see clearly how the conceptionspreviously outlined entered into secular jurisprudence … and finance.In his superlative study The Medieval Super-Companies: A Study of the PeruzziCompany of Florence, Edwin S. Hunt makes the following observations, which aredirectly germane to our survey here. 1) The medieval super-companies—with which we shall be dealing in theremainder of this chapter—were organized as semi-permanent partnerships;6 2) The intended semi-permanent or permanent nature of these partnershipswas attested to by their use of a company logo, “such as the golden pears on ablue background in the case of the Peruzzi and the diamond-shaped heraldicdesign of the Bardi”;7 3) These partnerships were formed and dissolved entirely at the whim ofthe partners themselves, with such dissolutions being normally for the purposeof effecting new shareholdings of the partners themselves. Normally, upon suchdissolutions and shareholding realignments, profits (or losses) were distributedamong the partners/shareholders on a prorated basis;8We now come to the crux of the matter, and the link to the theological basis ofthe doctrine of the corporate person. Hunt writes: 4) The “money values” that reflected the stake or share that a partnerheld in the company “entitled each owner to a share of profit or loss proratedto the percentage of this contribution to total company capital. Thus, the word‘shareholder’ can be used interchangeably with the word ‘partner.’ The companieswere partnerships in the sense that each shareholder was subject to unlimitedliability against all of his personal possessions in the case of bankruptcy.”9Note that unlike the modern corporation, the medieval conception still holds thepersons who constitute the shareholders of the “group person” of the corporationas personally liable for the losses or failure of the corporation or partnershipitself. In other words, the theological doctrine is still fully effective insecular conceptions. With this, we may now turn to the financial part of thestory, and the rise and collapse of the great Florentine medievalsuper-companies, and lurking behind it all, the role of the financial oligarchsof Venice. And once again, in doing so, we will encounter in a new guise the“topological metaphor” of the medium.B. THE FINANCIAL PART OF THE STORY: THE COLLAPSE OF THE BARDI AND PERUZZI“SUPER-COMPANIES” IN THE 1340s [Contents.html#rsec64]1. General Considerations and Aspects of the “Super-Companies”[Contents.html#rsec65]It is worth noting at the outset that the rise of the great Florentine“super-companies,” the Bardi company and the Peruzzi company, in the 14thcentury was closely synchronized with the demise of the previous great bankersto western Europe, the Templar order, in 1312. Like the Templars, the Bardi andPeruzzi quickly came to fill the role as “bankers” to the kings and princes ofEurope with whose territories their enterprises had dealings. One might go sofar as to speculate that there is some sort of connection between the demise ofthe one, and the rise of the others. Such speculation will, however, have to betabled until later, when we examine once again the role of the SerenissimaRepublica of Venice in the demise of the great super-companies of Florence. Inconsidering the possible role of Venice in their demise our catalogue of“oligarchical techniques of manipulation” will be considerably expanded, as weshall see.But why the term “super-company” at all?Again, in his critical study of this period and of these companies, Edwin Huntnotes that the modern term “multi-national” company would be misleading, sincethe nation states of that era were themselves not the sprawling bureaucraticedifices we see today, nor, in many cases, were they very large. The sameproblem holds true with the term “mega-company,” which conjures images ofcorporations with vastly larger amounts of capital, personnel, and otherresources than was actually the case. Hence, the term “super-company” simplydenotes an entity dealing on an international scale, with sufficient economiesof scale to do so, but with a much narrower basis of operating capital andpersonnel than would be the case with a modern multi-national corporation.10 InHunt’s own words, “The medieval super-company is defined here as a privateprofit-seeking organization operating several lines of business in a very largevolume in multiple, widespread locations through a network of permanentbranches.”11 It is this breadth of operation, sitting on top of a small base ofcapitalization, that in part tells the story both of their rise, and theircollapse,12 but, as we shall see, only part of the reasons. The other part ofthe story must be carefully pieced together from a consideration of the academicmonographs. When this is done, the black shadow of conspiratorial competitiononce more looms over the historical landscape.There is another aspect that distinguishes these medieval “super-companies” fromthe modern multinational corporation, and that is that the medieval versionsremained much more tightly in the control of the families—for our purposes theBardi and Peruzzi, though there were a few others—that founded them. Indeed,Hunt observes that the company names are derived from the founding families,such that it becomes problematical “to distinguish between the activities andmotivations of such companies and those of the eponymous families.”13 In thecase of the Peruzzi company, though it relied upon many shareholders, control ofthe company was always firmly in the hands of the family, and the capo or “CEO”of the company was always a Peruzzi.14As a matter of course, these medieval super-companies relied upon a careful“philosophy of management,” for given the slow nature of communications of theday, this meant that strategic decisions effecting the long-term goals of thecompany remained in centralized family control, but operational decisions had tobe left in the hands of local factors, or “branch managers,” who were trained inthe central offices in Florence. In branches of extreme importance, thesefactors were often members of the founding and controlling family itself.15As a further means of retaining familiar control over the strategic functions ofthe partnership, all staffing of the branches was overseen by the centraloffices in Florence, that is to say by the founding and controlling families,16and as a further means of retaining control, personnel in the various branchoffices and locations were routinely rotated.17 All of this, of course, alsorequired that the companies maintain consistent intelligence gathering,communications, and courier systems.18In any case, with the Bardi and Peruzzi we are once again perhaps looking atthat transference of families from Rome and its environs northward that beganduring the decline and collapse of the Western Empire. As I have notedelsewhere, this may be significant, for many of these families that movednorthward to found the communities that would become the great Italiancity-states of Genoa, Florence, Milan, and of course, Venice, were brought tothe Roman Empire and to suburbican Italy from “Chaldea,” that is, fromMesopotamia, upon the Roman annexation of the region.19 In the case of thePeruzzi family, the subject of Hunt’s study, the family appears to be of ancientRoman descent, however, by the same token, its lack of mention in annual listsof Florentine noble families prior to 1280 suggests that it was not an ancientfamily.20 Here, as elsewhere, the truth probably lies in hidden family records,though as we shall see, with Venice we are in a slightly more favorableposition.Like the Templars before them, the Bardi and Peruzzi companies of Florenceestablished lucrative trading monopolies over certain commodities within variousEuropean states, most notably the England of Edward III in order to finance thebeginnings of the Hundred Years’ War, and thus effectively became “bankers” tomonarchs. It is here that our story, and our analysis, must begin, for thestandard academic interpretation of the causes of the demise of the Bardi andPeruzzi is that when Edward III defaulted on his loans, these companies, caughtin a “liquidity crisis,” themselves collapsed in the 1340s.21 But as Huntobserves, this is largely an academic myth that scholars continue to repeat, forthe exposure to Edward III by the Bardi and Peruzzi companies was not nearly aslarge as scholars originally thought, and thus the causes for their demise mustbe sought elsewhere. Hunt’s study is an attempt to do precisely that, to findthat “elsewhere”22 and the real reasons for the sudden and spectacular collapseof these companies.2. A Catalogue of Techniques: The Rise of the Peruzzi Company, and Mercantilism[Contents.html#rsec66]A glance—and it can only be a glance—at the rise of the Peruzzi company willdemonstrate just how quickly the medieval super-companies mastered all thetechniques that many would now ascribe to the conspiratorial machinations ofmodern banksters, corporations, and groups like the Bilderbergers, the Councilon Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and so on.One of the standard modern techniques—the winning of special monopolisticconcessions from the various governments in whose territories it was conductingbusiness—was practiced by the Peruzzi and other medieval super-companies, andwith a vengeance. Hunt makes a very important observation, an observation inwhich we see a familiar practice of the financial elites beginning to emerge.“The Peruzzi records,” he observes, “show that different members of the familyfollowed different career paths—military, diplomatic, political, ecclesiastical,professional, and entrepreneurial—and many generated their own sources ofwealth.”23 This penetration into the loci of public power—the church,professional occupations, military, and the organs of domestic and internationalpolitics—became the “playbook” for financial elites ever after, and, as we shalldiscover later within this chapter and have already seen, the Venetiansperfected this strategy to a very fine art.One of the key areas of such penetration was, of course, to gain influence orcontrol over the actual issuance of money itself, i.e., to gain influence orcontrol over the various national mints with which they dealt, beginning, ofcourse, with Florence itself.24 The Peruzzi company began its rise to power byexploiting the situation between southern and northern Italy in the late 1200sand early 1300s. Namely, the Kingdom of Naples was, at that time, the grainsupplier to the small city-states of northern Italy, and in return, was animporter of textiles and other manufactured goods from northern Italy and therest of Europe, a fact that required the super-companies to have highcapitalization.25 The Bardi and Peruzzi became the middlemen in this commoditiestrade, and thus, their corporations made much of their income on the commoditiesmarket. As a result of this type of trade, the super-companies, much like theirmodern counterparts, became involved in all aspects of the trade, fromproduction and manufacturing, shipping, and of course ultimately the issuanceand exchange of currency itself.26Thus, by 1316, the Peruzzi company had joined a consortium or syndicate of theother great Florentine companies—the Bardi, and Acciaiuoli, later joined in 1330by the Buonaccorsi—to operate the mints of the kingdom of Naples, collect thetaxes, and pay various bureaucrats and troops.27 In other words, the Florentinesuper-companies had essentially formed a cartel for the purposes of coordinatingand controlling their activities in the Kingdom of Naples, a move doubtlesslyinduced in part by the need to present a powerful front to the government, andto enforce repayment of loans. This is a point to which we shall returnmomentarily. But for the moment, one should also note that similarly, for ashort period of time, the Peruzzi had gained influence over the mints of Francein Paris, Troyes, Tournai, and Sommières.28How was such influence and even control gained?This may be understood through close consideration of Hunt’s research andcomments on the relationship between the Peruzzi company and the Angevin kingdomof Naples. Hunt notes that by large loans to the Neapolitan crown, whichspecified precise details on when, where, and how the payments would be loanedto the crown, and more importantly how they were to be repaid: Repayment was achieved mainly by diverting to the lenders certainrevenues of the crown designated in the loan contracts, such as general taxreceipts from a city, province, or the whole kingdom, or from gabelles andcustoms. Frequently, repayment was made through the waiver of the export tax ongrain … The companies looked to currency exchange and fees for transporting cashfor some profit but obtained most of their earnings in the form of “gifts” fromthe king … mostly they were in the form of tax exemptions, franchises, andvaluable privileges, the most coveted of which was the right to export grain.29This short quotation, summing up the practices of the Peruzzi company, is atextbook catalogue of the standard methods of private financial oligarchy toobtain influence, and eventually control, over the institutions of a sovereigngovernment via economic privilege.Before we comment further on this, however, let us look at another example ofthis pattern with the behavior of the Bardi and Peruzzi toward King Edward III’sEngland. The Peruzzi company, like the Bardi company, gained trading privilegesfrom the English monarchy in return for large loans, which were “the price ofadmission to the wool trade,”30 at that time under a royal monopoly. At thisjuncture of history, such nations were too large and powerful for any onecompany to force an exclusive monopoly over such privileges, and indeed, EdwardIII preferred to disperse such privileges to a narrow group of firms, though, aswe saw, a syndicate or cartel of sorts was created by the Florentine companiesto present a more united front to the Kingdom of Naples. Thus the pattern isrepeated: the “gifts” from monarchs or states that were of the most value to thesuper-companies were tax exemptions and privileged trading positions in thecommodities and manufactured goods that were the core of their business.31 Inthe case of the Kingdom of Naples, the large loans advanced to the Kingdom,specifically to King Charles II at the beginning of the fourteenth century,gained for the Peruzzi company various special privileges, among them theability to open a bank in Naples, control of the taxation of grain exports (!),and the right to have civil cases involving the company “put before the Court ofAppeals, not the ordinary tribunals.”32 In other words, they obtained specialjuridical privileges or, to put it somewhat differently, the creation of specialcourts or special jurisdiction to hear cases involving the Peruzzi.33 Notably,throughout all of this, there was no direct challenge to the maritime powers,Genoa and above all Venice.34 Note that what has actually happened is that thesuper-companies had: (1) negotiated that some of the kingdom’s tax revenues had to bespecifically earmarked as loan repayments, in other words, they negotiated alien on certain revenues of the kingdom, and (2) negotiated their own tax collection prerogatives in order to ensurethose obligations would be fulfilled. In short, they had negotiated away thesovereignty of the Kingdom of Naples.Or, to put all these points more succinctly, they had acquired the sovereigntyof the Kingdom of Naples by achieving control of essential state functionsthrough the extension of loans and the imposition of what modern internationalbanks call “conditionalities.”Now let us catalogue the “playbook of techniques” of the super-companies as ithas emerged thus far: 1) Retain familial control over the strategic operations of the companyby maintaining controlling interest in the shares of the company; 2) Penetrate or infiltrate the key institutions and operations of thestate—diplomatic, governmental, and above all, the mints or currency issuance—bytraining family members and close associates in those fields, with the goalbeing to make government institutions and bureaucracies fronts for corporateactivity; 3) Work within existing legal constraints—in this period, the Churchprohibition against usury—by negotiating privileged positions for the company intrading rights, tax exemptions, and even tax-collecting; 4) Control, or at least influence, the entire range of the company’sactivities, from shipping, to manufacture and production, to currency andcommodity exchange affecting those operationsIn short, what one is looking at is classical mercantilism, rather than“capitalism” per se.We would err, however, if we assumed this exhausted the playbook of techniques.a. Control Both Sides of a (Dialectical) Conflict [Contents.html#rsec67]Hunt reports that in 1312, the Peruzzi company negotiated a large loan to thegrand masters of the Knights Hospitallers order, for the then-astronomical sumof 191,000 florins.35This money, as Hunt notes, was to be employed for the construction offortifications and other buildings, with the security on the loan provided by“all the order’s possessions in all countries.”36 With this, we may add a verymodern technique of financial elites to our inventory of techniques: 5) Collateralize the infrastructure of nations themselves, particularlyif that infrastructure is being constructed on the basis of loans made by thecorporation.It was inevitable that the super-companies, given their large scale andinternational base of operations, would be drawn into local or regionalconflicts and wars. From 1302–1304, and again in 1314, there were local revoltsof the Flemish populations from France. The Peruzzi, of course, found themselvescaught in the middle, since their lucrative wool trade involved the looms ofFlanders (in what is now Belgium), and we have already seen their penetrationand influence in French mints.They solved this political dilemma by acting as collectors of Flemish debts forthe French monarchy, while simultaneously floating loans—with the customarynegotiated privileges of course—with local Flemish authorities to “help make thepayments possible.”37 Similarly, the Peruzzi, while gaining lucrative privilegesin the Kingdom of Naples, were gaining similar privileges from Naples’ greatrival, the Kingdom of Sicily.38 To be sure, these were accidents of history andconsequences of the international extent of the company, but the Peruzziresponse to the Flemish situation demonstrates just how quickly this highmedieval financial elite learned the lesson that profits could be made from bothsides in a conflict provided the corporation maintained the veneer of publicneutrality. So we may add to our catalogue of techniques: 6) Maintain careful posture of public neutrality in cases of politicalconflict, while continuing to act as financial agents for both sides.39It is important to notice a significant thing here: at this stage in history,while the super-companies and their intellectual descendants fully appreciatedthe utility of “being on both sides” of a conflict, they had not yet come to theinsight that their modern counterparts would realize later in history, arealization that such figures as the great “closet Hermeticist and Magus”Hegel40 would make possible, namely that profit could be generated and extendedthrough the creation of conflict. In short, the medieval super-companies in thisrespect, unlike their modern counterparts, are reactive rather than proactive.But there were other sophisticated techniques as well, and with them, we beginto see the hints of something much darker …b. Accounting and Exchange Techniques [Contents.html#rsec68]As Hunt observes, the Peruzzi company has often been referred to in scholarlyhistories of accounting, and in particular, of the invention of double-entryaccounting, as being in part responsible for its development.41 Indeed, Huntdevotes a whole chapter to the subject, but our purposes are not a history ofaccounting but rather an attempt to inventory the techniques of financial andcorporate oligarchies and elites as they emerged in the Middle Ages.In this respect, Hunt makes a number of statements that are well worth carefulconsideration. The first of these is that the Peruzzi company, like the othermedieval super-companies, kept “secret books.”42 However, before we spring intothe “conspiracy mode” of thinking, it is worth having a closer look at exactlywhat this means, and to do so we must cite Hunt directly: The Assets Book and the Secret Book combine to produce somethingthat at first glance appears broadly similar to the consolidation account of amodern multinational corporation. They contain what look like the openingbalances of the new company carried forward from the old company,43 and theydeal with certain items of income and expense, especially interest, not carriedin the subsidiary books. But their primary function is to house the individualaccounts of depositors and borrowers controlled by the Florence Office, mainlynonshareholders (sic) in the Assets Book and shareholders in the Secret Book.44Thus, with this explanation, the possibility of “double-bookkeeping” and“conspiratorial possibilities” recedes, for the Secret Book was simply theregister of shareholders and their capital exposure in the company.But elsewhere, Hunt reveals precisely what is taking place, using the example ofGiotto d’Arnoldo Peruzzi, who maintained a capital investment in the companyfrom 1300 until 1315, when he began to draw on the company for personal needs.45On the closing of the books in November 1324, however, Giotto’s indebtedness tothe company of 22,018 lira a fiorino was cleared by crediting it with dividendshe was owed and the elimination of “his capital contribution liability”46 of11,000 lira a fiorini. Hunt comments, “This cleanup has the look of what is nowcalled the year-end ‘window-dressing’ applied by modern corporations and banks,and might imply that Giotto’s normal deep indebtedness to the company was beinghidden from the nonfamily shareholders.”47 Similarly, Hunt observes that thecompany actually handled the disbursements to the Peruzzi “family fund.”48 Inother words, the two sets of books really functioned as yet another layer offamilial control of the company, for the family’s benefit, and as a means, ifnot of disguising family dealings from non-family shareholders, then at least ofobfuscating them.But there are even deeper possibilities of obfuscation, and with them weapproach, once again, the Venetian part of the story. In the example of GiottoPeruzzi referred to above, the units of money were the lira a fiorino, and thesewere “not a currency at all, but a fictive unit of account employed by theFlorentine business community.”49 In other words, given the international extentof operations of such companies and the Bardi and the Peruzzi, special “units ofaccount” were created by which companies converted local currencies and managedtheir books.When one considers the addition of the sale and re-sale of bills of exchange,and the bi-metallic ratio of gold to silver bullion, then all sorts ofpossibilities for manipulation begin to occur, as we shall discover when weconsider the Venetian part of this story.The story of the collapse of the Bardi and Peruzzi super-companies, in 1343 and1346 respectively, is intimately tied, as we have observed, not so much to thedefault of Edward III of England, to whom both companies had advanced manyloans, but to the machinations of Venice to expand and secure her position asthe pre-eminent north Italian city-state and hub of a vast maritime tradingempire.The story—and the conspiratorial possibilities—begins as most such stories do,with “discrepancies.” Penetrating beyond the standard academic line that theBardi and Peruzzi were bankrupted after Edward III’s default, Hunt notes thatthe Florentine records on the Peruzzi company’s bankruptcy are “mystifying,” andto such an extent that they leave “the impression that we are being presentedwith a charade.”50 Indeed, Hunt also notes that the Peruzzi family “somehowmanaged to distance itself from the ruin of the company,”51 and even to retaintheir wealth and political power within Florence. (Perhaps those two sets ofbooks had something to do with it, and perhaps there were once records that, forwhatever reason—deliberate or accidental destruction—are no longer extant.)But there are even more anomalies in the collapse of the Peruzzi company, andthe deeper one digs, the more anomalies accumulate. These make the standard linethat the collapse of the Bardi and Peruzzi was due solely to Edward III’sdefault even more problematic, making the academic bewilderment more acute, andmaking the ground for speculative possibilities, like deliberate conspiracy,more fertile.________________________1 Reinhold C.

Thisblurring of the categorical distinctions also played a major role in therecurrent western controversies over predestination and free will. I haveoutlined these two points previously in my published theological works.5 See Farrell and de Hart, Grid of the Gods, pp. 201–217.6 Edwin S. Hunt, The Medieval Super-Companies: A Study of the PeruzziCompany of Florence (Cambridge University Press, 1994), p. 76.7 Hunt, The Medieval Super-Companies, p. 76. This point may seem confusing,given the fact that these partnerships were formed and dissolved by thepartners. But one may gain an understanding of what is actually taking place bythe modern corporate analogue. The partnerships of the various medievalsuper-companies were formed under the sponsorship of the prominent families—theBardi, the Peruzzi—forming them. Thus, several formal partnership orshareholding arrangements could be sponsored by the family under the corporatelogo and the “company” would constitute, over time, several such realignments ofshareholdings. The formation and dissolution of partnerships would be analogousto the sale of shares between shareholders of a modern corporation, the onlydifference being that in the modern corporation, the corporate charter is nolonger formally dissolved and re-registered each time such a realignment ofshareholdings occurs.8 Ibid.9 Hunt, The Medieval Super-Companies, p. 76, emphasis added.10 Hunt, The Medieval Super-Companies, p. 2.11 Ibid., p. 38.12 See Hunt’s remarks on the problems of cash flow that the super-companieshad to confront, ibid., p. 65.13 Ibid., p. 11.14 Ibid., p. 25.15 Ibid, pp. 77, 85, 100.16 Ibid., p. 89.17 Ibid., p. 95.18 Ibid., p. 73, 83.19 See my Babylon’s Banksters, pp. 267–272.20 Hunt, Medieval Super-Companies, p. 16.21 Ibid., pp. 1, 6.22 Ibid., p. 6.23 Ibid., p., 12.24 Hunt notes that Tommaso Peruzzi was an official of the Florentine mint in1311 (see ibid., p. 28).

Seeibid., pp. 19–20. Another way of viewing this is, of course, that behind thepublic veneer of passionate political differences lay the desire to be on bothsides of a conflict.40 By referring to Hegel as a closet Hermeticist and magus, rather thansimply as a philosopher, I am referring to recent trends in academic analysis.See Glenn Alexander Magee’s excellent study, Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition(Ithaca: Cornell University, 2001).41 Hunt, Medieval Super-Companies, p. 101.42 Ibid., p. 7.43 Lest this point seem obscure, it is to be recalled that the capitalizationof each formal organization of the company reflects the relative investments byeach partner, and hence, when the amounts of each partner’s contribution to theorganization of the company changed, the prior partnership arrangement wasdissolved (and profits and losses distributed among the partners), and a newarrangement was created and formalized.44 Ibid., p. 108.45 Ibid., p. 152.46 Ibid., p. 153.47 Ibid., pp. 154–155.48 Ibid., p. 154.49 Ibid., p. 7, emphasis added.50 Ibid., p. 231.51 Ibid., p. 28."},{"pageContent":"[images/chap.jpg][images/chap.jpg] Eight [Contents.html#rch8][images/chap1.jpg][images/chap1.jpg]FLORENTINE FERS-DE-LANCE, PERUZZI PYTHONS, VENETIAN VIPERS, AND THE FINANCIALCOLLAPSE OF THE 1340s [Contents.html#rch8][images/bull3a.jpg]“I have known many bankers in my time. Some of them were lazy; the majorityhowever were very busy, highly intelligent men, indefatigably intent onextending their field of action. They had to, otherwise their banks would havepaid no dividend at the end of the year … In a word, it is stupid to speak of‘the bankers.’”—Dr. Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht1“Venice found distinctive solutions to monetary problems that were common toWestern Europe.”—Frederic C. Lane and Reinhold C. Mueller2“The transfer of accounts on bankers’ books, or ‘giro di partite,’ from whichthe term ‘giro bank’ derives, was the hallmark of Venetian banking.”—Frederic C. Lane and Reinhold C. Mueller3TO ASSUME THAT THE COLLAPSE of the Florentine super-companies, the Bardi andPeruzzi, was due solely to their over-exposure to England’s King Edward III—thatis, to assume that their collapse is explainable along “safe, friendly academiclines”—is to assume that nothing else happened, that there were no “darkconspiratorial hands or signatures” evident.To be sure, those companies were over-exposed in their loans to Edward III, andhad made those loans to him to advance his purposes in the opening phases of theHundred Years’ War. Those purposes may have been in part financial, for one ofEdward’s targets was the textile manufacturers in Flanders. These challengedEdward’s royal monopoly over English textile manufacturing, and in turn, theBardi and Peruzzi companies’ profits, since they had won, through their loans toEdward, the usual “conditionalities”: the right to export wool, and rights, orliens, on certain royal revenues to reimburse their loans. When Edward’scampaigns in Flanders floundered, Edward defaulted on his loans, and the Bardiand Peruzzi were caught in a cash flow crisis that rippled across theircorporate networks from London to Naples. Eventually, they succumbed.That, at least, is, or was, the standard line, until Hunt published his nowindispensable study. There Hunt points out that the default of Edward IIIrepresented a small portion of the dealings of the Bardi and Peruzzi, and that acombination of other natural factors also contributed.So why bring Venice into the picture at all, much less imply that it had somedark or conspiratorial role to play in the demise of the Bardi and Peruzzi?Briefly, there are two reasons that are rather obvious, and a thirdnot-so-obvious reason that, as we shall see, shows the clear hand of Venetianmanipulation. The obvious reasons are that the Bardi and Peruzzi companiesconducted much of their international trade—particularly their lucrative graintrade—with the Kingdom of Naples by leasing Venetian ships. This is a veryimportant point, for it means that Venetian intelligence was faultlesslywell-informed of the scale of the Florentine super-companies’ trading with thatkingdom, and thus were well-informed of their major international competitor’sexposure to foreign trade, and how a disruption of their cash flow could ruinthose competitors’ business.The second reason is even more obvious. Much of the Bardi and Peruzzi’s tradeconsisted of seasonal commodities, as indeed, did much of Venice’s: grain andwool were both of course subject to seasonal change, and the weather and seasonsalso determined, particularly in Venice’s case, when cargo and war galleys wouldsortie. The cyclical regularity allowed the Venetian merchant bankers and theFlorentine super-companies to make predictions on market behavior of allcommodities for these two reasons. Merchants would be most exposed to risk orfailure when the ships were outbound, for it was the returning cargos andcaravans that brought to Florence and Venice the commodities that were sold ormarketed to the rest of Europe, and hence, these returning caravans brought theprofits on the whole trading system.But there is a third, much more hidden, reason for the demise of thesuper-companies, one hidden securely in Venice itself, and in its status as theworld’s bullion market, a status that allowed Venice to manipulate the value ofmoney itself. To appreciate this, one must dig deeply into the structure of thatbullion trade, and even further into the agencies of Venetian oligarchicalgovernment.As a final note before proceeding, as stated in the Preface, the argument thatVenice was behind the collapse of the super-companies has made its rounds on theinternet, with this or that researcher—some quite famous, such asTarpley—stating that Venice not only had a hand, but orchestrated the collapse.In some versions of this idea, the Venetian oligarchy is viewed as “taking out”a rival (Florence), before beginning the transfer of those oligarchicalfamilies’ funds and centers of operation quite deliberately northward, toAmsterdam, and finally London.In making this case, internet articles often refer to the work of Hunt, and twoother scholars of the period, Frederic Chapin Lane and Reinhold C. Mueller, andtheir magisterial works Money and Banking in Medieval and Renaissance Venice:Volume 1: Coins and Moneys of Account, and Mueller’s The Venetian Money Market:Vol. 2: Banks, Panics, and the Public Debt: 1200–1500. But in referring to theseworks, those articles and researchers have often committed the standard errorregrettably found so much within the alternative research and truth community:they simply fail to reference with any exactitude, leaving the reader to “takethem at their word.”This “conspiratorial” interpretation of events—that Venice had a hand in thecollapse of the Bardi and Peruzzi, and even orchestrated the crisis, that Venicewas manipulating the global bullion market, and that its oligarchy (and that ofthe other northern Italian city-states) eventually transferred their familyfortunes or fondi and base of operations northward to Amsterdam and eventuallyLondon—is far too important an hypothesis to be left to mere assertion, withoutspecific referencing and a closer argumentation.With that in mind, we may now proceed …A. BASICS OF MEDIEVAL MONETARY SYSTEM AND THE VENETIAN BULLION TRADE[Contents.html#rsec69]1. The Structure of Florentine Super-Companies’ Trade, and the Interface withVenetian Bankers [Contents.html#rsec70]The first thing we must note is that during the early fourteenth century, whenthe Bardi and Peruzzi companies were at the height of their power, it wasactually they, and not the Venetian bankers, who were the “internationalmerchant bankers” of the day. Indeed, these super-companies were internationalcommodities traders first and foremost, and loans to various royal houses suchas the Kingdom of Naples or Edward III’s England were made in pursuit of gainingtrading concessions or monopolies, and in the hopes of attaching corporate lienson royal revenues and taxes in order to repay the loans that they had advanced.In this sense, they became the defining prototypes of “international merchantbankers.” But by dint of their leasing of Venetian shipping to accomplish allthese goals, they had to deal with the deposit bankers of the Venetian Rialto.4As a result, insofar as the Bardi and Peruzzi conducted day-to-day business fortheir shipping, this was done by interfacing with the Venetian banks.5Again, the reasons are relatively simple to appreciate. Europe was at that time,just as it was until very recently in its history, a tapestry of small kingdoms,duchies, and city-states, each with their own coinage, and each system ofcoinage with its own standards of weight, fineness, bullion content, and so on.Additionally, most of these states were part of a vast trading network flowingthrough Genoa and Venice with the Middle and Far East, with their systems ofcoinages, weights, fineness, and so on. By the nature of the case, then,Venetian bankers on the Rialto, even when conducting business transactionslargely occurring within the city itself, had to be competent at dealing withmany different systems of coinage and with exchange rates of gold and silverbullion on a daily basis. For international companies like the Bardi andPeruzzi, they were indispensible.6 By now the reader will have guessed that thisis the “soft underbelly” of their business, for as we shall discover, there wereavailable to these bankers a variety of means—all perfectly legal within theVenetian system—of manipulating the bullion supply, and hence, the value ofsilver or gold-based coinage, and therefore, the value of money.One must not make the mistake, however, of assuming that the crisis was broughtabout by the over-use of “fractional reserve banking” on the part of the Bardior Peruzzi, or, for that matter, by the Venetian bankers. At the time of thesuper-companies’ decline and collapse, ca. 1335–1343, they were not engaged inextending bank money credit, that is to say, they were not engaged in fractionalreserve banking (unlike the deposit banks in Venice with which they dealt).7Even then, the use of fractional reserve banking and the extension of bank-moneycredits to governments to finance wars was not a step taken by such bankersuntil later, where it made its first appearance in (you guessed it) Venice.8The implications of this interface between the international merchant bankersrepresented by the Bardi and Peruzzi companies on the one hand, and the VenetianRialto deposit bankers on the other, cannot be lingered over too long, for thoseRialto banks were invariably in the hands of a few small Venetian families, eachwith their own direct ties to the Venetian oligarchical nobility, but alsobecause the Rialto became not only a nerve-center for banking and internationalcommercial transaction, but accordingly became a nerve center for accurateeconomic and political intelligence for the world, based on the analysis of thecommodities trade flowing between East and West through Venice.9Venice thus provided not only the ships by which the Bardi and Peruzzi conductedthe lucrative grain trade with the Kingdom of Naples, providing the verylifeblood of food for Florence, but that trade also involved Venetian middlemenin yet another way, since that grain was paid for in gold or silver coins andbullion, and Venice, of course, was by far and away the world’s largestconcentrated bullion market at that time, about which more in a moment. Thepoint here to be remembered is that if there is a sudden or drastic shift in therelationship of gold and silver bullion or coinage exchange rates, then thevalue of gold-based or silver-based money will change accordingly, and with it,the Florentine super-companies’ ability to conduct their commodities trade.10And again, all of this would have been well-known to the Venetian oligarchicalnoble families through their banks’ intelligence gathering capabilities, as wellas through their contacts within the Venetian government, for it will berecalled that the agencies of the Venetian government were similarly allcontrolled by the same families.To reinforce this point, it is worth noting that prior to 1300, there had been a“silver glut” in Europe, with the result that gold rose in value against silver,leading the nobility in Florence to mint a new gold florin,11 which quicklybecame a standard of value in international trade of the day, a kind ofequivalent to a modern “reserve currency” in international commercial exchange.The result, so far as account keeping was concerned, provides us our first clueof the looming and sinister hand of the Venetian oligarchical bankers in theFlorentine crisis, and it is best to allow Lane and Mueller to state the clearoutlines of the shadow: Since Florence was coining gold at the same time, however,whereas Venice coined gold only later, Florence had less need then for a moneyof account based on fine silver to serve as a standard of value. Its lira afiorini was based on fine silver to serve as a standard of value. Its lira afiorini was based on both gold and silver only very briefly. After 1296 it clungto the gold connection. All the accounts of the Bardi and Peruzzi, greatFlorentine firms of international merchant-bankers of the fourteenth century,were kept in lire, soldi, and denari a fiorini, with regular conversions offiorini d’oro into lire, soldi, and denari a fiorini by use of the equation 1fiorini d’oro=29/20 lira a fiorini.12This requires a little unpacking.Very simply put, the Florentine super-companies, the Bardi and Peruzzi, werestill keeping books in terms of silver-based coins or “moneys of account”—thelire, soldi, and denari—while the value of gold continued to rise to the pointthat it became prudent to coin the gold florin, which became, as noted, aninternationally-used standard of exchange and value. So long as thegold-to-silver exchange ratio remained more or less stable, the calculations onthe account books of the Bardi and Peruzzi would remain stable, and so wouldtheir liquidity.Notably, while the Florentine city-state, equally in the hands of its ownoligarchical-financial class as Venice, was coining its new gold florin, Venicewas attempting to defend the value of its silver grosso, which had been, up tothat time, the standard of value in international exchange, until mints in theMiddle East started to issue close “clones” of the Venetian grosso with lesssilver content but the same stated value. As a result, the “bad” Middle Easternmoney began to drive out the Venetian grosso, while Genoa, like Florence, beganto mint and issue gold coins.Succinctly stated, there was a wholesale “coinage war” taking place betweenVenice, Florence, Genoa, and the Middle East at the period the Bardi and Peruzzientered their prime and decline, as each city-state (and the sultans of theMiddle East) struggled to control the bullion trade via the process of makingtheir coinage the standard for international trade.This is the key, for Venice meant to dominate that bullion and coinage war, andto protect its dominant position in the global trade between western Europe andthe Far East that flowed through Venice and the Middle East. Venice wasattempting to defend its silver grosso.13 It was a gold versus silver war, andgiven Venice’s dominant position in the bullion exchange trade and its abilityto manipulate that trade, and hence, the value of money, it was a struggle thatFlorence, like the Middle Eastern mints, was destined to lose.We must now pause to note yet another contributing factor, and thereby yetanother indicator of Venetian manipulation, behind the collapse of the Bardi andPeruzzi super-companies. By the middle to late 1330s Florence was involved inyet another of the many “mini-wars” that so often occurred in northern Italy forsupremacy between the various city-states. The Bardi and Peruzzi companies wereheavy financial backers of the Florentine cause. Venice was a Florentine ally inthat war, until Venice concluded a separate peace, leaving the Florentinecompanies—the Bardi and Peruzzi chief among them—over-exposed and unable torecoup their loans through war booty. So outraged was Florence that thecity-state passed a law forbidding all trade with the Venetians and any of theirterritories, a law which only made the financial crisis deepen for thesuper-companies, for after all, their ability to exchange various coins dependedin large part on the bankers of the Rialto.14 The precise timing of the Venetianwithdrawal from the war suggests quite strongly that the ultimate motivation forits involvement in the war was simply to over-extend the super-companies, aspart of a long-term strategy of attack on the value of Florence’s money and thebasis of its international trade, the gold florin.15This pattern only deepens the more deeply one digs into the details, but we havealready pinpointed the soft underbelly of Florentine trade in the quotation ofLane and Mueller on the gold florin, and the silver-based monies of account. Themeaning of this two-fold system is revealed by a further considerationintroduced by Hunt: One other explanation for the reduction in company profitabilitythat deserves consideration is the effect of the well-known changes in thegold-silver ratio in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Grosslyoversimplified, this ratio was said to be important to Florentine businessmenbecause a significant part of their expense, especially wages, was incurred insilver or billon coinage,16 while their sales in the international markets weremainly in gold florins. An increase in the price of gold relative to silver wasthus expansionary and favorable to business interests, while a decrease wasdepressing and unfavorable to them.17In other words, a change of gold-to-silver exchange rates, if effected quicklyenough and in conjunction with other factors (such as embroiling thesuper-companies in a war, and then suddenly pulling out of that war), could ruinFlorentine international trade and greatly magnify its domestic economicproblems. And the result, of course, of the collapse of the Bardi and Peruzziwas that Florence never again became the major international competitor toVenice it had been.Before we can turn to that, however, a final few words about the bankruptcy ofthe Bardi and Peruzzi companies is necessary in order to properly set the stagefor our closer examination of Venice’s hidden manipulations during the wholeaffair.As we noted in the previous chapter, the logic of the corporate person doctrinewas developed in response to a theological doctrine based on a Latinmistranslation of the original Greek of Romans 5:12, and in that seculardevelopment, the individual partners of a corporation such as the Bardi andPeruzzi were not exempt from personal liability if the corporation failed. Yet,as we also noted, there are indicators that the whole bankruptcy was acharade.18 But what are these indicators?They are quite disturbing, and in them we discover yet another part of the“oligarchical playbook.” Hunt observes that when the Bardi and Peruzzi finallycollapsed, the Peruzzi company itself created the meme that it was the defaultof Edward III of England that precipitated the crisis. Yet, upon examination ofthe Assets and Secret Books of the company, there is not a single mention of anyadvances from the company to the Florentine city-state, nor to Edward III, butsimply advances to King Federigo of the Kingdom of Sicily.19One may add to this the unusual behavior of the Peruzzi shareholders after thepublic disclosure that the company was bankrupt, for they remained in Florencefor a full month after the company’s collapse,20 and then suddenly fled. Thisprompted the government of Florence to issue an amnesty to twenty-two Peruzzishareholders to allow them to return to the city without threat of prosecution,in order to get to the bottom of what had happened. The terms of the amnesty arethemselves illuminating, for they stated that these shareholders “would be freeto reenter the city to defend themselves against charges of having transferredcompany or personal assets beyond the reach of the syndicate … Some of the nameswere of men from the foreign branches… .”21 While Hunt does not actually comeout and state what is going on here, it is easy to see: the company was beingused by the family to transfer its personal assets out of Florence and to thebranches of the family in northern Europe, and chief among these branches wasthe English branch.22 The same phenomenon occurred with the Bardi family, wherePhilip de Bardi continued to head a powerful and independent Bardi Englishbranch, and Walter de Bardi was Edward III’s mint master!23 We shall encounter asimilar oligarchical pattern of the transference of their family financialfortune, and base of operations, northward once again with Venice. The head ofthe Bardi and Peruzzi hydras in Florence had been severed, but the companies, orrather the familiar power they represented, survived.2. The Venetian “Grain Office” and the Council of Ten: Tools of the Oligarchs[Contents.html#rsec71]With these facts and insights in hand, we may now once again turn our attentionto Venice itself.It is worth noting that the infamous Venetian “Council of Ten” was establishedin 1310, just as the Bardi and Peruzzi were entering their period of greatestgrowth, and just as the amount of gold and silver on the European market beganto shift. One may gain an appreciation of just how incestuous the relationshipbetween this Council of Ten—a combination star chamber with summary judicialpowers and intelligence and counter-intelligence agency—and the Venetian banksand oligarchical families really was by noting that by ca. 1390, the Council ofTen allowed bankers to assign silver to the Venetian mint, which was then coinedinto Venetian coin of the realm and returned to the bankers, who, under theterms of the “arrangement,” agreed to loan it to the government!24 In otherwords, while it is strictly true that Venice had no central bank in the modernsense, the Council of Ten, by granting such favors and privileges to variousprivate banks, served the essential functions of one. In its own way, it was atypically Venetian expedient of appearing not to favor such direct and openoligarchical practices, while pursuing them behind a byzantine mechanism ofcouncils and committees of the state, all in the hands of the oligarchicalclass.The other great tool of Venetian oligarchy was the “Grain Office.” While many ofthe dealings with the Grain Office we shall review postdate the period of thecollapse of the great Florentine super-companies, they are reviewed here for themanner in which they clarify the operational mentality of the Venetian oligarchythat was reviewed in chapters two [Chapter002.html] and three [Chapter003.html].By 1256 the Grain Office, or Camera Frumenti, was in existence,25 and like theCouncil of Ten established in 1310, was in full operation during the Florentinecrisis. Bankers quickly turned to it to deposit their coins, and thus for theapproximate century-long period of its operative power, it functioned, asMueller observed, as a kind of Swiss bank to the financial elite of Venice.26One of the key noble families with large deposits in the Grain Office, andhence, with large influence in its affairs, was the d’Este family, whom we shallencounter again.27The key here is that since the Grain Office was an agency of the VenetianRepublic, the state “had use of the money, for its own extraordinaryexpenses.”28 When one looks more closely at those “purposes,” however, onebegins to see another oligarchical pattern, for the Grain Office in turn made“occasional loans to Venetian entrepreneurs, mostly but not solely nobles, insectors involving the common good—mills for grinding wheat and kilns for bakingbricks and roof tile, above all … ”29 In this the Grain Office functioned in amanner similar to the American Pentagon today, as the rewarder of lucrativecontracts to defense industries for various projects affecting the security ofthe state as a whole. Mueller puts it this way: Alongside loans to the state, this financial institution alsomade long-term loans to private entrepreneurs, more often than not nobles, uponauthorization and in areas of strategic importance for the Venetian economy.30It even made loans to the Byzantine Emperor in Constantinople, with the imperialcrown jewels listed on the account books of the Grain Office as collateral.31The Grain Office thus functioned not only as a kind of “Swiss bank” but also asa kind of Federal Reserve,32 since it administered both public and privatefloating debt,33 making it also oftentimes the center of various intriguesbetween the nobles and bankers maintaining deposits, or the entrepreneursreceiving loans. Interestingly enough, and predictably enough, deposits weresought by the state initially to obtain the necessary funds to make grainpurchases, with the grain itself—Venice’s food supply—being the collateral onthe loans.34Finally, emphasizing the ever-present connection in Venetian oligarchicalarrangements between the nobility, the financial power, intelligence, and thestate, it is also important to observe that the Grain Office was the financialagent to the Council of Ten.35Curiously and conveniently (or perhaps not), the archives of the Venetian GrainOffice have been “completely lost,”36 leaving modern researchers to piecetogether its story from other records and accounts of foreigners seekingpermission to make deposits at the Office. In this, too, there is perhapsanother footprint of the Venetian oligarchy, deliberately concealing itsinternal factional strife and activities, while presenting a united frontoutwardly. It is also interesting, and perhaps also a testament to oligarchicalmaneuvering, to note that a century later, after the collapse of the Florentinesuper-companies and when Venice was at the height of her power, that the GrainOffice was dissolved, and the bankers of the Rialto stepped openly on to thescene to administer the Most Serene Republic’s floating public debt.37One episode highlights the duplicitous nature of the Venetian oligarchy ingeneral, and with respect to the Grain Office in particular. This we may hererefer to as the “Cangrande Affair.” That we know about this matter at all is dueto the fact that records of its resolution were drawn up in Venice by theProcurators of San Marco—yet another important Venetian oligarchical agency ofstate, which unfortunately time does not permit us to explore in depth—and oneCangrande II della Scala, a nobleman of yet another Italian city-state, Verona.Making a very long and complicated story short,38 Cangrande made a deposit tothe grain bank that was claimed by an heir (a certain Fregano, whose nobilitythe Venetians disputed), and after much haggling, he managed to press his claimto the point where the Venetian authorities were not able to deny it legally.The problem was, the claim against the Grain Office and hence against theVenetian state itself had grown, with interest, to the extraordinary sum of some250,000 ducats,39 a sum the Venetians clearly did not want (and perhaps did nothave the means) to pay. The Venetian disputes over his nobility were doubtlessan attempt to evade payment of the massive amount of money, and additionally,there were two failed assassination attempts against him which, in Mueller’scareful phrasing, “in time involved important organs of the state.”40 Whenassassinations and delays failed to deter Fregano, a compromise was finallyreached, whereby Fregano agreed to quit his claim against the Grain Office, andin return Venice agreed to pay him an annuity of 1,500 ducats, to include 1,000ducats after his death to his male heirs41 (heirs, it might be noted, who couldeasily be subjected to the same tactics of evasion, payment avoidance, andassassination). In other words, the Venetian oligarchs had simply refused to paywhat they owed, resorted to threats, violence, evasions, and eventually wereable to “re-negotiate” their obligations, doubtless against an exasperated andexhausted opponent who wanted to realize at least some beneficial outcome fromthe ordeal. For the oligarchs, it was a boon, for they had effectivelynegotiated their obligation down to a few pennies on the ducat, so to speak.The Cangrande Affair highlights an important function of the Grain Office, foras we have seen, it became the locus of Venetian financial dealings with the“seignorial families elsewhere in central-northern Italy and even in theBalkans.”42 It was, to highlight the point once again, one of the crucial chokepoints through which the Council of Ten and the Venetian Republic gained theflow of intelligence so crucial to the conduct of their trade, exchange, andempire. By the time that the Grain Office had declined and bank loans to thestate were made openly by banks on the Rialto, the functions of the Grain Officein administering the Council of Ten’s funds for its various nefarious activitieshad also been taken over by the banks directly, even to the point of a “newopenness in business,” such that one request to a Rialto banker from thegovernment was for a loan to offer a reward for the assassination of Venice’senemies (in this case, King Sigismund and Brunoro della Scalla, in 1415)!43Before returning to the main theme of the collapse of the Florentineinternational merchant bankers, and leaving the Grain Office and its eventualreplacement by the direct funding of the Venetian state debt by the privatebankers of the Rialto—always remembering that these banks in many cases weredirectly connected to the very same oligarchy running the state—one should alsonote that the period of the highest lending to the state by the banks wasprecisely coterminous with the period of Venice’s decline.443. The Venetian International Bullion Trade, or, Manipulating the GlobalEast/West Gold/Silver Bullion Flow for Oligarchical Fun and Profit[Contents.html#rsec72]If one were to rely solely upon academic histories of the decline of themedieval super-companies, or upon more general academic histories such asFernand Braudel’s massive The Perspective of the World, or even upon the studiesof Hunt, Lane, and Mueller, one would never come away with anything more thanperhaps a faint “whiff” of something malodorous, something “wrong” hovering justbehind the tidy histories, or just beyond the limits of perception. It is whenone reads those studies closely, comparing notes, connecting dots, that thepattern begins to emerge.But one cannot hold one’s nose forever, and even academics sometimes noticesomething is wrong. Hunt perhaps caught some whiff of this odor when he pointedout that one possible, and indeed plausible, reason for the decline of the Bardiand Peruzzi was the relatively sudden shift of silver-gold bullion exchangeratios, as noted earlier in this chapter.45 Hunt even went further, and pointedout the curious examples of gold and silver bullion exchange ratios cited inLane’s exhaustive Money and Banking in Medieval and Renaissance Venice. Let usrefresh our memory about what Hunt said: One other explanation for the reduction in company profitabilitythat deserves consideration is the effect of the well-known changes in thegold-silver ratio in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Grosslyoversimplified, this ratio was said to be important to Florentine businessmenbecause a significant part of their expense, especially wages, was incurred insilver or billon coinage, while their sales in the international markets weremainly in gold florins. An increase in the price of gold relative to silver wasthus expansionary and favorable to business interests, while a decrease wasdepressing and unfavorable to them.46Hunt went on to say this: There is abundant evidence that the price of gold in terms ofsilver had been rising steadily in Italy from the middle of the thirteenthcentury until it peaked at around 14 ounces of silver for one ounce of gold(14:1) in Venice and Florence in the late 1320s. Then the ratio began to movefirmly in favor of silver during the 1330s and 1340s, provoking the severecoinage devaluations in Florence of 1345 and 1347. Lane and Mueller place theturning point in 1327, when the rulers of Bohemia and Hungary agreed tocoordinate the coinage of silver groats … The relationship of the price of gold to silver was ofcourse reflected mostly in currency rates of exchange, although it was just oneof many variables involved in determining specific rates between differentcoinages in specific locations … The florin moved quite strongly against thesoldi of Florence, Siena, Pisa, and Genoa, although much less so against thecurrencies of Naples, England, France, and Venice.47Thus, as Hunt also points out, the relatively quick demise of the gold to silverratio “contributed importantly to the demise of the Florentine super-companiesin three ways.”48 As we already have observed, Florence’s international tradewas conducted in gold florins, whereas its domestic costs were handled insilver, and thus, the terms of trade for importing commodities, the basis of thesuper-companies’ business, were made higher with the decline of gold relative tosilver. Secondly, and even more critically, when the Bardi and Peruzzi madeloans, the loans were stipulated in gold, and thus when they were repaid in goldthat had diminished in value, they lost money in the transaction. Finally, asHunt also notes, “the Florentines imported gold and exported the undervaluedsilver on a large scale in the early 1340s, intensifying an already ruinousdeflation. In this connection, the Florentines, unlike the Venetians who werethe prime silver traders in the Mediterranean, were not in a position to offsettheir losses by profitable trading in the Levantine silver markets,”49 a marketto which, of course, Venice had easy access.But, says Hunt, “These arguments, while persuasive to a point, are seriouslyflawed as explanations for the downfall of the super-companies.”50 At best, Huntnotes, the gold-silver ratio and the decline of gold “added to the problems ofthe super-companies”51 to be sure, but this did not have a “significantinfluence on their results”52 in that the Peruzzi companies had sustained heavylosses already from 1331–5, prior to the gold-silver exchange problem.However, even with all that said, Hunt does acknowledge that something was goingon, something beyond simple coordination of dates, events, and gold-silverratios, when he admits that the Florentines were not “great internationalbullion traders like the Venetians.”53 It would seem, then, that a much closerlook is in order, and Hunt himself points the direction where we must look.We must look, once again, at the research of Frederic Chapin Lane and ReinholdC. Mueller.a. Coins, Bullion, Mints, and “Seigniorage” [Contents.html#rsec73]The complicated case of Lane and Mueller lies beneath a mass of details, andthese we must unpack very carefully in order to make the case that onecontributory factor in the demise of the Florentine super-companies was indeedVenetian oligarchical manipulation.We will begin with bullion, coins, mints, and the concept of “seigniorage.”Money within medieval and renaissance Europe meant primarily two things: (1)virtual, or “bank” money, created on the ledgers of banks and transferred fromone account to another, and by extension, through the trading and discount ofbills of exchange from one location to another by international merchants suchas the Bardi and Peruzzi, and (2) “real” money, or bullion and coinage, which,as noted previously in this chapter, came in three kinds: a) Yellow money: gold coinage, used primarily in international trade b) White money: silver coinage c) Black money: copper coinage or coins struck with alloys of silver andcopper. These latter two kinds of coinage were principally used in local anddomestic exchange.54Within city-states famous for their banking houses and families, such asFlorence, Genoa, and Venice, the variety of coins both foreign and domestic incirculation and being exchanged in the banks (not to mention that within eachsystem of coinage there was essentially a “tri-metallic”55 system) meant thatthese banks, and the super-companies like the Bardi and Peruzzi, maintainedtheir ledgers in several different moneys of account.56Effectively, however, this “tri-metallic” system was a bi-metallic system, inthat even in the so-called “black money,” it was the presence of silver in thealloy of the coin that gave it its relative value. The careful reader will nowhave noted that there are two possibilities for manipulation that immediatelyopen up: 1) the first possibility for manipulation occurs in the accounting ofbanks and corporations themselves, based on manipulations between various moneysof account, which is in turn based upon 2) the gold-to-silver ratio of bullion exchange.It will be recalled from chapter six [Chapter006.html] that the value of coinsin turn was dependent largely on two factors: first, the bullion content of thecoin itself, about which more in a moment, and the stamp of value, the mint ofthe coin itself, which stated a legally defined value, often in excess of theintrinsic value of the bullion itself. The intrinsic value of the bullion wasmeasured by weight, and fineness, and this constituted part of its exchangevalue, which gives rise to the second possibility of manipulation mentionedabove. Lane and Mueller put the point this way: When differences in bimetallic ratios were large and persistent,merchants collected for export coins of the metal more highly valued elsewhere.As soon as their market value in bullion exceeded their legal value, they became“good” money … and were subject to being driven out by “bad” money made of themetal that was legally overvalued. With bimetallic ratios changing as much as 20percent within a decade or two during the Middle Ages, the export of undervaluedcoins repeatedly destroyed efforts to maintain a stable bimetallic standard.57For Venice, which controlled the bullion market of Europe, and as we shall seemost of Europe’s silver production as well, the export or import of gold from orto Europe was a simple matter. By manipulating the supply, Venice could forcethe value of one or the other forms of bullion, and hence the coins based uponit, to rise or fall, wreaking havoc with the coinage of a putative opponent.Let us take one simple example. If, say, a silver coin was used in a transactionduring a period when the intrinsic value of the bullion in the coin exceeded thelegally defined value of the coin in transactions, merchants and bankers coulddemand that payments to them be made in the telling, or tell, of coins—“telling”simply being the counting out of coins in payment of an obligation or settlementof a transaction. Conversely, in paying out on a transaction, they could insiston weighing the coins as the statement of value being transferred during thetransaction.This difference between weighing and telling leads us to the next component ofthe complexity of medieval and Renaissance money: the mint. During this period,the very act of minting or making coins—“real money”—was still held to be theprerogative of the state, not a particular private central bank. As such, mintswere expected to contribute revenue to the state. A mint, Lane and Mueller note,“paid out for a given weight of silver or gold bullion somewhat fewer coins thanthe number made from the bullion.”58 This difference was, effectively, a kind oftax on bullion sales to the mint, and this difference was called “seigniorage,”representing the profit to the government for coining bullion.59There is a catch in the system, however, since each prince, and in the case ofthe Italian city-states in close proximity to each other, each city-state, hadits own mint. Thus, competition would arise between various mints, and mintscould be used as a means for attacking the money-minting monopoly ofcompetitors.60 The method of doing so was relatively simple. Cheaper products,or coins of lesser bullion purity, or “fineness,” could be minted with stampsvery similar, or even identical, to that of a competitor. The result was thatthe mint issuing such coinage increased the bullion flow and reserves of itsmint, since less purity was involved in its coinage issue. Such an act, Lane andMueller observe, “was considered an act of hostility close to armed conflict.”61Coinage, in other words, presented limitless opportunities for manipulation, andwhen coupled to the ability to manipulate the bullion ratio of gold and silveritself, the possibilities multiply like rabbits. With this in mind, it is nowunderstandable why Venice required accounting by tell, and not by weight.62There were other manipulation possibilities. For example, by charging highseigniorage, the export of coins out of a particular sovereignty could beinhibited, “because it increased the difference between their exchange value andthat of the metal they contained.”63b. Banksters, Coinage, and Tactics of Manipulation of the Money Supply[Contents.html#rsec74]Thus far, we have been dealing with the possibilities open to governments forthe manipulation of the value of coinage. But in a republic such as Venice,where the functions of government and finance were in the hands of an oligarchy,the possibilities for manipulation become even greater when one considers howthe banks of the Rialto could add their own unique technique to the inventory.This is made even more explicit when one takes note of the fact that theVenetian mint was firmly in the control of its nobility.64Bankers and merchants could deliberately withhold, or “cull,” coins of relative“newness” or “proof”, i.e., coins that had not yet been widely circulated andhence experienced the inevitable wear and tear and reduction of weight. Theycould also “clip” the coins, i.e., shave off a minute portion of the bullion ofthe coin, collecting a stockpile of such shavings and then melting them down forexport or sale to the local mint, whichever was more profitable. Similarly,culling had the effect of reducing the amount of money in circulation, and thusraising the relative stamped monetary and intrinsic weight value of the coinsthat were in circulation.65If this sounds familiar to readers of my previous book, Babylon’s Banksters, itis, but for those who have not read it, here in essence is how the ancientfinancial elite managed the transition from those exchangeable clay tablets ofcredit, to coinage: 1) Penetrate and ally with the temple, to give the financial activitiesof that elite the aura of probity associated with religion;66 2) Issue false receipts, that is, simply circulate counterfeit claytablets, thus destabilizing the money supply and its value;67 3) Substitute bullion for letters of credit (i.e., for those circulatingclay tablets), as a “secure” measure against counterfeit, or false, receipts;68and finally, 4) Create the facsimile of money, new letters of credit against thebullion.69As I pointed out in that book, crucial to this activity is the practice ofculling, or hoarding, i.e., the deliberate removal from circulation of competingmoneys, namely, the legitimate letters of credit or clay tablets, whilesubstituting into circulation the false ones, and, eventually, the bullion-basedones.c. Venice, the East/West Gold/Silver Flow, Moneys of Account, and Indicators ofManipulation During the Bardi-Peruzzi Crisis [Contents.html#rsec75]We now come to the central issue, the manipulation of the relative amounts ofgold to silver bullion in Western Europe, and to the role of Venice in doing so.Venice, by dint of her position astride East-West trade, straddled the Europeanbullion market like a colossus.And the key here, as so many centuries before with the trade of Rome with theOrient, was how the two regions of the world respectively valued gold and silverbullion. As I pointed out in Babylon’s Banksters, the West (Rome) tended tovalue gold more highly, and the Orient, silver.70 Venice, since it virtuallycontrolled most of this bullion flow, represented in this respect a continuationof the “bullion brokers” of ancient times, and in this, one may have yet anotherloose corroboration that its banking practices—passed down through the ages bythe noble families constituting its oligarchy—are themselves a testament orindicator that perhaps those families constitute an unbroken connection toancient times and similar financial elites.The relative regional supplies of gold and silver, in other words, could beorchestrated to flood one region with one kind of bullion (thereby reducing itsvalue and the value of coinage minted in that bullion), while causing a “famine”of that kind of bullion in another region, then reversing the process, all thewhile culling and clipping according to the dictates of the overall trend.In this respect, Lane and Mueller produce a table in their work showing the bestestimates of the gold to silver ratios during the crucial period from 1310 to1350, the period of the rise and collapse of the great Florentine merchantsuper-companies. In 1310—the year of the founding of the Venetian Council ofTen—the silver to gold ratio was 14:1. But by 1350, this had dropped, somewhatprecipitously, to 10:1.71 This drop, plus the fact that different moneys ofaccount were in use, all based or attached more or less to units of gold andsilver coinage72—oftentimes within the same corporate entity—could also presentother opportunities to play financial havoc with a merchant or governmentcompetitor. Indeed, as Mueller notes in his scholarly sequel to his and Lane’sjoint work, the bullion trade in Venice peaked sharply, precisely at the time ofthe Bardi and Peruzzi crisis.But there was one unique feature of Venetian banking used locally by mostmerchants in the city, and that was the banchi di scritta—banks that wouldsimply transfer, from one account to another, sums of money on their books inpayments of transactions, rather than the transfer of coins or specie itself.They became, in the apt expression of Lane and Mueller, the “common bookkeepers”for the entire community,73 and eventually for the Venetian state itself. Thishad the effect of freeing coinage and specie for international trade (and thus,for currency speculations of the sorts we have been outlining), while allowingdomestic trade to continue.74 In effect, they vastly expanded the money supplyof Venice, and her ability therefore to draw—to the perplexity of hercompetitors—on a seemingly inexhaustible supply of money to fund her trade andwars. This transference on the ledgers of the banchi di scritta also greatlysimplified, and sped up, the pace at which business could be conducted inVenice, since it avoided the lengthy process of telling and weighing coins.75With the increased speed and efficiency of circulation, the wealth of therepublic expanded.In other words, with such concentrations of power, of intelligence gatheringcapabilities represented by the Venetian merchants, banks, governmentinstitutions such as the Grain Office or the Council of Ten, and the ability tomanipulate the bullion supply and value of money, it is difficult to avoid theconclusion that, all other factors considered, Venice at least played asignificant and deliberate role in the demise of the Florentine super-companies.This conviction can only grow when we look back once again to the duplicitousbehavior of Venice during the Fourth Crusade, and to the behavior of the famous(or, depending on one’s lights, infamous) “Blind Doge” Dandolo prior to thecrusading army’s departure for what it hoped would be Egypt. It will be recalledthat Dandolo, through a combination of skullduggery, blatant manipulation, andByzantine intrigue (in the literal sense!), managed to divert the Crusade toConstantinople itself. It is a little known fact, often completely overlooked inmedieval history textbooks, that Enrico Dandolo caused the Venetian mint toissue—prior to the Fourth Crusade—a new silver coin that was a virtual copy ofthe Byzantine “hyperpyron”76—for trade with the Middle East, virtually assuringthat the coin would supplant the Byzantine imperial issue, which is exactly whathappened, obviously increasing both in value and in quantities in circulationafter Venice gained outright control of regions of the Eastern Empire after theFourth Crusade. Eventually, the coin of Dandolo became the “basis for aninternational standard of value for the region.”77Since Venice conducted trade with the Orient, which valued silver as a general“cultural” phenomenon more highly than gold,78 it became necessary for Venice tocontrol the production of silver in Europe as much as possible. This, of course,was made possible through its relationship to the famous German merchant bankingand silver mining family, the Fuggers, who, incidentally, were trained in thetechniques of banking and accounting, in Venice.As silver was flowing Eastward through Venice, gold coincidentally was flowingwestward, through Venice, and into Europe, and—again “coincidentally”—in thespring of the year of the Peruzzi bankruptcy, 1343, a very large shipment ofgold arrived in Venice from places that ranged from Constantinople, to Tana, theVenetian outpost on the Black Sea, and perhaps even as far away as the interiorof Asia,79 all of which suggest a vast and coordinated effort, requiring a largeand extensive intelligence network such as Venice possessed.But the real clue, the final nail in the coffin so to speak, comes with twoobservations that Lane and Mueller record in their magisterial study. Theseobservations clearly indicate that the Bardi and Peruzzi companies were caughtin a bullion vice of Venetian manufacture: Exchange rates used in the account books of the big Florentinefirm of the Peruzzi for 1335–37 varied in a range indicating bimetallic ratiosof about 13 to 1 to 16 to 1. A more decisive drop came in 1337, when the Frenchminted the gold piece called in England the florin de l’écu. It was given aprice that expressed the ratio 11.5 to 1, the same as the ratio set in Venice ahalf-dozen years earlier with the coinage of the soldino, in 1331–1332.80In other words, the Peruzzi ledgers reflected a fantasy world, divorced from thegold glut that Venice was introducing into Western Europe as it wassimultaneously exporting German silver to the East!81 It is worth citing thecarefully worded evaluation of Lane and Mueller in this respect: Although the gold glut cannot be considered the main cause ofFlorence’s financial crisis, the voluminous minting of gold while silver coinwas scarce may have made the deflation worse. Although no modern analogy helpsexplain the conjunction of deepening deflation and increased supplies of gold,monetary conditions of the mid-fourteenth century suggest a connection. Theprofuse coinage of florins in years when silver coins were scarce may havelowered the exchange value of the gold coins. Previously, for almost a century,1250–1330, gold had been rising in value compared with silver. Those who hadaccumulated wealth had found that gold was the best stuff to hoard and thatcredits stated in gold-based money of account, which was likely to be devaluedby the minting of lighter silver … coin … Amid the general loss of confidenceand the resulting need for liquidity, they turned to their gold, only to findthat gold that had been worth more than 14 times as much as silver in 1330 wasworth hardly more than 10 times as much in 1350.82To see even more deeply into just how the Venetian bullion vice had gripped theFlorentine super-companies, and thereby Venetian rival Florence itself, one mustask, and answer, a question: Why had Florence not adjusted earlier its fine silver coinage tothe rising value of silver, the value to which the coinage of France as well asthat of Venice had been adjusted much earlier, before 1340? The answer has two sides. On the one hand, the quattrino83gave all the needed protection against a draining away of the kind of currencyneeded for small and local transactions. On the other hand, the profits of theinternational bankers had come to depend on the exchange rates between florinsand various foreign currencies. Where Florentines made loans in florins andcollected repayment and interest in a local currency based on silver, theyprofited from maintaining an exchange rate that set a high value on gold. InEngland, as the English complained, the Florentines had maintained such a highexchange rate. The vested interest that they as international bankers hadacquired in a high bimetallic ratio gave them reason to maintain a highbimetallic ratio also in Florentine coinage.84Or, to put it more plainly, the Florentine super-companies—and with themFlorence itself—had simply been wrong-footed, and toppled by the gold glut thatgives every indicator of having been orchestrated by the Vipers of Venice. Notfor nothing does Shakespeare’s play bear the title The Merchant of Venice, andnot The Merchant of Florence.B. A FURTHER MEDITATION ON THE TOPOLOGICAL METAPHOR OF THE MEDIUM: ON THE“FINANCIAL PYRAMID” VERSION OF THE METAPHOR [Contents.html#rsec76]We are far, however, from being done with the techniques of financialmanipulation, or, for that matter, the Metaphor and how at a deep cultural andsubconscious level, it had come to be understood and operate. To appreciate thisphenomenon, we must return to a concept that has recurred throughout thischapter, namely, the concept of “moneys of account.” These are, simply stated,the units of value in which various accounts were expressed, and hence, in theMiddle Ages and Renaissance, were always loosely connected to coinage, even whenbeing transferred as mere ledger entries between various banks.But almost immediately a philosophical problem occurs, and it is safe to say itprobably occurred to the medieval bankers as well (after all, once again witnessthe hostility of Venice to Giordano Bruno and to the full implications of theTopological Metaphor of the Medium). Lane and Mueller observe that during the1930s, “just as the gold standard was passing into history,” two very differentways of interpreting the problem of the relationship between coins (andtherewith, bullion) and moneys of account arose. One version, advocated byBelgian numismatist Hans van Werveke, advanced the idea that moneys of accountwere always defined in one of three ways: 1) as a definite weight of gold or silver, usually as embodied in aparticular coin; 2) as a particular coin in general circulation; 3) as “imaginary money, absolutely independent of any ‘real money’ … thatis, of any coin or fixed quantity of precious metal.”85 This third type, vanWerveke maintained, “did not describe any historical reality.”86In contrast, Italian economist Luidi Einaudi argued that moneys of accountrepresented a standard of value used in accounting and contracts, and “real”money used in payments.87In other words, as these economists and historians were studying the MiddleAges, they came face to face with the problem we outlined previously in chaptersix [Chapter006.html]: did the Metaphor come first, or did coinage?We gain an appreciation of the importance of this question by noting, onceagain, that most business transactions in Venice itself were conducted on thebasis of ledger transfers using various moneys of account, all more or lessabstract, and all circulating much faster than local market conditionsreflecting the value of those monies in corresponding coinage. “By creating suchambiguities,” Lane and Mueller observe, “the mobility of moneys of accountlimited or undermined the unity and continuity of monetary standards.”88 This ofcourse was in the control of the Venetian oligarchy that owned the banks, whiledomestic and foreign exchange, conducted in bullion and coinage, was foreveryone else, and there too, the oligarchy virtually controlled the bullionmarket as well.All this brings us chin to chin, once again, with the Topological Metaphor ofthe Medium, and again to the reasons why the Venetians would have so strenuouslyobjected to the construction Bruno put upon it. We may refer to this version ofthe Metaphor as the “Debt Finance Construction.”Here, as always, there are at least two ways to interpret it, one issuing inever-present debt, and the other, in ever-increasing fecundity.In chapter six [Chapter006.html], we saw how the symbolization of the physicalmedium as the empty hyper-set Ø could also represent the bullion substrate ofcoinage, as well as the physical substrate or materia prima of the physicalworld itself. Thus, coins could represent the resulting instantiations, orderivatives, of that substrate, and as common surfaces of transaction. Supposewe now fix the “value” of that original empty hyper-set at “1.” Doing so wouldmean that all subsequent derivatives have a value of less than one. Asderivatives increase, their “value” decreases as fractions of the original.But, as we have seen in this chapter, as coins circulate, that is, as theychange from one context to another, they progressively lose weight, become worn,and so on, thus losing both intrinsic and stamped value. We may express thisphenomenon in our topological metaphorical terms as a kind of recontextualizingrule:[images/f0188-01.jpg]where the subscript “x” denotes the “coin” in its original valuation in aparticular context “x,” say, that of its legally defined and minted value, and“y” denotes a new context into which it has moved, represented by the arrow,with a corresponding incremental loss of value, represented by the partialderivative sign ∂.89 Over time, more and more such recontextualizations will, ofcourse, take their wear and tear on the coin, such that, the amount ofcirculating coins will never sum to the original “value” of “1” from which thesystem began. No matter how much one culls, clips, hoards, and so on, there willalways be an incremental loss in the system. This, briefly put, is how theMetaphor can come to be, by analogy to coinage, interpreted as a Metaphor ofperpetual indebtedness. In this instance, positioning oneself closest to the topof the Metaphor will, of course, result in a pyramid of power associated withit.But as will be evident, there really is no a priori reason to view the metaphoras ever-decreasing fractions of the original “value” of 1. One could equallyview such derivatives as “countable entities,” giving rise to whole numbers. Inthis view of the Metaphor, information simply increases, with no limit, and nofractionalization or “indebtedness.” To the Venetians, ever mindful of theirbullion and money, this prospect of a genuinely open system was in itselfanathema, for in their closed system understanding, it would only beinflationary, and any inflationary prospect was anathema …… unless, of course, they controlled it.But that control was about to be threatened in yet another fashion, and by a newway of opening the system, one perhaps, as we shall now see, they may have knownlong before, and suppressed.It is small wonder that, after centuries of such duplicitous behavior, feignedalliances and sudden withdrawals from them, double-dealing negotiations, coinagewar, bullion manipulation, assassinations, and summary secret trials by theCouncil of Ten, the rest of Europe finally had it, and went to war with Veniceduring the War of the League of Cambrai. The preamble of alliance for the Leagueis worth recalling; the League was formed, it stated, … to put an end to the losses, the injuries, the violations, thedamages which the Venetians have inflicted, not only on the Apostolic See but onthe Holy Roman Empire, on the House of Austria, on the Dukes of Milan, on theKings of Naples and on divers other princes, occupying and tyrannically usurpingtheir goods, their possessions, their cities and castles, as if they haddeliberately conspired to do ill to all around them. Thus we have found it not only will-advised andhonourable, but even necessary, to summon all people to take their just revengeand so to extinguish, like a great fire, the insatiable rapacity of theVenetians and their thirst for power.90As noted above, however, the system was about to be opened in a dramaticfashion, a fashion that the Venetians may have even known about for somecenturies before events, finally, compelled the secret out into the open …________________________1 Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, Confessions of the Old Wizard: TheAutobiography of Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht (Cambridge, MA: HoughtonMifflin, 1956), p. 1.2 Frederic C.

Many reading this book, for example, would question the promotedorthodoxies concerning the assassination of President John F.

The problem of the Piri Reis map may besuccinctly stated as follows: it showed something that had not been discoveredyet, namely Antarctica, as the following picture shows:[images/f0192-01.jpg]Piri Reis map: Note the coast of South America, the west African bulge, andSpain, then, at the bottom of the map, that of AntarcticaThe map immediately caught the attention of science history professor Charles H.Hapgood, [1904–1982] who, with his students, went in search of precedents forthis anomaly, searching ancient medieval maps called portolanos and otherRenaissance world maps. It was not long before they unearthed the famousOronteus Finaeus map of 1532, which, like many maps of the period, clearlydepicted the Terra Australis, as the yet-to-be discovered Antarctic continentwas then known.[images/f0193-01.jpg]Right Side of the Oronteus Finaeus Map of 1531 Showing Antarctica2The problem is obliquely admitted by the skeptical website “Bad Archaeology,”which notes that “Although there are fairly obvious similarities between thegeneral depiction of the southern continent by Oronteus Finaeus and modern mapsof Antarctica, they do not stand up to close scrutiny; indeed, there are moredifferences than similarities, much as one would expect from a map drawn withoutgenuine knowledge of the southern continent!”3 In other words, the problem—forthose willing simply to look—is that long before Captain Cook came close to thecontinent in 1773, and before actual contact was made in 1820, the continent, inspite of inaccuracies in the map, was being depicted more or less accurately,pettifogging tactics of standard academia to deny it notwithstanding.Hapgood recounts his discovery of this anachronistically accurate map: Then one day, I turned a page, and sat transfixed. As myeyes fell upon the southern hemisphere of a world map drawn by Oronteus Finaeusin 1531, I had the instant conviction that I had found here a truly authenticmap of the real Antarctica.The problem with the map as depicted by Oronteus was more than just the generalresemblance of the depicted continent to modern cartographic representations;the problem went much deeper: The general shape of the continent was startlingly likethe outline of the continent on our modern map … The position of the South Pole,nearly in the center of the continent, seemed about right. The mountain rangesthat skirted the coasts suggested the numerous ranges that have been discoveredin Antarctica in recent years. It was obvious, too, that this was no slapdashcreation of somebody’s imagination. The mountain ranges were individualized,some definitely coastal and some not … This suggested, of course, that thecoasts may have been ice-free when the original map was drawn. 4A closer view will allow the reader to see what Hapgood is talking about:[images/f0194-01.jpg]Close-up of Oronteus Finaeus Map of 1532Oronteus Finaeus’ map was not the only such map depicting theyet-to-be-encountered southern polar continent. Hapgood found others, includingthe Hadji Ahmed Map of 1559, once again clearly showing the southern polarcontinent in a Mercator-like projection:[images/f0195-01.jpg]Hadji Ahmed Map of 15595All of this, as Hapgood noted, led some who had encountered such maps,especially the Piri Reis map, to speculate that portions of the coast on theTurkish admiral’s map that lay under the ice and were nonetheless more or lessaccurately depicted must have been mapped “before the ice appeared.”62. Medieval Portolans [Contents.html#rsec79]The problem then became much more acute. Pursuing his quest for ancient mapsthat seemed to embody anachronistically out-of-place accuracy, Hapgood soondiscovered the Dulcert Portolano of 1339, produced by Angelino Dulceti, who,interestingly enough, was probably trained in Genoa, the other great northernItalian merchant city-state with its own exclusive trading privileges with theByzantine Empire, and the great rival of Venice.7 A glance at the DulcertPortolano, though very faded, will immediately show the problem:[images/f0196-01.jpg]Dulcert Portolano of 13398While difficult to see, the outlines of Europe, Asia Minor, and North Africa arefaintly visible in the above picture, raising the questions: why is this map soaccurate, and where did this accuracy come from? How did this knowledge come tomedieval and Renaissance Europe, to spur the voyages that would confirm thatanother world existed, unknown to the Europeans?3. Maps from High Antiquity [Contents.html#rsec80]Enter Venice once again, and all that it symbolized of the great trading rivalryof Venice and Genoa for the Far Eastern trade flowing through Byzantium.In Chapter Two [Chapter002.html], it was noted that the sudden appearance of theHermetica in northern Italy followed the Council of Ferrara-Florence, which was,we also observed, financially sponsored in part by the Medicis of Florence. Wespeculated there that the presence of the Byzantine humanists Bessarion andPlethon among the Greek delegation to the council was the contact point for theFlorentine merchants who may have been seeking lost knowledge that could onlyhave come from the imperial archives of the East Roman Empire in Constantinople.We thus speculate that this contact may have been one route for the suddenappearance of apparently hidden cartographic knowledge of the Earth during thisperiod.But as noted also in chapter three [Chapter003.html], the contacts of Venice andits rival Genoa with the East Roman or Byzantine Empire predate those of thecouncil of Florence by some two centuries, with the Venetian and Genoese virtualmonopolies of ports and tax exemptions within Byzantium. The establishment ofthe Latin Empire after the Fourth Crusade by Venice would have given Veniceaccess to the imperial archives, and thus to the charts and exemplars from whichPiri Reis compiled his map. Similarly, the Genoese access to Byzantium duringthe period of the Venetian-Genoese rivalry would have given them a correspondingaccess. The question is, why did Venice not access and utilize this knowledge?As we saw in chapter three [Chapter003.html], the question is easily answered bya map of the world. Venice could not easily access the Atlantic, for the routewas blocked not only geographically but by the warring Moors and Castillians inSpain. Venice, in other words, if it had access to this cartographic knowledge,could not utilize it, and would have had to suppress the knowledge of it frombeing acquired by anyone else lest its favored position astride the tradingroutes to the Far East be jeopardized, and with it, its whole financial andmercantile empire.The question that remains is whether or not such exemplars of the Piri Reis mapactually existed. If so, then the likelihood of Venetian suppression ofknowledge rises. We have already seen that medieval portolanos existed, and thatthese appear to have been drawn from much earlier exemplars, as Hapgoodcommented: … (One) of the leading scholars in the field did notbelieve that the charts originated in the Middle Ages. A. E. Nordenskiöld, whocompiled a great Atlas of these charts … and also wrote an essay on theirhistory… , presented several reasons for concluding that they must have comefrom ancient times. In the first place, he pointed out that the DulcertPortelano and all the others like it were a great deal too accurate to have beendrawn by medieval sailors. Then there was the curious fact that the successivecharts showed no signs of development. Those from the beginning of the 14thCentury are as good as those from the 16th. It seemed as though somebody earlyin the 14th century had found an amazingly good chart which nobody was able toimprove upon for two hundred years. Furthermore, Nordenskiöld saw evidence thatonly one such model chart had been found and that all the portolanos drawn inthe following centuries were only copies—at one or more removes—from theoriginal. He called this unknown original the “normal portolano” and showed thatthe portolanos, as a body, had rather slavishly been copied from the original.He said: “The measurements at all events show: (1) that, as regards theoutline of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, all the portolanos are almostunaltered copies of the same original; (2) that the same scale of distance wasused on all the portolanos.”9Hapgood notes that Nordenskiöld believed that these measures were derived fromCarthaginian and Phoenician sources.10But that was not all. Nordenskiöld also compared the maps of the most famousancient geographer, Ptolemy, whose maps were introduced to western Europe in the1400s, with the most famous of the medieval portolanos, the Dulcert Portelano.Notably, the medieval map was much more accurate, as Nordenskiöld’s comparisonof the two clearly shows:[images/f0198-01.jpg]Nordenskiöld’s Comparison of the Ancient Geographer Ptolemy’s Map (Top), withthe Medieval Dulcert Portolano (Bottom)11Hapgood minces no words when stating the implications of this comparison: Let us stop to consider, for a moment, what this means. Ptolemyis the most famous geographer of the ancient world. He worked in Alexandria inthe 2nd Century A.D., in the greatest library of the ancient world. He had athis command all the accumulated geographical information of that world. He wasacquainted with mathematics. He shows, in his great work, the Geographia … , amodern scientific mentality. Can we lightly assume that medieval sailors of thefourteenth century, without any of this knowledge, and without moderninstruments except a rudimentary compass—and without mathematics—could produce amore scientific product? Nordenskiöld felt that there had been in antiquity ageographic tradition superior to the one represented by Ptolemy. He thought thatthe “normal portolano” must have been in use then by sailors and navigators, andhe answered the objection that there was no mention of such maps by the variousclassical writers by pointing out that in the Middle Ages, when the protolancharts were in use, they were never referred to by the Schoolmen, the academicscholars of that age. Both in ancient and in medieval times the academicmapmaker and the practical navigator were apparently poles apart.12Note carefully what Hapgood is really implying here, for if medieval navigatorshad no more than crude mathematical techniques and even cruder navigationalinstruments, then the medieval portolanos, exemplified in the Dulcert portolano,must represent some hidden tradition of secret knowledge, handed down from HighAntiquity and antedating even Ptolemy and the renowned library of Alexandria.However, is there any more evidence to suggest such a notion? Indeed there is,but it is a slightly complicated matter to convey. When Hapgood and his studentsbegan to correlate the latitude and longitude positions of Piri Reis’ map withactual modern calculations of positions, they discovered that Piri Reis’ map wasoff by some 4 1/2 percent. The source of this error in Piri Reis’ map appearedto have stemmed from Eratosthenes’ computation of the circumference of theEarth.13 When Piri Reis’ map was redrawn with this correction, an astoundingthing resulted, one with profound implications: We found that this resulted in reducing all the longitude errorsuntil they nearly vanished. This was a startling development. It could only mean thatthe Greek geographers of Alexandria, when they prepared their world map usingthe circumference of Eratosthenes, had in front of them source maps that hadbeen drawn without the Eratosthenian error, that is, apparently without anydiscernible error at all … suggesting that the people who had originated themaps possessed a more advanced science than that of the Greeks.14In other words, there was a more ancient, and hidden, tradition of knowledgebehind the medieval portolanos, and indeed, behind the map of Admiral Piri Reis.Hapgood summarizes these implications in no uncertain terms: To sum up, then, this part of the Piri Re’is [sic, et passim] Mapsuggests that Piri Re’is had a source map of Africa, Europe, and the Atlanticislands, based on maps probably drawn originally on some sort of trigonometricprojection adjusted to the curvature of the earth. By default of anyalternative, we seem forced to ascribe the origin of this part of the map to apre-Hellenic people—not to Renaissance or Medieval cartographers, and not to theArabs, who were just as badly off as everybody else with respect to longitude,and not to the Greeks either. The trigonometry of the projection (or rather itsinformation on the size of the earth) suggests the work of Alexandriangeographers, but the evident knowledge of longitude implies a people unknown tous, a nation of seafarers, with instruments for finding longitude undreamed ofby the Greeks, and, so far as we know, not possessed by the Phoenicians,either.15Elsewhere, Hapgood is even more deliberate in pointing out the obviousimplications of a lost culture and knowledge from High Antiquity: The picture that seems to emerge, therefore, is one of ascientific achievement far beyond the capacities of the navigators and mapmakersof the Renaissance, of any period of the Middle Ages, of the Arab geographers,or of the known geographers of ancient times. It appears to demonstrate thesurvival of a cartographic tradition that could hardly have come to us exceptthrough some such people as the Phoenicians or the Minoans, the great seapeoples who long preceded the Greeks but passed down to them their maritimelore.16 This method of dividing the circle is not modern; it isthe oldest way of dividing the circle known to man. Furthermore, since itinvolves counting by tens, it alone can explain how the ancient source map ofthe Antarctic, probably drawn ages before either Phoenicians or Babyloniansexisted, had on it the circle that Oronteus Finaeus took for the AntarcticCircle, but which we have shown may have been the 80th parallel. The implicationfrom this is that the 360-degree circle and the twelve-wind system were ancientbefore the rise of Babylonia and long before Tyre and Sidon were built by thePhoenicians. Babylonian science was thus, perhaps, a heritage from a much olderculture.17That is, Piri Reis’ map represents the survival of a hidden, ancient tradition,one stemming—as Hapgood notes—from Alexandria, Egypt. This now brings us at lastto a consideration of the famous voyage that broke the back of the monopoly ofthe northern Italian city-states on the trading routes to the East, andparticularly the Venetian monopoly. It brings us to …B. CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS’ VOYAGES AND THE HIDDEN CARTOGRAPHIC TRADITION[Contents.html#rsec81]It brings us to the implied hidden reasons for it, reasons carefully disguisedbehind the story—most likely a cover story—that Columbus was merely trying tofind a direct oceanic route to trade with the Orient.1. Piri Reis’ Statements on Columbus [Contents.html#rsec82]Significantly, it is the Turkish admiral Piri Reis who, once again, pries openthe door to a significant mystery regarding Columbus and the possiblereal—though very definitely secret—purposes of his initial voyage for Ferdinandand Isabella of Spain. On his now famous map there are marginal notes by theadmiral himself, and in one of these, Piri Reis states: This section explains the way the map was prepared. Such a map isnot owned by anybody at this time. I, personally, drawn (sic) and prepared thismap. In preparing this map, I made use of about twenty old charts and eightMappa Mundis, i.e., of the charts called “Jaferiye” by the Arabs and prepared atthe time of Alexander the Great and in which the whole inhabited world wasshown; of the chart of (the) West Indies; and of the new maps made by fourPortugueses (sic) containing the Indian and Chinese countries geometricallyrepresented on them. I also studied the chart that Christopher Columbus drew forthe West. Putting all these material (sic) together in a common scale I producedthe present map. My map is as correct and dependable for the seven seas as arethe charts that represent the seas of our countries.18Note that Piri Reis states that he is relying upon a chart drawn by Columbus“for the West.” But the questions are, when did Columbus draw this chart,before, or after, his first voyage? And more importantly, what did it show?The standard answer is of course that Columbus drew his chart “for the West”after his return to Europe from his first voyage. However, in yet anothermarginal note the Turkish admiral states something truly astounding. Ponderthese words closely: But it is reported thus, that a Genoese infidel, his name wasColombo, he it was who discovered these places. For instance, a book fell intothe hands of the said Colombo, and he found it said in this book that at the endof the Western Sea (Atlantic) that is, on its western side, there were coastsand islands and all kinds of metals and also precious stones. Theabove-mentioned, having studied this book thoroughly, explained these mattersone by one to the great of Genoa and said: “Come, give me two ships, let me goand find these places.” They said: “O unprofitable man, can an end of a limit befound to the Western Sea? Its vapour is full of darkness.” The above-mentionedColombo saw that no help was forthcoming from the Genoese, he sped forth, wentto the Bey of Spain (king), and told his tale in detail. They too answered theGenoese. In brief Colombo petitioned these people for a long time, finally theBey of Spain gave him two ships, saw that they were well equipped, and said: “O Colombo, if it happens as you say, let us make youkapudan (admiral) to that country.” Having said which he sent the said Colomboto the Western Sea.19Note carefully what we have here, for according to Piri Reis: 1) Columbus possessed a book relating the knowledge of the New World, inother words, Columbus had access to knowledge not generally available, to secretknowledge, and therefore possibly had access to a secret cartographic traditionas well; 2) That knowledge stated that there was an abundance of bullion and gems,in other words, a source of bullion not in the hands of the Orient, nor theVenetians, and thus, a means of breaking the bullion and banking monopolies ofItaly; and finally and most importantly; 3) The publicly-stated purpose for Columbus’ voyage—the version taught tothis day in standard academic histories—namely, that the Genoese navigator wasseeking a direct trade route to the Far East, was not the real purpose of thevoyage; the real purpose from the outset was to find “Atlantis,” the lands ofthe Western Sea, to find the New World, and its riches.We can see why King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella would back such a venture, forif Columbus’ effort to find the New World failed, a direct trade route to theFar East might nonetheless be opened, bypassing the rival Portuguese monopolyroutes around the horn of Africa and through the Indian Ocean. If, on the otherhand, Columbus did discover the New World and thus the potential for vast newsources of spices, bullion, and gems, then again, Ferdinand and Isabella wouldgain. It was, for them, a win-win proposition, but one whose true purpose—thetesting of a tradition of hidden knowledge—had to be maintained in deepestsecrecy lest Spain lose its jump-started position in the race for those riches.Indeed, it was the historian Las Casas who stated that prior to his firstvoyage, Columbus “had a world map, which he showed to King Ferdinand and QueenIsabella, and which, apparently, convinced them that they should backColumbus.”20One can reconstruct a possible sequence of events. Columbus originallyapproached the Spanish monarchs, and shared with them the details from his book.After several attempts to persuade them had failed, he finally produced what hewas holding back in order to convince them: a world map depicting portions ofthe New World. Such a map would have had to be detailed in other particularsknown to the Spanish in order to convince them. Is there any evidence of such amap?Indeed there is.And it exists independently of any speculative reconstructions surroundingColumbus.The map, made by Martin Behaim in 1492 prior to Columbus’ voyage, clearly showsearly depictions of the mouth of the St. Lawrence seaway and portions ofNewfoundland:[images/f0204-01.jpg]Hapgood’s Reproduction of the Modern Cartographic depiction of the St. LawrenceChannel (Upper Left), the map of Sebastion Cabot (1544) in the upper right, theLescarbot Map of 1606 in the Lower Right, and Martin Behaim’s Map of 1492, priorto Columbus’ Return, in the lower left.21In other words, Behaim clearly had access to some cartographic traditiondepicting the New World before Columbus had even returned, raising thepossibility that Columbus had access to such a tradition as well.But if so, where does it come from?At the beginning of this section, we noted that Venice is the most likelypossibility, since it had sacked Constantinople in 1204 during the FourthCrusade, and made off with a number of important treasures, some, no doubt, fromthe imperial archives, which would have likely included some remnants from theancient library of Alexandria. We have also, in other chapters of this book,pointed out that the arrival of the Byzantine humanists at the Council ofFerrara-Florence in the early fifteenth century represents another possiblesource of hidden, Hermetic, and esoteric tradition and lore. Hapgood himself isalive to all this possibility: We have seen that Piri Re’is, in all probability, had ancientmaps at his disposal in Constantinople. It is quite possible that copies ofthese had reached the West long before his day. Greek scholars fleeing from theTurks brought thousands of Greek manuscripts to Italy before the fall ofConstantinople in 1453. Much earlier still, in the year 1204, a Venetian fleet,supposedly intended to carry a crusade to the Holy Land, attacked and capturedConstantinople. For about sixty years afterward Italian merchants had access tomap collections in Constantinople.22We therefore concur with Hapgood’s assessment, an assessment strongly implyingthat Columbus’ original voyage had a covert purpose: It is known that (Columbus) traveled widely in Europe, always onthe lookout for maps. His voyage was not a sudden inspiration; it was a deeplysettled objective, one followed with perseverance for many years, and itrequired, above all, maps.23C. SOME FURTHER SPECULATIONS [Contents.html#rsec83]1. Spain, Genoa, and Venice [Contents.html#rsec84]With this, we are now in a position to begin to reassemble some pieces, and toconstruct a speculative scenario of what might have really been going on behindthe scenes of Columbus’ voyage, and its sponsorship by Ferdinand and Isabella. 1) We assume that at some point, the Italian city-states, and inparticular Venice, gained knowledge of the existence of the New World via Greekmanuscripts and maps taken when that city sacked Constantinople in 1204; 2) Thus, Venice, at least, had knowledge of the New World, and activelysuppressed this knowledge for nearly three centuries. The reason for suchsuppression is abundantly clear, for the New World would represent possible newsources of bullion, ending the virtual Venetian monopoly on internationalbullion trade, and it would also represent an end to the Venetian near-monopolyon trade with the Far East, since Venice, isolated as it was, had no easy accessto the Atlantic Ocean and the trading possibilities it represented. 3) Consequently, one sees two familiar patterns—first appearing inancient times, and continuing into modern times—of a financial elite that is a) actively seeking ancient sources of information, and b) seeking to monopolize and suppress it, lest that knowledge breakout of the closed system of finance that made their power, position, andprestige, possible.Columbus’ discovery of the New World was the game changer for the closed systemof bullion trade and finance that Venice dominated, and it was meant to be.Unlike with Giordano Bruno, however, Genoa could not simply arrange for all ofSpain to be burnt at the stake for opening the system.It is worth pointing out yet another speculative possibility as to how thismonopoly of hidden knowledge was broken. In chapter two [Chapter002.html], andagain earlier in this chapter, I pointed out that one likely source for thesudden explosion of Hermeticism in northern Italy was the Greek humanists whoaccompanied the imperial delegation to the Council of Ferrara-Florence(1438–1439) a mere four decades prior to Columbus’ fateful voyage. It is likelyhere that the Venetian monopoly over hidden cartographic tradition—if indeedthere was one—was broken, and it is significant that a seaman from Genoa, thegreat rival of Venice, should be the one to break it.24Indeed, Genoa could not burn all of Spain at the stake for daring to open up thesystem again, but it is suggestive, and perhaps also significant, that for abrief moment in history, Genoese bankers became the financiers to the Spanishcrown, as if in repayment of a “hidden secret protocol” in the negotiationsbetween Ferdinand, Isabella, and Christopher Columbus. After all, it was theGenoan adventurer that they named Admiral of the Atlantic upon his return toSpain, and it was the bankers of Genoa who for that brief moment in history madeprofit from Spain’s new sources of bullion.Nor can we assume for a moment that the revisionist explanation that Columbuswas after a new source of slaves somehow evades the implications of thespeculations entertained in this chapter, for slavery, as we know by now all toowell, was an integral component of the bullion-coinage-military-slavery complex.________________________1 Oscar Wilde, “The Critic as Artist.”2 Charles H.

For the financial oligarchies, thisconnection was, as I have argued, most likely perceived as a threat to one ofthe pillars of social manipulation and power they had long associated themselveswith: religion.Indeed, at a deeper historical level, we discovered that coinage and the bullionfrom which it is confected can be viewed as a very close analogue of theMetaphor itself, and suggestively, while the doctrine of corporate personhoodarose from certain theological foundations—in our opinion historically suspectand doctrinally erroneous ones—it is also possible to see in the activities ofmedieval Venetian and Florentine merchants and bankers the growing awarenessthat the doctrine, allied to the alchemical analogy of money as the Metaphor,could function as a basis for the concentration and accumulation of vast wealthand power in a few hands. Indeed, after the collapse of the Bardi and Peruzzi,we see the Medicis repeating, on a far less grand scale, the same operationalstrategies and tactics with a new twist: the central office became, in itself, akind of holding company, directing the branches of its far flung concerns, eachin themselves yet another corporation, thus providing another layer ofinsulation between the partners’ personal liabilities and that of thecorporation itself.But most importantly, what does clearly emerge from a rudimentary considerationof the strange “coincidences” surrounding the collapse of the Florentinesuper-companies is that the collapse, while initiated and brought on, perhaps,by factors wholly outside of any human manipulation, the possibility ofdeliberate Venetian exploitation of the crisis is at least possible, and to alesser extent probable. In short, a case can be made that the “internetconspiracy theories” regarding the Venetian oligarchy—and, in some versions, theoligarchies of the other great northern Italian city-states—were indeedmanipulating market forces on a global scale, and at least European politics ona continental one.One thing, however, is abundantly clear, and that is that regardless of whereone turns, or from which point of view one examines Venetian practices andinstitutions, whether one approaches analysis from the standpoint of domesticpolitics and government institutions, or from the standpoint of banking, orbullion brokering, or even geopolitics, the Venetian oligarchy did actconsistently, as a class, to cloak any factional divisions within its ranks, andconspired always to protect their own interests, and to make entry into theirranks difficult. The very fact that the nobility itself was distinguishedbetween longhi and curti, between ancient and more recent houses, stronglysuggests that the longhi nobility were acutely aware of ancient roots andconnections.It is beyond any question that those oligarchies began to develop theirsophisticated “playbook” during the Middle Ages. The Bardi and Peruzzisuper-companies, just like the modern International Monetary Fund, World Bank,and other such institutions, established the mercantilist pattern of makingsignificant loans to governments, and exacting as a “conditionality” of theirloans dedicated liens on government revenues, and eventually, even the power tooversee the tax collection that repaid these loans, gathering more and more ofthe powers of the state into their own hands, until, of course, overcome withevents and a gold glut that shows every indication of having been engineered byVenetian hands, they were caught in a cash flow crisis from which they could notescape, and they collapsed.As for Venice, the oligarchical playbook developed forms and methods that wouldmake a member of the modern military-industrial complex proud, for rather thanpublicly amend the structure and constitution of their government, Venetianssimply created new “emergency” agencies to deal with problems as they arose. Themost famous, of course, was the Council of Ten, a body whose true importance canonly be appreciated if one notes that the intelligence it gathered (on a trulyglobal basis) provided information on future market conditions and trends,allowing Venetian merchants and banks to prosper, or at minimum to manage theirlosses. Such widespread global intelligence also raises the possibility thatVenice was able to confirm the existence of the New World through Oriental, aswell as archived Byzantine, sources. Academics may choose to dismiss the arrivalof a massive gold shipment in Venice in the same year as the Peruzzi collapse as“coincidental.” But such shipments would have had to have been in long planningand preparation, and Venetian agents would have known of the difficulties of thecompany—after all, it maintained a branch in Venice, and leased Venetian shipsto transport its commodities.Within Venice, too, another technique and tactic arose, the manipulation of“seigniorage” of the mint, itself firmly in the hands of the oligarchicalfamilies. This was, so to speak, the same thing as a modern central bank such asthe Federal Reserve or Bank of England manipulating the prime lending rate. Andas we have also seen, Venice was not above using outright currencymanipulation—witness the famous Blind Doge Enrico Dandolo’s coinage of a nearreplica of the Byzantine hyperperon, in an effort to drive the Roman coinage outand replace it with the Venetian one in Middle Eastern trade. The FourthCrusade, seen in this light, was a continuation by other means of the economicwarfare that this step announced.Finally, we have argued a purely speculative case that in the wake of the FourthCrusade, Venice may indeed have come into possession of ancient maps thatclearly suggested a “New World,” and hence an opening of the system of tradethat would have endangered Venice’s unique and dominant position in East-Westtrade. Given its geographical, and geopolitical, position, Venice would havesuppressed that knowledge, yet another key ingredient of the oligarchicalplaybook: when knowledge is discovered that for whatever reason can threaten thepower of the ruling oligarchy, that knowledge should be suppressed, until thatruling elite has positioned itself to take advantage of it (if possible).In the aftermath of the War of the League of Cambrai, some researchers, such asWebster Tarpley, have argued that the Venetian oligarchy clearly saw thehandwriting on the wall: their power could no longer be sustained using Veniceas a base of operations. Seeing this, they simply decided to move …________________________1 Graeber, David.

Indeed Amsterdam bore an uncanny physicalresemblance to Venice, with the same water everywhere, dividing the city up intoislands, islets and canals, surrounding it on all sides with marshes; Amsterdamhad her vaterschepen, the little boats which ferried in fresh water, just as theboats on the Brenta did for Venice. Both cities were after all ringed round withsalt water.”—Fernand Braudel1VENICE WAS FAMOUS, or better put, infamous, for its sudden, short, sharpapplications of military force to bring errant colonies and bases to heel, andin the enforcement of its policies. It is, not surprisingly, a technique thatbecame yet another component of the oligarchical playbook, for we see it inevidence again in the Dutch trading empire, based in Amsterdam, with itsships-of-the-line and grenadiers enforcing its will. The pattern is of courseeven more in evidence with the British Empire, and updated with the latesttechnological gadgets—in this case, pilotless drones and stealth bombers—for theAmerican Empire.In this, one could certainly argue that there was at least a continuity ofmethod from one mercantilist empire to the next. But the real question thatneeds to be answered, even if only in the cursory form of “suggestiveindications,” is the question implied by researcher Webster Griffin Tarpley inthe epigraph that began this section: A badly mauled, indebted and humiliated Venice survived the Warof the League of Cambrai … At the deepest level, some patricians realized thatthe lagoon city could now be crushed like an egg-shell, and was not a suitablebase for world domination. As after 1200 there had been talk of moving thecapital, perhaps to Constantinople, so now plans began to hatch that wouldfacilitate a metastasis of the Venetian cancer towards the Atlantic world.2The fact that the Dutch city of Amsterdam was founded in a similar swamp, andthat so many of its cultural institutions seem so peculiarly similar to Veniceitself, only adds fuel to the fire for some theorists.The question implied by such views is this: is there any connection betweenthese mercantilist empires beyond mere resemblance of method? Are there anyindicators of actual personal, or familial, overlap from the oligarchy of one tothe next? Can one indeed maintain at least a prima facie case that the rise ofthe mercantilist empires was not merely the accident of the discovery of the NewWorld and the resulting inevitable eclipse of the northern Italian city-states,and that, at least in part, some of these families simply picked up and movedshop, so to speak?There are, indeed, indicators that this is the case, and again, they are openlyhidden in the history of the period. Let us take one example.Venice, as noted in previous chapters, dominated the world bullion trade and wasindeed the European center of a global bullion exchange market. And as alsopreviously noted, Venice managed to acquire the dominant position in theEuropean production of silver via its close association with the German familiesmining this commodity. The economic historian Fernand Braudel, whom we justcited, observed that Venice required German commodities traders to come directlyto Venice to buy and sell, bringing with them, of course, the silver with whichthey did so. At the same time, Venice prohibited her own merchants from buyingand selling directly in Germany.3 “That this was conscious policy on Venice’spart,” Braudel observes, “can hardly be doubted, since she forced it upon allthe cities more or less dependent upon her.” All trade was obliged to passthrough Venice, and consequently, “Venice had quite deliberately ensnared allthe surrounding subject economies, including the German economy, for her ownprofit: she drew her living from them, preventing them from acting freely andaccording to their own lights.”4The agents of Venice in this enterprise were yet another famous Renaissancebanking and merchant family dynasty, the German family of the Fuggers, who, likethe Medici, learned their trade quite literally by being schooled in Venice’smarkets.5 The mercantilist arrangements thus connected the Venetian oligarchs,whose power depended so closely upon their ability to control and manipulate thegold-to-silver bullion ratio so vital to their East-West trade, to the northernand central European economy quite directly. Thus, in this context, Tarpley’sobservations begin to make sense, for any Venetian oligarchical consideration ofthe deliberate transference of their base of operations would bear thisconsideration in mind. Equally, they would have to consider the geopoliticalrealities: the key to future survival, and expansion of their wealth and power,would require a base of operations with direct access to the Atlantic ocean, andthis narrowed the possibilities considerably, since Spain and Portugal werealready well-established Atlantic trading powers, as was France. This left tworelatively less powerful areas open for consideration: the Netherlands andEngland. So from the standpoint of geopolitical and economic calculation, onceagain, Tarpley’s observations make a great deal of sense. If the oligarchy movedat all, it would have to move north, and west, or perish altogether.So what sorts of things would one look for to confirm that indeed there was adeliberate policy of such transference occurring?There are two things: one rather obvious, and the other, not so obvious. Let usbegin with the not so obvious one, since the obvious one, once known, is ratherstunning.As we have discovered through the previous chapters, the Most Serene Republic ofVenice was indeed an oligarchy, that is to say, the institutions of publicgovernment, and private enterprise, were all firmly in the hands of the Venetiannobility, to such an extent that, like the Grain Office, the boundaries betweenpublic and private institutions and agencies begins to blur. After thedissolution of the Grain Office, the private banks of the Rialto began to issueand hold the public debt of the Venetian government directly. To use a modernanalogy, there was no one private central bank, there were several, and each, ofcourse, was directly tied to some family or faction within the Venetianoligarchy. Mueller notes that ca. 1470–1500, the size of the Republic’sindebtedness to these banks was probably somewhere around five million ducats,6an astronomical figure for that day, even for governments with much largerterritories, much less for one city-state.Consequently, if there was to be such a transference by any portion of thatoligarchy northward, any holdings of public debt of the Venetian state wouldhave to be sold and converted to liquid capital, and the family fortunetransferred northward. This is, at least in some cases, exactly what happened.Tarpley observes that Under the impact of the War of the League of Cambrai, theVenetian oligarchy realized the futility of attempting a policy of worlddomination from the tiny base of a city-state among the lagoons of the northernAdriatic.In other words, Tarpley is expressing the geopolitical reasoning we haveoutlined in more detail above. He continues: As was first suggested by the present writer in 1981, theVenetian oligarchy (especially its “giovani” faction around Paolo Sarpi)responded by transferring its family fortunes (fondi), philosophical outlook,and political methods into such states as England, France, and the Netherlands.Soon the Venetians had decided that England (and Scotland) was the most suitablesite for the New Venice, the future center of a new, world-wide Roman Empirebased on maritime supremacy.7This represents, for Tarpley, and as we have also suggested in the previouspages, a continuation of a very ancient practice: The oligarchical system of Great Britain is not an autochthonousproduct of English or British history. It represents rather the tradition of theBabylonians, Romans, Byzantines, and Venetians which has been transplanted intothe British Isles through a series of upheavals. The status of Britain as thenation foutué of modern history is due in particular to the sixteenth andseventeenth century metastasis into England and Scotland of the Venetianoligarchy along with its philosophy, political forms, family fortunes, andimperial geopolitics.8However, this transference did not occur directly, but via a “middle” step orstopover in Amsterdam.9Note Tarpley’s statement that there is a direct family connection, via theirfamily “fund,” in this transference. After liquidating the public debt, whichcould easily be done through inflation via the mint, which the nobilitycontrolled, important questions arise:Who are some of the families involved in this operation, and are there realindicators of a transfer northward?Indeed there are. Let us take just one example, perhaps paradoxically the onemost well-known, and yet paradoxically least well-known for its Italian andVenetian connection.Earlier in this book I noted that one of the d’Este family—a famous Italiannoble house and definitely a member of “the oligarchy”—had significant deposits,and hence influence, in the Venetian grain office. This family subsequentlysplit into two branches, with the older branch known as the Welf-Este, orsimply, the House of Welf, from the Germanized version of the Italian Guelph.10The name Welf-Este was the family name of the Dukes of Bavaria. This family’syounger branch produced influential rulers of the city-state of Ferrara innorthern Italy, and by 1405, when the whole region fell to Venice, the housebecame a virtual Venetian satrapy. The origins of the house date to the earlyninth century, as far as can be traced, when its first member establishedhimself at Este near Padua.11 These two branches of the family were reunited,and eventually produced the Electors, and later, the Kings, of Hanover, who, ofcourse, produced the Hanoverian monarchs of Great Britain.Yet another famous house with Venetian oligarchical roots is the well-known, andvery wealthy, German noble family of Von Thurn-und-Taxis. As Tarpley notes, thisfamily’s roots stem from Venetian territory, where the Thurn-Valsassina familywas known as the della Torre e Tassos.12Intermarriage was, of course, one of the standard techniques of the nobilitythroughout the ages utilized to cement alliances and maintain power. Thus, in acertain sense, it is to be expected that networks of familial relationships canbe traced between the Italian nobility of the city-states in general, and ofVenice in particular, to northern Europe, to the Hanoverian House, the House ofOrange-Nassau in the Netherlands, and of both to Great Britain. But with allsuch marriages, there is always a movement of money, and power. Here, we haveonly sketched the threadbare outlines of a vast and complex story that began inthe swampy lagoon of Venice, and perhaps much longer ago than that, and ended inthe secretive halls and chambers of the Bank of England. Epilogue …… is prologue.As for Venice, with her persecution of Bruno, with his possible role as aVenetian agent until he disclosed to Mocenigo his intentions to found a secretsociety, with her vast wealth in bullion and from the slave trade, and with thedeep currents of the Metaphor running beneath the surface throughout, it isperhaps worth closing with an observation from Roger Crowley. In the year 1500,the Venetian artist Jacopo de’ Barbari produced an enormous woodcut of the cityof Venice, almost three meters long, portraying the city from almost a thousandfeet in the air, and doing so with extraordinary accuracy.13In the midst of it all, at the top of the woodcut map, Venice’s titular god,Mercury, the God of Trade and Commerce, presides over it all. In the lagoonitself, Neptune, or Poseidon, is prominent, his trident raised to the heavens.14Mercury, and Neptune. Apollo, and Poseidon, the God of Atlantis. Mercury, theelement of alchemical transformation, Mercury, god of trade and commerce, likethe Egyptian Hermes.For those willing to read the hermetic symbolism writ large in de’ Barbari’swoodcut, the message is subtle, and clear: Atlantis, ancient high knowledge,trade, commerce, and a deeply rooted Metaphor turned into money, with all itsassociations to the temple of religion, debt, and oligarchical power …Small wonder that Bruno, as least as far as Venice was concerned, had to die.________________________1 Fernand Braudel, Civilization and Capitalism: 15th–18th Century: VolumeIII: The Perspective of the World, trans from the French by Siân Reynolds(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992), p. 182.2 Tarpley, “The Role of the Venetian Oligarchy in Reformation,Counter-Reformation, Enlightenment, and the Thirty Years’ War,” AgainstOligarchy,http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/the-venetian-conspiracy[http://http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/the-venetian-conspiracy].pp. 2–3.3 Braudel, Perspective of the World, p. 125.4 Ibid., p. 125.5 Mueller, Reinhold C.

Let the clergy march under your banner in the belief always thatthey march under the banner of the Apostolic Keys.”—Piccolo Tigre, Permanent Instruction of the Alta Vendita Lodges1IN THE FIRST CHAPTER, I noted that the documentation surrounding GiordanoBruno’s trial and execution remains obscure. And this is for two reasons. Here,it is best, once again, to turn to Frances A. Yates, who provides the intriguingdetails: The documents of the Venetian Inquisition on Bruno’s case havelong been known, also some Roman documents, and are available in VincenzoSpampanato’s publication, Documenti della vita de Giordano Bruno (1933). In1942, a large addition to the evidence was made by Cardinal Angelo Mercati whopublished in that year Il Sommario del Processo di Giordano Bruno. ThisSommario, a summary of the evidence drawn up for the use of the RomanInquisitors, was discovered by Mercati among the personal papers of Pope PiusIX. This document repeats much that was known from the Venetian archives butadds a great deal of new information. It is not, however, the actual processo,the official report on the case giving the sentence, that is to say stating onwhat grounds Bruno was finally condemned. This processo is lost for ever, havingbeen part of a mass of archives which were transported to Paris by the order ofNapoleon, where they were eventually sold as pulp to a cardboard factory.2Why would Napoleon Bonaparte have Venetian archives, which included the originalprocesso of Bruno’s Venetian trial, transported to Paris? And more importantly,why would Pope Pius IX (Giovanni Cardinal Mastai-Ferretti), the pope behind theFirst Vatican Council’s decree of papal infallibility, and of papal immediateand supreme jurisdiction, be in the possession of papers relating to Bruno’strial and execution, and found among his personal documents? To my knowledge, noone has attempted an answer to these questions.And perhaps an answer has not been attempted for good reason, for any attempt todo so will run into some little known, and very murky, facts, which can butcompel speculation toward massive conspiracy.A. BONAPARTE AND THE MASONS [Contents.html#rsec85]We may easily deal with Bonaparte by pointing out that his foreign minister,Bishop Maurice de Talleyrand, was also the foreign minister for the restoredBourbon monarchy after Napoleon’s final downfall, and was a Mason. It may bepossible, therefore, that Bonaparte’s sacking of the Venetian archives may havehad something directly to do with acquisition of the transcripts of Bruno’sInquisition trial.There is, indeed, some evidence for this, for Napoleon was not only a Mason, but“he owed his first elevation to the Jacobins, and that his earliest patron wasRobespierre,” a man with strong lodge connections himself.3 Additionally, thecampaign in Italy that led to his looting of the Venetian archives was acampaign that reflected particular brutality to Catholic establishments.4But it is really after his rule commences as Emperor of the French thatNapoleon’s close ties with Grand Orient Freemasonry become explicit. AlexanderDumas, in his Memoires de Garibaldi, outlines the close association: Napoleon took Masonry under his protection. Joseph Napoleon5 wasGrand Master of the Order. Joachim Murat second Master Adjoint. The EmpressJosephine being at Strasbourg, in 1805, presided over the fete for the adoptionof the Lodge of the True Chevaliers of Paris. At the same time Eugene deBeauharnais was Venerable of the lodge of St. Eugene in Paris … 6And of course it was due in no small part to the machinations of the formerCatholic Bishop de Talleyrand, himself a Mason, that Napoleon obtained power inthe first place. It is therefore possible that Napoleon’s plundering of theVenetian archives, and the removal of documents pertaining to Bruno’s trial,might have had some connection to the behind-the-scenes maneuverings of FrenchMasonry.When we turn to the matter of Pope Pius IX, however, the matter is much moremurky, and we must deal with it in detail.B. GIOVANNI CARDINAL MASTAI-FERRETTI (POPE PIUS IX) [Contents.html#rsec86]1. Brief Notes [Contents.html#rsec87]Giovanni-Maria Mastai Ferretti was born on May 13, 1792, died February 7, 1878,and reigned as Pope Pius IX from 1846 to his death, the longest reigning Pope inCatholic Church history. He is famous, of course, for being the Pope who pushedfor the definition of papal infallibility, and universal, supreme, and immediatejurisdiction of the pope, at the First Vatican Council (1869–1870), oversignificant opposition from German and Austrian bishops. He also presided overthe dissolution of the Papal States under the advance of Italian nationalistarmies, which finally destroyed the last remnants of secular papal power in1870. Pius IX also had the distinction of being the first pope to allow himselfto be photographed.[images/f0226-01.jpg]Pope Pius IX (Giovanni-Maria Cardinal Mastai-Ferretti)It is noteworthy that Pius IX was elected by the liberalizing wing of theCardinalate, in response to the liberal and revolutionary attitudes sweepingEurope in the mid-1840s, though after a series of assassinations of hisministers, Pius turned increasingly conservative and reactionary, a moveculminating in the dogmas of the First Vatican Council. For our purposes,however, we note Pius IX’s early liberal attitudes, for these, in turn, wouldhave been a motivation for him to join the many secret societies of Europechampioning such causes. Indeed, in the early years of his papacy Pius IXdisplayed remarkable leniency to revolutionary political prisoners and to theItalian revolutionary secret society, the Carbonari.We therefore turn to a consideration of statements of the Carbonari leaderPiccolo Tigre, “The Permanent Instruction of the Alta Vendita,” made in 1849,three years after the election of Mastai-Ferretti to the papacy.2. The Permanent Instruction of the Alta Vendita Lodge [Contents.html#rsec88]By the 1840s, Weishaupt’s Illuminati had been replaced by the Italian Carbonarilodges as the most obviously revolutionary lodges of Europe, and theirmanifesto, “The Permanent Instruction of the Alta Vendita,” is a distilledessence of Weishaupt’s Illuminism. For our purposes, we need only cite thosepassages dealing with their plans for the Catholic Church: Our final end is that of Voltaire and of the French Revolution,the destruction for ever (sic) of Catholicism and even of the Christian ideawhich, if left standing on the ruins of Rome, would be the resuscitation ofChristianity later on … … The remedy is found. The Pope, whoever he may be, willnever come to the secret societies. It is for the secret societies to come firstto the Church, in the resolve to conquer the two. … We do not mean to win the Popes to our cause, to make themneophytes of our principles, and propagators of our ideas. That would be aridiculous dream, no matter in what manner events may turn. Should cardinals orprelates, for example, enter, willingly or by surprise, into a part of oursecrets, it would be by no means a motive to desire their elevation to the Seeof Peter. That elevation would destroy us. Ambition alone would bring them toapostasy from us. The needs of power would force them to immolate us. That whichwe ought to demand, that which we should seek and expect, as the Hews expectedthe Messiah, is a Pope according to our wants.7The document goes on to outline a plan—reminiscent of Weishaupt’s Illuminati—toco-opt the seminaries of the church, and thus to allow our doctrines to pass to the bosoms of the young clergy, and goeven to the depths of convents. In a few years the young clergy will have, bythe force of events, invaded all functions. They will govern, administer, andjudge. They will form the council of the Sovereign. They will be called upon tochoose the Pontiff who will reign; and that Pontiff, like the greater part ofhis contemporaries, will be necessarily imbued with the Italian and humanitarianprinciples which we are about to put in circulation.8It is indeed interesting to observe that Mastai-Ferretti, with his early liberalviews and attitudes toward the Carbonari, would seem to fit this bill perfectly.One might go so far as to speculate that there would be no better way to gainpower in the Roman church through such a process of subterfuge than to have itsprimary institution—the papacy—proclaimed infallible, and to endow it with auniversal, supreme, and immediate jurisdiction.While this may sound absurd, there is more …3. José Maria Cardinal Caro y Rodriguez, Cardinal Archbishop of Santiago[Contents.html#rsec89]In a little-known work, The Mystery of Freemasonry Unveiled (1928), José MariaCardinal Caro y Rodriguez, then Archbishop of Santiago de Chile, made somerather breathtaking observations about the pope of papal infallibility: For the present I shall tell only of the origin of the imputationmade against Pius IX, which is the one the Masons tell most often and withgreatest assurance. Here is the way John Gilmary Shea tells and refutes thatfable in his Life of Pius IX, pp. 291–292, (written in English). “It began inGermany and the Masons believed that by laying the scene in America, it mighthelp to escape investigation. They declared positively that Pius IX had beenreceived into a certain Masonic lodge in Philadelphia, they quoted theirdiscourses and declared that several of his autographs were kept in this lodge.Unfortunately for the story, Philadelphia is in the civilized world. The peoplethere know how to read and write. The claim was investigated and it was foundthat in that city, there is no Masonic lodge of the name given. It was alsofound that no lodges in Philadelphia had ever received a Juan Maria Mastai; notrace could be found that he had ever been there, because he never had been; nolodge had any of his autographed letters; the masons themselves testified thatthe entire matter was merely an invention. The calumny this refuted has beenrevived from time to time, and in the last version care was taken not to specifythe lodge or the city.” (Arthur Press, A Study in American Freemasonry,270–271). To make it more credible they have placed on the photograph of a Masonwith insignias, the head of the Pope, cut from his portrait and substituted inplace of the Mason’s. The reader will recall the previously cited advice ofWeishaupt to be sure that persons of merit belong to Masonry, thereby helping toacquire new members. That lie involving Pius IX was calculated above all todeceive the clergy so that they might follow the example of one who had beentheir chief. I do not know if there could be found in the world a priest sonaive that he would allow himself to be deceived by it.9Note what we have: 1) The story about Pius IX’s Masonic initiation and membership began tobe circulated in Germany; 2) Pius IX was allegedly initiated in a lodge in “Philadelphia;” 3) When lodges in Philadelphia were consulted, no indication of any suchinitiation or membership was forthcoming, nor was Mastai-Ferretti ever known tohave traveled to America; thus, 4) Cardinal Caro y Rodriguez concludes that the story was just that, astory, circulated to deceive other Roman Catholic clergy into accepting Masonicinitiation (and also, one may speculate, to confuse or cast doubts among theclergy about the orthodoxy of its own hierarchy and institution).There is, however, more than just this one problem.4. A Sidelight from the Bavarian Illuminati [Contents.html#rsec90]It is known that Mastai-Ferretti did travel to South America in 1823 and 1825.More importantly, however, is that at least one secret society with close tiesto Freemasonry was known to employ “code names” not only for its members, butalso for their locations. This was the Bavarian Illuminati of Ingolstadtprofessor of canon law, Adam Weishaupt (1748–1830).For example, Weishaupt himself took the name “Spartacus” as his code name, andhis close associate Baron Knigge took the code name “Cato.” More importantly,however, are the names assigned to provinces and towns. Bavaria, for example,was code-named Achaia, the Tyrol region of northern Italy, the Peloponnese.Similarly, Munich was code-named Athens, Ravensburg was code-named Sparta,Vienna became Rome, and so on, for purposes of coded communications between thesociety’s initiates.10 The implication is clear, for if other fraternal ordersmaintained this Illuminist practice, the slim possibility arises thatMastai-Ferretti may have been initiated into a lodge in a “Philadelphia” thatwas simply a code-name for a European city.5. Fr. Malachi Martin on “The Bargain” [Contents.html#rsec91]In his novel Vatican, Fr. Malachi Martin outlines the features of what he called“the Bargain,” a secret agreement negotiated by the Vatican after the loss ofthe Papal States during Italian unification with the high Masonic powers ofEurope, in order to gain access to the financial and banking houses of the Westand thereby increase its own financial power. As a component of this Bargain,those powers in return received the right of a secret veto of any candidateelected to the papacy. Later, in his last book, the novel Windswept House,Martin wrote of a church hollowed out from within by members of various secretsocieties with obvious Masonic overtones. This matched in fiction with what someRoman Catholic writers were stating in non-fiction works in the wake of thenotorious P2-G scandal, in which Licio Gelli’s Masonic Propaganda Due lodge hadsuccessfully infiltrated various Vatican institutions, including, according tosome, its financial institutions.All of this would tend, in a very broad fashion, to corroborate the speculationadvanced above, that perhaps the association between the Vatican and thefraternal orders of Europe began with Giovanni Cardinal Mastai-Ferretti himself,who, as Pope Pius IX, led the effort to have the Pope proclaimed infallible, andpossessed of an universal, supreme, and immediate jurisdiction over and abovethe Church. It would, in some measure, explain Mastai-Ferretti’s interest in thecase of Giordano Bruno from a different perspective; instead of justecclesiastical interest, it was the interest of one initiate in another.Of course, all of this is highly speculative, and we simply present it forconsideration here. It remains my own personal opinion that it is unlikely thatMastai-Ferretti was a member of any secret society, but only slightly possiblethat he was such a member. Nonetheless, if he was, the timing of his pontificateand his early liberal attitudes square quite nicely with the attitude outlinedin the Permanent Instruction, and if he was an initiate, it would put a uniqueperspective on his fascination with Giordano Bruno. It would be as if Bruno’sGiordanistas had come home to capture the papacy itself.On the other hand, however, Mastai-Ferretti’s subsequent conservatism andultramontanism would also explain the fascination, as being the interest ofsomeone concerned about the power of the very secret societies that sogalvanized the Italian revolution and unification, and stripped him of the lastvestiges of power by providing a final end to the Papal States. That too wouldhave been a final manifestation of the Giordanistas sweeping Italy, to the verygates of the Apostolic Palace.________________________1 Piccolo Tigre, Permanent Instruction of the Alta Vendita, in MonsignorGeorge E.
