INITIAL PERSONAL NOTES I am not a ufologist, nor did I ever intend to address that topic directly inany of my books. And, in a certain sense, I am not addressing that subject inthis one. What I am addressing is one particular aspect within it, an aspectthat has assumed almost mythical status within the ufology community, andrightly so, for thanks to the tireless efforts and research of many others whoare unapologetic ufologists, the government’s various explanations for theevents at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, have all but dissolved, except for thefirst one, namely, that the United States Army Air Force, in July of 1947, hadrecovered the debris of a crashed “flying saucer” in the sands of the NewMexican desert.Nevertheless, I came to write this book reluctantly, for on the one hand, likeso many within the ufology community, I (an outsider to that community) cannothelp but be persuaded that something truly extraordinary happened in New Mexicoin that hot July of 1947, something so extraordinary that it sent shockwavesthroughout the U.S. military and government. But on the other hand, I alsocannot help but be persuaded, like so many within the “Roswell skeptics’community,” that the Roswell-ET mythology is deeply flawed, that there is somedeeply rooted, almost visceral problem with the whole “standard extraterrestrialexplanation” of the event. I thus stand in an unenviable no-man’s-land asregards the Roswell story, for on the one hand, I agree with the classic Roswellresearchers - Stanton Friedman, Dr. Kevin Randle, Charles Berlitz, William Mooreand others - that something had to have happened in New Mexico to call forthsuch extraordinary efforts on the part of the government to recover it, and thento orchestrate no less than four different versions of what had happened(depending on how one counts the various versions). I remain unconvinced of theskeptics’ attempts to trivialize it into merely mundane, ordinary, and almostcomical explanations.On the other hand, however, the whole Roswell mythology with its weedyovergrowth of dead aliens, secret autopsies, leaked documents, and eyewitnessesspeaking out on their deathbeds (or after!), leaves me sharing the intuitions ofthe skeptics, that there is something deeply wrong with the ever-evolving storyand its seemingly endless parade of witnesses coming forward at the last minuteto reveal what they saw, or – in that unique blend of second-hand testimony withdead man’s testimony that counts as evidence in ufology - what others told themthey saw. As we shall see, the majority of the Roswell legend that involves theallegation of the recovery of extraterrestrial life forms or their cadaversinvolves precisely this type of testimony, and as such, the skeptics are rightto complain of it. But on the other hand, why would such secondhand witnessesfeel compelled to confabulate such a story? They have almost everything to loseby doing so, and almost nothing to gain. And why would the military go to suchlengths to threaten such people into silence, which – if one is to believe thesewitnesses – it very much did, if there were not some element of theextraordinary that was actually involved in the event? And even if these talesof threats and intimidation are questionable – for according to some they are –why would the military concoct two wildly divergent explanations, the “recoveredflying saucer” and the “weather balloon” explanations, all on the same day andwithin mere hours of each other?Being thus caught somewhere in the no-man’s-land between these two camps, I amquite certain that this book will bring little joy and even less consolation toeither – if either camp pays attention to it at all - for in it, I maintain thatsomething truly exotic, extraordinary, and definitely not American did crash inNew Mexico in July of 1947, and that a massive cover-up ensued because of it,but I likewise maintain that what crashed was wholly terrestrial; noextraterrestrials, no “cosmic Watergate,” no alien autopsies.By referring to my position as occupying an unenviable no-man’s-land, I mean toexhibit the methodological approach adopted in this book, for both sides in the“Roswell War” are stubbornly dug into well-entrenched and fortified positions.Thus, to advance any scenario such as I am proposing here is also to propose akind of set-piece positional battle, requiring a painstaking reconnoitering ofthe opposing lines, a careful “softening up” campaign and, only at the end, acarefully planned and orchestrated attack. There are no metaphorical panzers,dive-bombers, heavy artillery or blitzkriegs here. There is only infantry,artillery, and the monotonous slog through the oft-bombarded Roswell mud. In theend, all combatants may just get sick of it all, agree to an armistice, andretire from the field in sheer stalemated exhaustion.If there is a “cosmic Watergate” with respect to Roswell – and I believe theremost definitely is – it is for very different reasons than the extraterrestrialone, for I will argue in this book that what crashed in New Mexico was not onlyan exotic, but a wholly terrestrial technology, and that it was also Nazi. Andby saying it was Nazi, I do not mean that it was some black project beingconducted by postwar Paperclip Nazis in conjunction with the American military.I mean by Nazi that it was the crash and recovery of something not under thepostwar control of any of the victorious Allied powers that had defeated theThird Reich. I mean therefore that what crashed represented a postwarcontinuation of some of the black projects of the Third Reich, and that thesewere being conducted and deployed by an independent, postwar “NaziInternational,” a kind of extra-territorial Nazi “state.”And that, of course, is a “whopper” of a statement to make.B. THE HUGE ANOMALY That “whopper” precisely illuminates the huge spectrum of perceptions with whichanyone occupying this uncomfortable no-man’s-land must contend, for soentrenched is the “extraterrestrial crash-and-recovery” explanation in the widerculture, that few people stop to consider that it is that explanation that isthe real whopper. To the post-Roswell ufology community, the scenario of“extraterrestrial crash-and-craft-recovery” has become a paradigm by which tointerpret almost every exotic advance of human terrestrial technology, and thepolitical and policy decisions that in some cases result from them. By invokingthis paradigm with the repetition of a religious litany, the crash-retrieval andreverse engineering scenario has gained almost the status of a dogma, which toquestion in certain cases, and especially in this case, becomes a heresy. Forthese types of ufologists – and there are far too many of them – thecrash-retrieval and reverse engineering scenario is the “rational” and“simplest” explanation, making the best sense in the wider historical context ofall the evidence, and fulfilling all the requirements of Ockham’s razor, whichis, crudely stated, that “the simplest explanation fitting all the known factsis the best”. To that community, and the wider cultural perceptions of the eventthat it has created, it is thus any terrestrially based scenario that is wildand fantastic and irrational! Indeed, as will be seen in the main text, cleverword-smithing on the part of some proponents of the extraterrestrial hypothesisof the Roswell Incident attempts a subtle play on the word “mundane,” whichmeans both “of this world,” and “ordinary.” By thus qualifying the RoswellIncident, they subtly implant the idea that any terrestrial explanation can onlybe “mundane” in the second sense, i.e., ordinary. But there is, of course, nonecessary logical argument that leads from “terrestrial” to “ordinary,” just asthere is no necessary logical argument that leads from “the extraordinary” to“the extraterrestrial.”For stop and consider, to assert that something Nazi crashed in New Mexico ismerely to assert that something terrestrial, but not American, crashed, and tosay that it was Nazi is to say that it was extraordinary, not only by dint ofthe extraordinary properties attributed to the wreckage, but also by dint of itsorigin and of its crash at that time and in that place. That means that one doesnot have to explain how a comparatively small craft, such as is alleged for theRoswell craft, crossed the vastness of interstellar space, with all thepresumably advanced and sophisticated extraterrestrial technology that made itpossible, only to crash in New Mexico because it had presumably been damaged bya lightning strike in a thunderstorm, or equally improbably, had collided with asister craft or something else, causing its demise. Surely “ET” would haveadvanced enough technologies to avoid lightning strikes or collisions with otherobjects in the sky.Thus, all one really need explain is a simple set of questions:> 1) Why, if the crash was that of a terrestrially based technology should it> necessarily be Nazi, and not Soviet, or American?> 2) Did the Nazis have technologies that can explain the alleged details of the> debris? If so, what scientific principles might be speculatively reconstructed> from the evidence as the ufology community itself presents it?> 3) If it was Nazi, what on earth were they doing flying around New Mexico two> years after their supposed defeat?> 4) Can this scenario make sense of all the weedy overgrowth of the Roswell> story, i.e., can it make sense of> a) the alleged recovered technology?> b) the alleged recovered alien or extraterrestrial bodies?> c) the military’s panicked and confused reaction to the event and the alleged> creation of the so-called top secret UFO study group (Majic-12, or whatever> one wishes to call it)?> d) the MJ-12 documents hoax?> e) the never ending stream of witness, deathbed confessions, and second-hand> testimony in support of the extraterrestrial scenario?> f) the government’s ever-shifting stories of what “really happened”? This last point requires us to pause and draw attention to a curiouscircumstance, one that only serves to highlight the fact that something trulyextraordinary did crash in New Mexico, and that truly extraordinary events andmachinations were set in motion within the government because of it. The curiouscircumstance is that, of all the events within the history of American politicsin the twentieth century, it is the Roswell event that has called forth the mostofficial versions of what “really” happened. Not even the assassination ofPresident Kennedy, which has only two official Federal explanations, that of theWarren Commission, and the later explanation of the Joint Committee onAssassinations, called forth this amount of official obfuscations! We were told,first, that it was a captured flying saucer, then a weather balloon, thenvarious versions of the Japanese balloon bomb theory were floated by variouspeople with government connections and withdrawn almost as quickly, and finally,we were told that it was a top secret balloon called Mogul, which was used tomonitor potential Soviet nuclear tests to tell us exactly when the Russians had“the bomb.”There is another difficulty allied to the Roswell extraterrestrialcrash-and-retrieval scenario, and it is a logical one: If the American Federalgovernment is not to be believed on the basis of its inherent untrustworthinessand the apparent nuttiness of its last three explanations, why should it bebelieved in the case of its first, which was the nuttiest of them all? And bythe same token, it seems that few have noticed that the government’s last threeexplanations are in fact so lame that they seem to all but guarantee thecontinued life of its first one, along with all of its subsequently-added“extraterrestrial mythology.” To put it differently, the last three “officialexplanations” have in this author’s opinion all the signatures of deliberatelycontrived psychological operations whose objectives were not to kill the wholeextraterrestrial scenario of Roswell, but to keep it alive. But let us leavefurther discussions of such problems for the main body of this work…for now, letus return to our set of questions and mention one final question:> 5) Does the “Nazi scenario” make sense in a wider historical context?We shall see that it indeed does make sense, and much better sense than eitherof the other explanations for the Roswell event, whether it was the crash of anexotic extraterrestrial craft, or that of a top secret but nevertheless veryordinary balloon.C. METHODOLOGICAL OVERVIEW AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS The aforementioned set of questions carries with it an implicit methodology,namely, that the timeline of the Roswell event, as recounted and basicallyagreed upon within the ufology community, will be accepted at more or less facevalue, and deconstructed, i.e., an alternative explanation will be offered forthe components of the extraterrestrial scenario that the UFO community hascarefully researched and constructed, the components of which are outlined inthe previous series of questions. A closer look at the previous questionsreveals what these components are:> 1) A comparison of the alleged Roswell aerodynamic technology versus its Nazi> counterpart;> 2) The Nazi technology and underlying physics itself;> 3) The postwar activities of the Nazis, i.e., the “wider context”;> 4) A reconstruction of the Roswell Incident along a different interpretive> paradigm; and, finally,> 5) The wider context itself, which would include space and politics,> particularly in the United States of America.The methodology of this book is thus a “dialogue with the sources,” all thosepreviously mentioned well-known names within the Roswell-ufology and skeptics’communities. This book offers not new evidence, but a different interpretationof an old story, based on the very statements and research of those who haveadvanced and defended the Roswell extraterrestrial hypothesis.As a result of this examination, it will also become evident to the reader inthe main text that the testimony of the “witnesses”, whether primary orsecondary or “dead man,” is not sufficiently persuasive that the recoveredbodies were in fact “extraterrestrials,” for even when such shaky testimony isadmitted for the sake of argument, the specific descriptions of these allegedbodies can be rationalized along wholly terrestrial, though certainly anomalous,lines.D. SUCCINCT ABSTRACT OF THE CASE AND THE ARGUMENT So what, exactly, is the nature of the case?That case is based precisely on the story of the Roswell Incident itself, and onthe fact that it has been told in several distinct chronological layers, witheach layer emphasizing certain types of details. We may summarize the types ofdetails emphasized by each layer as follows, leaving the detailed examination ofeach layer in the ufologists’ own presentations of the story for the main text:> 1) The core story or “first articulation,” as first reported by the local> Roswell radio station, and subsequently by the local newspaper The Roswell> Daily Record and other newspapers around the country, was that a local rancher> had found curious debris on his ranch, and had reported it to the local> sheriff. The sheriff in turn urged the involvement of the local U.S. Army Air> Force (USAAF) Base, the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell, to investigate. The> 509th, as is now commonly known, was the only atomic bomb group in the USAAF> at that time. The base commander, Colonel William Blanchard, ordered his> intelligence officer, Major Jesse Marcel Sr., to investigate. On the basis of> this initial investigation, Blanchard then ordered the base public relations> officer, Walter Haut, to compose a press release stating that the USAAF had> recovered a crashed flying saucer. This release becomes the basis for the> Roswell Daily Record’s article, in which there is no mention of any recovered> extraterrestrial bodies. Thus, the first layer emphasizes only the crash and> retrieval of an exotic technology.> 2) The USAAF then gathered all the debris from the ranch and a second primary> crash site, sealed the base, and flew the wreckage to Fort Worth, along with> the base’s intelligence officer, Major Marcel(who, along with the base’s> counter-intelligence office, Sheridan Cavitt, were the first military men to> encounter the debris). There, according to Marcel, the debris was taken away,> and the debris of a crashed weather balloon was substituted for it. Marcel was> then ordered to have his picture taken with the substituted debris. Newspapers> around the country and the world carry the story that the “flying saucer” was> really only a crashed weather balloon. Thus the second layer attempts the> first official deconstruction of the recovered flying saucer story, seeking to> downplay the technology and to end public discussion of the incident and of> the retrieval of “something.”> 3) The Roswell story then laid dormant in the eye of the greater public for> about three decades, until a much older Jesse Marcel recounted his story to> Stanton Friedman. His story gave the first details of the extraordinary> properties of the debris found on the ranch. William Moore and Charles Berlitz> then broke the Roswell story, with the extraterrestrial interpretation, in> their celebrated book The Roswell Incident, and the “standard> Roswell-extraterrestrial scenario” began to enter the popular culture. Thus,> the third layer not only reemphasized the aspect of the recovery of an exotic> technology, but added two new elements, namely, that the technology recovered> was so extraordinary it had to be extraterrestrial, and that extraterrestrial> life forms themselves were recovered as a part of the operation. As we will> see, Major Marcel made no claims about the recovery of any bodies,> extraterrestrial or otherwise. His focus was solely upon the unusual and> extraordinary nature of the debris, of the technology. But in the presentation> of his story, Berlitz and Moore (with Stanton Friedman contributing research> for their book in the background), had uncovered “witnesses” who had seen the> now celebrated bodies. Thus, even when the Roswell Incident reemerges into the> popular culture, the very first articulation of that reemergence is of an> extraordinary technology, only at a later point in the new development are> bodies added to the story by other witnesses.> 4) After this period of initial reemergence, other witnesses came forward to> embellish the story with new details, which details now begin to emphasize the> recovery of “extraterrestrial” bodies and in some cases “alien autopsies” and> other funerary and pathological details. Many of these “eyewitnesses,” but by> no means all, were associated with members of the 509th Bomb Group or their> families or close associates, or allegedly had regular contact with them.> Thus, the third layer emphasizes the recovery of extraterrestrial life forms> and “corroborating” details.> 5) During this same period or “layer,” the first of the so-called MAJIC-12> documents were anonymously leaked to Jamie Shandera. These documents purported> to contain the first detailed descriptions of the alleged recovered> technology, as well as mentions of recovered extraterrestrial beings. A second> set of purported MAJIC-12 documents was allegedly leaked years later to> Timothy Cooper by a man calling himself “Cantwheel.” These documents> elaborated even further the technological details of the recovered debris and> again make mention of recovered extraterrestrial beings. Both sets of> documents – the Shandera and the Cooper-Cantwheel sets – also contained> details of the above-top-secret UFO study group allegedly established in> response to the Roswell event. Finally, and not to be overlooked even though> many both in the MJ-12 believers’ and disbelievers’ camps do so, the> Cooper-Cantwheel set of documents alluded to the presence of Nazis in> connection with the investigations of the recovered technology. Thus, the> fifth layer emphasized documentary “proof” of the recovery of> extra-terrestrial technology and extraterrestrials themselves, and, as a> corollary, a debate over whether or not said documentation is legitimate, or a> hoax.> 6) During the same approximate time period as the leaking of the> Cooper-Cantwheel set of documents, retired U.S. Army Lt. Colonel Philip Corso> wrote his now famous, or depending on one’s lights, infamous The Day After> Roswell, laying out his version of the crashed, recovered, and reverse> engineered exatraterrestrial craft. Corso, unlike many others who follow the> extraterrestrial interpretation of the Incident, made explicit claims for the> specific technologies he maintained we now possess due to this event and its> aftermath. Additionally, Corso, like the latter set of MAJIC-12 documents,> pointed a subtle finger at the Nazis, but the wider ufology community took> almost no notice, and makes almost no mention, of this curious and very> interesting fact and what it might actually portend not only about the> Incident, but about Corso himself and his motivations for writing his book.> Thus the sixth layer adds a new wrinkle to the crash and retrieval of> extraterrestrial technology and beings, for it also emphasizes that some of> that technology was reverse engineered and became the basis for many of the> technological accoutrements of modern life that we now take for granted.> Corso’s book thus added a further impetus to the methodological trend within> ufology that any exotic human technological advance, particularly in> aerodynamics, was to be explained on the basis of a crash and recovered ET> craft. Indeed, Corso’s book strongly reinforced that trend, and such may have> indeed been one of his possible hidden purposes in writing it.> 7) During the same period, other significant ufologists, Dr. Kevin Randle, Don> Schmitt, and Thomas J. Carey thoroughly reconstructed the basic Roswell> crash-and-recovery timeline. Randle and Friedmann also published significant> books examining the question of the authenticity of the MAJIC-12 documents.> The wider ufology community also engaged in a thorough deconstruction of the> U.S. Air Force’s latest “official balloon” explanation, the Mogul balloon> theory. During this most recent period, Thomas J. Carey’s and Donald R.> Schmitt’s Witness to Roswell was also published, adding more “witnesses,”> analysis, and yet another layer of the tightening of the extraterrestrial> interpretation. Thus, in the seventh and final layer, the elaborated story is> tightened and an attempt is made to resolve outstanding discrepancies or> difficulties. As we shall also discover, however, an unlikely witness came> forward to an unlikely individual, who added not a new “second hand dead man’s> testimony” to the elaboration of the extraterrestrial interpretation, but,> quite the opposite; he indicated explicitly that it was, indeed, something> directly tied to World War Two Nazi research. But other than celebrated author> and researcher Whitley Strieber, almost no one else noticed the major> significance of this witness, and the unusual and “non-Roswellian” context in> which his story broke. Compacting all this, the layers of the story may be summarized as follows:> 1) The First Layer: crash and retrieval of a flying saucer technology by the> U.S. Army Air Force;> 2) The Second Layer: the U.S. Army Air Force debunks its first story and> issues the first version of the “balloon” explanation;> 3) The Third Layer: the crash and recovery of a technology is again> emphasized, this time with a new element, the recovery of strange humanoid> bodies, which are claimed to be extraterrestrial;> 4) The Fourth Layer: the recovery of the strange bodies begins to be> emphasized with the “corroborating” details;> 5) The Fifth Layer: the MAJIC-12 documents are “leaked,” emphasizing the> recovery both of technology and extra terrestrial bodies;> 6) The Sixth Layer: Retired Army Lt. Col. Philip Corso publishes his famous> The Day After Roswell which mentions the recovery of extraterrestrial bodies> in order to promote his version of the event, which was that the recovered> “extraterrestrial” technology was secretly back-engineered and seeded into> American industry;> 7) The Seventh Layer: Additional witnesses come forward to testify to the ET> connection, and the chronology is tightened. From this brief synopsis, it will be immediately clear what the whole problemwith the Roswell-extraterrestrial scenario is, namely, that in its very firstarticulation, there is no mention whatsoever of any recovered extraterrestrialbodies or beings, or for that matter, bodies of any sort. All that is mentionedis a recovered technology. Even when the story first began to break out againafter its long period of dormancy, Jesse Marcel Sr.’s focus is on the recoveredtechnology and its, to him, other-worldly characteristics. Only later in theincreasingly embellished story does one encounter actual extraterrestrials, asnew witnesses step forward to add this type of detail. The detail is further“corroborated” by the leaked MJ-12 documents, and given a new impetus by Lt.Col. Corso’s book.It is these two discrete data sets – the alleged technology, and the alleged(extraterrestrial) bodies – that will preoccupy us in the main body of thiswork, and the crucial question with respect to them is this: assuming that thestory of recovered bodies is true, does the technology interpret the bodies, ordo the bodies interpret the technology? And are any of the specificallydescribed characteristics of these bodies sufficient to compel to the conclusionthat they were extraterrestrial, or are there possible terrestrial explanationsfor these characteristics? Similarly, are the details of the debris as describedby primary firsthand witnesses sufficient to compel to the conclusion that itsorigin was extraterrestrial? And if the answer to those questions be “no,” thenhow does one account for the military’s apparent continued obfuscation of thestory down to this very day? Clearly something extraordinary must be involved inorder for this to be the case.Additionally, what happens to either of these conflicting data sets and thescenarios constructed from them when one considers the possibility that, as isevident from their emergence much later in the story, the bodies were perhapsdeliberately added to the “evidence” or the story much later, or, similarly,when this detail was emphasized after the fact? Is it possible to explain thisaddition from a terrestrially-based scenario? And finally, if this detail wasadded, who added it, and why? In short, why does the Roswell Incident in itsearliest articulation emphasize the technology, and in its later articulationsthe bodies?E. FINAL PERSONAL NOTES In proposing the Nazi-Roswell scenario, I wish to state again, clearly,categorically, and for the record, that I am not philosophically opposed to theexistence of “extraterrestrials,” nor to the view that “they” have been or maybe visiting “us.” Similarly, I am not of the opinion that the Nazi or any otherterrestrial interpretation accounts for all UFO sightings or events. I am onlymaintaining that it accounts for some of them, Roswell possibly and in myopinion most likely being one of them.2Therein is the key word: “possibly.” I make no claim for the probabilities of myargument, only for its possibility. However, as will be evident in the main bodyof this work, by the same token, I do not follow the standard method - soprevalent in the extraterrestrial interpretations of Roswell – of turningSherlock Holmes on his head, and ignoring the possible explanations in order toopt for the improbable one. Or to put it in Chestertonian diction: if one grantsthe extraordinary nature of the event and the alleged recovered technologies,then any terrestrial explanation for it, howsoever extraordinary and improbable,is preferable to any extraterrestrial explanation for it, howsoever possible, ifit makes sense of roughly the same data set.In short, the Roswell extraterrestrial scenario has become such a part of thehymnography of the ufology community that every apparently exotic terrestrialtechnology – including the Nazis’ - is to be explained on the basis that itoriginated with a crashed and recovered extraterrestrial craft which wasreverse-engineered. So “pervasive” is this inane music that few people seem tonotice its hidden sociological and psychological impact within that community,namely, that as an explanation it serves to disincline people to look for andconstruct speculative terrestrial explanations for such technologies and events.It serves, in effect, to close off discussion and to deflect attention away fromvery real human achievements in physics and engineering. Secondly – as Isomewhat humorously observed in conversation to one such ufologist (whoattempted to discredit all my research into World War Two Nazi technology, andredirect it once again to crashed and reverse engineered extraterrestrialtechnologies, this time by Nazis, as he mentioned the story of crashed saucersin the Black Forest ca. 1936, for which not a shred of evidence exists). If thisexplanation continues to be used in each and all such instances, as myufological interloper used it, its utility as an explanation for the ufologycommunity will ultimately call into question the whole extraterrestrialhypothesis itself, for sooner or later, having recovered and reverse-engineeredso much advanced extraterrestrial technology, humanity will have to startcrashing its advanced technology on ET’s world so he can catch back up with us.I knew at the outset of writing this book, and know now upon its conclusion,that I will not persuade any of the “classical and standard names” withinufology nor within the narrower Roswell research community of the problems withtheir speculative reconstruction of what happened, just as they have notpersuaded me that what crashed there was indeed extraterrestrial. I knowsimilarly that I will not persuade the well-known and respected Roswell skepticsof the folly of their advocacy of the loony Mogul balloon hypothesis either. Ihope only to convince the unconvinced who are caught like myself in theno-man’s-land in between these two entrenched camps. I hope to convince them ofthe folly of my own speculative reconstruction, for my folly is indeed based onthe much bigger, and now well-known, folly of the American government and thedeals with the Nazi devil it made in the final months of World War Two, and tothe enduring folly that that Faustian bargain engendered. That folly included -much to the shocked surprise and near panic of the very American military andintelligence community that struck the bargain - the fact that the very best ofthe Nazi scientists and technologies remained in Nazi hands after the war, andcontinued to be researched by them independently of any of the victoriouspostwar powers.3Any book about the Roswell Incident – after all the research, interviews,comparisons, study, witnesses and documents are weighed and the artillerybarrages have ended – is a matter of argued interpretation and speculation. Thisany honest Roswell researcher, whether “believers” such as Stanton Friedman, DonBerliner, or Kevin Randle, or whether “skeptics” such as the late Karl Pflock,will admit. Each of us must contend with a vast pile of testimony, documents,and data, and must, as best as our lights indicate, include a wider context thatwe believe to be relevant to the case. Obviously, each “school ofinterpretation” also comes to the Incident with its own presuppositions,prejudices, and paradigms. I do so, firstly, because I believe the Nazi scenariohas been given rather short shrift in the Roswell research community, andsecondly, with the desire to state that interpretation in a manner that I hopedoes justice to the research of these other men. But in the end, it remains - asdoes theirs - an argued and speculative case. In pointing out what I believe tobe a certain tendentiousness on the part of these researchers in some cases, Ido not wish the reader to draw the conclusion that I am impugning either theirhonesty or integrity, for just as easily, they can point out my owntendentiousness. All of us, without exception, are arguing from certainambiguities in the Roswell Incident record to a case we hope is worthconsideration, the skeptic for one interpretation, the extraterrestrialadvocates for another, and I, for yet a third. If there is anything unusual inmy own interpretation, it is that I grant the extraordinary nature of the eventand materials, and argue for a terrestrial, though politically explosive, originof it, and for that reason, I argue that both the technology, and its suspectedorigins, were carefully hidden from the public, recuperating from a long andexhausting war with an unspeakable evil that it had supposedly defeated, and notmerely forced into hiding. Like those honest researchers with whom I conduct a“dialogue with the sources” in the main text of this work, I leave it to thereader to decide if I have argued a reasonable and plausible case.So, with these preliminary thoughts in mind, down to the business ofpresentation, analysis, speculation, and argument itself…Joseph P FarrellSpearfish, South Dakota2010image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Cited in Steven M.

It is a story that much like a classical myth growswith each generational retelling, acquiring new nuances, new characters, and anincreasingly complex plotline. Like all myths, it has become part of the generalcultural landscape, at least in America. Within the narrower ufology community,however, it has assumed almost the status of a religious icon; it is a reveredsymbol of the extraterrestrial faith and an article of its creed. Indeed, it isfor the twin reasons that the story continues to be embellished, and continuesto be covered-up, that Charles Berlitz and William Moore could observe that itis an incident “that is still going on.”1But like all myths, the Roswell incident has a core of truth to it, and thereinlies the problem, for just exactly what that core may be is a matter of somedebate.A. THE JULY 8, 1947 ARTICLES IN THE ROSWELL DAILY RECORD1. THE MAIN ARTICLE However, in what may be a surprise to some, in its first articulation, theRoswell story did not start out to be a story about recovered extraterrestrials— whether dead or alive — nor even a story about a recovered extraterrestrialvehicle and its secret reverse-engineering by the U.S. military. It was simply astory about a crashed “flying saucer” and the fact the U.S. Army Air Force2 hadrecovered it and taken it to the local airbase near Roswell. The story wasreported on July 8, 1947, in the local Roswell Daily Record:> RAAF3 Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch in Roswell Region:> No Details of Flying Disk are Revealed:> Roswell Hardware Man and Wife Report Disk Seen. > The intelligence officer of the 509th Bombardment group at the Roswell Army> Air Field announced at noon today, that the field has come into possession of> a flying saucer.> According to information released by the department, over authority of Maj.> J.A. Marcel, intelligence officer, the disk was recovered on a ranch in the> Roswell vicinity, after an unidentified rancher had notified Sheriff Geo.> Wilcox, here, that he had found the instrument on his premises.> Major Marcel and a detail from his department went to the ranch and recovered> the disk, it was stated.> After the intelligence office here had inspected the instrument it was flown> to “higher headquarters.”> The intelligence office stated that no details of the saucer’s construction or> its appearance had been revealed.> Mr. and Mrs. Dan Wilmot apparently were the only persons in Roswell who have> seen what they thought was a flying disk.> They were sitting on their porch at 105 South Penn. Street last Wednesday> night at about ten minutes before ten o’clock when a large glowing object> zoomed out of the sky from the southeast, going in a northwesterly direction> at a high rate of speed.> Wilmot called Mrs. Wilmot’s attention to it and both ran down into the yard to> watch. It was in sight less than a minute, perhaps 40 or 50 seconds, Wilmot> estimated.> Wilmot said that it appeared to him to be about 1,500 high and going fast. He> estimated between 400 and 500 miles per hour.> In appearance it looked oval in shape like two inverted saucers, faced mouth> to mouth, or like two old type washbowls placed together in the same fashion.> The entire body glowed as though light were showing through from inside,> though not like it would be if a light were merely underneath.> From where he stood Wilmot said that the object looked to be about 5 feet in> size, and making allowance for the distance it was from town he figured it> must have been 15 or 20 feet in diameter, though this was just a guess.> Wilmot said that he heard no sound but that Mrs. Wilmot said she heard a> swishing sound for a very short time.> The object came into view from the southeast and disappeared over the treetops> in the general vicinity of six-mile hill.> Wilmot, who is one of the most respected and reliable citizens in town, kept> the story to himself hoping that someone else would come out and tell about> having seen one, but finally today decided that he would go ahead and tell> about seeing it. The announcement that the RAAF was in possession of one came> only a few minutes after he had decided to release the details of what he had> seen.4It is important to take stock of what this article actually does say, and whatit does not say.The first and most obvious point about the article is that it mentions nothingwhatsoever about recovered bodies of any sort, extraterrestrial or otherwise. Bythe same token, it mentions nothing whatsoever of multiple crash sites, a detailwhich emerges in later articulations of the Roswell story. It mentions merelyone site. In doing so, the article, on the basis of the U.S. Army Air Force’sown press release of noon the same day — July 8, 1947 — also states explicitlythat what was recovered at this site was a singular object, a “disk,” an“instrument,” and not debris. Finally, it is to be observed that absolutely nodescriptions of this “disk” or “instrument” are forthcoming in the article. Infact, the article somewhat curiously and ambiguously observes that “Theintelligence office stated that no details of the saucer’s construction or itsappearance had been revealed.” While this might be taken to mean that thepreliminary investigation of the recovered “instrument” at the Roswell Army AirField had revealed no significant clues, the curious phrasing of the statementmight also be understood to indicate that some sort of investigation had beenconducted by other personnel than those directly connected with the base, andthat the results of this investigation were not revealed to the upper echelonsof the base’s personnel. Finally, the article explicitly states that the “disk”or “instrument” was then flown “to higher headquarters.” This statement occursprior to the curious statement that nothing had been revealed. One may conclude,therefore, from the article, and taking its statements at face value, that somesort of investigation had indeed been performed, and that nothing of thisinvestigation was revealed to the Roswell base personnel. Howsoever one parsesthese two statements, it is clear that some sort of investigation was beingundertaken, either at the Roswell base, or subsequently at “higherheadquarters,” and that the results of this were not made available to basepersonnel, or if they were, that the base personnel were not talking about it.All this is very significant in the light of the Army Air Force’s subsequentattempt to maintain that the recovered “disk” or “instrument” had been mistakenby the Roswell military personnel as a standard weather balloon, not only by theintelligence officer of the only atomic bomb base in the Army Air Force at thattime — Major Jesse Marcel — but, as the article subtly hints, by the secondinvestigation at “higher headquarters” itself, for recall, the article mentionstwo investigations: Marcel’s initial “inspection,” and the subsequentinvestigation “at higher headquarters,” and the article leaves open the slimpossibility of yet a third investigation at the base itself by parties unknown.The second intriguing thing about the article is the Wilmot sighting theprevious Wednesday. While there is nothing within the article that suggests thatwhat the Wilmots saw was one and the same thing that the Roswell Army Air Fieldrecovered on the anonymous rancher’s fields, it is important to take note of thephysical characteristics the Wilmots observed:> 1) The object was disk or oval shaped;> 2) It travelled at an altitude of approximately 1,500 feet above the ground,> according to Mr. Wilmot’s guess;> 3) It travelled silently;> 4) It glowed as it did so;> 5) It made either no sound, or, as Mrs. Wilmot observed, made a slight> “swishing” noise; and finally,> 6) Mr. Wilmot guessed its speed to be between 400 to 500 miles per hour. These observations require some analysis in the light of the fact that, as partof the growing Roswell story, it is later claimed that somethingextraterrestrial was recovered, along with extra-terrestrial beings, for theWilmots, accustomed to living near an Army Air Field from which B-29 bombers —the only bombers in the American arsenal capable at that time of carrying atombombs — regularly landed and took off, would have some rough ideas of the speedof aircraft at low altitudes, and thus, Mr. Wilmot’s estimation of speeds of 400to 500 miles per hour for what he saw might be an adequate guess as to itsactual speed.Assuming that what the Wilmots saw was a technology of some sort, then what theysaw was> 1) Clearly exotic, since it travelled at high speed and low altitude with> either no sound or virtually no sound, compared to a B-29 which, at such low> altitudes and speeds would have made a great deal of noise;> 2) Clearly exotic, since it glowed as it did so, and B-29’s obviously do not> glow as they fly; and yet,> 3) Was not exotic enough to be practical as an interplanetary vehicle, much> less an interstellar one, since the reported and guessed-at speed was far too> slow for such a craft to have been used for practical interplanetary or> interstellar craft. While the argument might be advanced that the observed and> guessed-at speed was no accurate gauge of its optimum performance, and thus> that the observed object might indeed originate off world, this is an argument> from silence, and hence not valid. By the same token, what the Wilmots saw> cannot be used as a basis by which to interpret what the Roswell Army Air> Field recovered from the ranch, for there is no way of knowing if the two> reported objects were in fact one and the same, or, if they were not, were the> products of a similar technology. However, as will be eventually seen, the detail that this object glowed is asignificant detail that will re-enter the Roswell story later on. Thus, what theWilmots saw may have a direct bearing on the interpretation of that laterdetail, and hence of the Roswell event itself.2. THE FORGOTTEN ARTICLE Also on the front page of the newspaper, however, was a short article carried bythe AP Wire and datelined Portland, Oregon, an article often overlooked byresearchers of the Roswell Incident, though the article bears directly on theevent:> Air Force General Says Army Not Doing Experiments: > Portland, Ore., July 8 (AP) — The Oregonian said today that Maj. Gen. Nathan> P. Twining, chief of the AAF material command, told it flatly that the “flying> saucers” are not the result of experiments by the armed services. > “Neither the AAF nor any other component of the armed forces had any plane,> guided missile or other aerial device under development which could possibly> be mistaken for a saucer or formation of flying disks,” the newspaper quoted> Twining as telling it by telephone from Kirtland Army Airbase, Albuquerque,> N.M.> It continued its quotation: “Some of these witnesses evidently saw something> but we don’t know what we are investigating.”> Meanwhile, air National Guard squadrons flying from Portland, Boise and> Spokane bases patrolled Pacific Northwest skies late yesterday, landing after> sundown, without observing any of the objects.> Col. G. Robert Doddson, commanding the 123rd and 116th squadrons, said> camera-equipped planes would take the air twice daily from the three fields.5This little article, so often overlooked, is crucial for a number of veryimportant reasons.Note what it actually states:> 1) Major General Nathan Twining is at this time chief of the Air Materials> command;> 2) General Twining was at Kirtland Airbase in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on the> very day of that the two articles ran in the Roswell Daily Record;> 3) General Twining specifically and explicitly states that the U.S. Army Air> Force is “investigating”, which could be taken in three ways:> a) It is investigating the general UFO, or as it was then known, the general> “flying saucer,” phenomenon; or,> b) It is investigating the specific instance of the Roswell “flying saucer,”> or,> c) It is investigating both the general phenomenon and the specific Roswell> event;> 4) General Twining also states explicitly that the U.S. Army Air Force does> not really know “what it is investigating,” i.e., has not come to any positive> conclusions about what it is, much less where it comes from;> 5) The Pacific Northwest Air National Guard was apparently patrolling the> skies far from New Mexico with camera-equipped aircraft. image [images/00004.jpg] The Roswell Daily Record, July 8, 1947. The “Forgotten Article” is in the SecondColumn from the Right, Toward the Bottom One may draw some additional inferences from this list.First, since General Twining was the head of the U.S. Army Air Force’s AirMaterial Command, that is to say, head of the department that oversawinvestigation and development of aerospace technology, one may reasonably assumethat these investigations were primarily of a technological nature. Secondly,one must assume that the Air National Guard squadrons mentioned in the articlewere on some sort of patrol or alert, and that this was related to the Roswellevent, since the article reports this detail in not only within the context of awider discussion of flying saucers, but within the historical time frame of theRoswell event itself. That is to say, the U.S. Army Air Force was attempting toshed some light on what they were by capturing photographs of them. This issignificant, for it indicates that it suspected the previous UFO sightings inthe Pacific Northwest — one only need consider the celebrated sighting ofKenneth Arnold barely a month previously — could shed some light on whatever hadhappened in Roswell, for according to the article Twining was at Kirtland AirBase in Albuquerque. We will have occasion to return to the famous KennethArnold sighting, and General Twining’s presence in New Mexico during theincident, later in this book.B. A SUMMARY OF THE FIRST ARTICULATION OF THE ROSWELL INCIDENT While General Nathan Twining’s presence at Kirtland Army Air Force Base inAlbuquerque during the Roswell Incident gives some credence to the ideasuggested above, namely, that some other investigation was undertaken by theUSAAF at a higher level than the senior officers of the 509th Bomb Group inRoswell, we must nonetheless forego, for the moment, speculative reconstructionsof the Incident to summarize the actual facts of the First Articulation of theIncident themselves.> 1) In its first articulation, the Roswell story is about nothing more, and> nothing less, than the retrieval of a “flying saucer;”> 2) The implication of the USAAF’s press release via base press officer Walter> Haut to the local media is that an exotic technology was recovered from (and> therefore had crashed in) the New Mexico desert;> 3) The incident occurred during a period of an apparent wider nationwide alert> against “flying saucers,” as is evident from the “forgotten article” about Air> National Guard alerts in the Pacific Northwest;> 4) The presence of General Twining, head of the Army Air Force’s Air Material> Command and therefore head of a department with responsibilities to> investigate foreign technological achievements, may indicate a larger> significance to the incident;> 5) Finally, and most importantly, there is no mention of any recovered bodies> — human or otherwise — in the first articulation. Of equal significance is> that there is no mention of a second crash site, for the clear implication of> the Roswell Daily Record article is that the there was only one site involved.But this story would quickly change, as we shall now see.image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Charles Berlitz and William Moore, The Roswell Incident (New York: Grossettand Dunlap, 1980), p. 3.2 The Air Force at the time of the incident was not yet a separate servicebranch of the American military, but was a branch of the U.S. Army.3 RAAF, i.e., Roswell Army Airfield, ed.4 No author, “RAAF Captures Flying Saucer on Ranch in Roswell Region,” RoswellDaily Record, Vol. 42 Number 99, Tuesday, July 8, 1947, p. 1, emphasis added.5 No author, “Air Force General Says Army Not Doing Experiments,” Roswell DailyRecord, Vol. 42 Number 99, Tuesday, July 8, 1947, p. 1, emphasis added."},{"pageContent":"2THE SECOND ARTICULATION:BERLITZ-MOORE-FRIEDMAN,AND THEEMERGENCE OF THE STANDARD SCENARIO > “From a public-interest point of view, new statements from witnesses, and the> families of witnesses who were previously unwilling to make statements, and> ‘afterthoughts’ from some of the military personnel involved in the cover-up> present in the follow pages rather convincing proof that this crash of a space> ship was definitely not a mass delusion but an actual event.”> Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore1 The biggest problem with the Roswell Incident is that it is a continuouslyevolving story; its “facts” are constantly being debated, its “timeline” is everin flux, and there is no general consensus on what actually happened. Adding tothe confusion is the less-than rigorous research and presentation methodsfollowed by almost all parties in the debate. Consider, for example, thefollowing statement of Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore at the beginning oftheir book, The Roswell Incident:> Events which had been reported in the press and by radio… indicate that> material from the wrecked UFO was shuttled by high-security government> transportation from base to base and that the remains of the UFO and the dead> occupants (one of whom was reportedly alive when found) are under> high-security guard at CIA headquarters at Langley, Virginia.2 But as was seen from the first chapter and the Roswell Daily Record itself, theonly part of this statement that is true is the fact that parts of the wreckagewere flown “to higher headquarters.” There is no mention in the initialreporting of the event, however, that any “dead occupants” were recovered, norwas there any mention of the involvement of the CIA, which in any case, at thetime of the incident itself, did not yet officially exist and would not existuntil President Truman signed the National Security Act into law later thatyear, in September.Notwithstanding this minor CIA inaccuracy, Berlitz’s and Moore’s The RoswellIncident constitutes the first re-emergence of the event into the popularconsciousness, and as such, it forms the skeleton around which the “conventionalwisdom”3 was built up over the years by other researchers.4 A close examinationof Berlitz’s and Moore’s presentation of “the conventional wisdom” is thereforein order.A. THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM:1. THE INTERRUPTED TELETYPE: LYDIA SLEPPY Berlitz and Moore begin their presentation of the standard scenario with a storythat was to become famous in Roswell lore, the story of Lydia Sleppy, and “theinterrupted teletype.” According to them, Sleppy was an administrator for radiostation KOAT in Albuquerque who also was the teletype operator. At approximately4 PM on July 7, 1947, she received a telephone call from Johnny McBoyle, a partowner of station KSWS in Roswell. Since KSWS did not have a teletype of its own,it occasionally used the KOAT teletype when it had something newsworthy toreport on the wire.5This time, as Lydia Sleppy answered the phone, “his voice was excited”:> Understandably bemused, Lydia placed the phone in the uncomfortable> position between ear and shoulder and started to type McBoyle’s startling> statements into the teletype. But after she had typed only several sentences> the machine suddenly stopped itself. As this is a common occurrence with> teletypes for a variety of reasons, Lydia was not concerned, although she had> never been cut off the air before in the middle of a transmission. Moving the> telephone from her neck to her hand, she informed McBoyle that the teletype> had stopped at her end.> This time, according to her recollections, he seemed not only excited but> under pressure and apparently speaking to someone else at the same time. His> voice seemed strained. “Wait a minute, I’ll get back to you…. Wait…. I’ll get> right back.” But he did not. Instead, the teletype went on again by itself and> started addressing Albuquerque, or Lydia, directly. The sender was not> identified and the tone was formal and curt: ATTENTION ALBUQUERQUE: DO NOT> TRANSMIT. REPEAT DO NOT TRANSMIT THIS MESSAGE. STOP COMMUNICATION IMMEDIATELY.> As Lydia still had McBoyle on the phone she told him what had just come over> the teletype and asked: “What do I do now?”> His reply was unexpected. “Forget about it. You never heard it. Look, you’re> not supposed to know. Don’t talk about it to anyone.”> (McBoyle later told Lydia Sleppy that he had witnessed a plane, which he said> was destined for Wright Field — Wright-Patterson6 — take off with the object> or parts of it on board, but was unable to get anywhere near it because of the> tight security maintained by heavily armed guards.7 This story, if true, is one of the first mentions of recovered bodies inconjunction with the Roswell crash. But there are two crucial peculiarities tobe noted about McBoyle’s statements as far as Lydia Sleppy was able to recallthem:> 1) McBoyle clearly places the location of these recovered bodies at the crash> site on the ranch, in other words, we are not yet dealing with two crash> sites; and,> 2) McBoyle describes these bodies as “little men,” but does not qualify this> explanation to indicate in any way that the beings are unusual enough to> warrant being classified as “extraterrestrial.”Additionally, one must also observe something else, namely, that the debrisitself is described as a “crumpled dishpan.” This important data point must beborn in mind when we later encounter subsequent descriptions of the recovereddebris and its remarkable properties.Finally, the “interrupted teletype” story is also, in Berlitz’s and Moore’spresentation, the first mention of the ultimate destiny of the Roswell Debris:Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. Wright Field, as already noted, was theheadquarters to General Nathan Twining’s Air Material Command and eventually wasalso headquarters to the Air Technical Intelligence Command, and was also theheadquarters of noted Nazi supersonic flight and ramjet specialist, Dr. WaltherLippisch, whose P-13 delta wing ramjet craft allegedly made a supersonic flighttest prior to the end of the Second World War. From the standpoint of theinternal logic of the “standard scernario” and notwithstanding the credibilityor lack thereof of the actual interrupted teletype story — as well as from thestandpoint of the “Nazi scenario being proposed here — Wright Field is a logicaldestination for the Roswell debris.Lydia Sleppy also recounted how KOAT station owner Merle Tucker was concernedabout the loss of his station’s broadcasting license as a result of theincident,8 and also related that Tucker attempted to contact other witnesses tothe incident, who “insisted that the object had come down in the area was ofSocorro, New Mexico, rather than near Roswell.”9 Subsequent attempts by Moore,Berlitz, and Friedman to interview Tucker and McBoyle proved fruitless, for bothmen were very reluctant to talk about it.103. PREJUDICING THE RESPONSE: INITIAL INQUIRIES OF THE PRO-ET SCENARIO At this juncture in their presentation Berlitz and Moore attempt to place theRoswell Incident into a wider ufological and historical context, and while wewill expand on this context tremendously in Part Three of the present work, itis worth pausing to consider their own presentation and its prejudicialassumptions. They begin by noting that the Roswell Incident was “relativelyclose in time to the June 24 sighting of the famous flight of nine ‘pie pans’over Mount Ranier, Washington, by Kenneth Arnold,” the sighting which, in fact,“led to the general use of the term flying saucers to describe them.”11So far, so good. But what Berlitz and Moore — and their “investigator in thebackground,” Stanton T. Friedman — fail to point out is the close resemblance ofArnold’s sketch of what he saw to a top-secret Nazi flying wing project, that ofthe Go-229 of the Horten brothers.image [images/00005.jpg] Kenneth Arnold Holding his own Sketch of The Craft He Saw near Mount Ranier,Washington, 1947 image [images/00006.jpg] A Horten Flying Wing in Test Flight, Note the Similarity to Arnold’s Sketch image [images/00007.jpg] A Horten Design for a Jet Propelled Flying Wing: Note the Similarity to KennethArnold’s Sketch, and to the American B-1 Stealth Bomber The resemblance of Arnold’s sketch to actual flying Nazi designs, as well as toprojected Horten projects, is readily apparent and obvious. The question is, isthe omission of the mention of this similarity on Berlitz’s and Moore’s part amere oversight, or is it an indicator of a larger pattern, and of a differentkind of cover-up?Part of the answer to that question may be indicated by an observation Berlitzand Moore make shortly after introducing the wider ufological context of 1947,including the Arnold sighting:> These subsequent reports indicated a swirling UFO activity by night and by day> in Arizona and New Mexico — an activity easily justified by the fact that in> the late 1940s New Mexico was the site of the major portion of America’s> postwar defense efforts in atomic research, rocketry, aircraft and missile> development, and radar-electronics experimentation. Los Alamos, the sprawling> scientific community created by the Manhattan Project in 1943 especially to> provide the manpower and facilities necessary for the wartime construction and> testing of the worlds’ first atomic bombs, was still a “secret city” in 1947 —> a highly restricted area. Of similar status was the White Sands Missile Range> and Proving Grounds around Alamogordo, where top-level research was being> carried out on the only captured German V-2 rockets in existence on our side> of the Iron Curtain. Also stationed in New Mexico, at Roswell, was the only> combat-trained atom-bomb group in the world at that time — the 509th Bomb> Group of the U.S. Army Air Force. All of which makes it somewhat easier to> understand why, in those summer months of 1947, New Mexico experienced more> UFO sightings both per capita and per square mile than any other state in the> union. Certainly alien intelligences systematically engaged in the observation> of this planet and its civilization could be expected to concentrate their> efforts on monitoring those areas exhibiting the highest levels of scientific> and technological activity.12 But Berlitz’s and Moore’s observations raise as many problematical questions anddifficulties as it solves:> 1) If, as is so often alleged, “ET’s” technology was so far superior to our> own as to allow such inter-stellar “reconnaissance,” then why would they> bother with such antiquated technologies as atom-bombs and rockets? In other> words, from one standpoint, the observation — and Friedman would make it again> as we shall see — makes sense, and yet, from the standpoint of the technology> discrepancy alleged to exist between human and “extraterresrtrial” technology,> it does not. It would be analogous to the United States Navy committing> resources to monitor the technological progress of the natives of Fiji.> 2) Thus, what the reconnaissance activity of the New Mexico UFOs may also> represent is an activity of a terrestrially-based power, keeping close> scrutiny on its major technological adversary. If there was a post-war Nazi> “International,” an extra-territorial Nazi “state” continuing to develop and> conduct its research into technologies developed during the war, as I have> argued elsewhere,13 then it stands to reason that it would know of the large> scale American effort to bring former Nazi scientists to this country to> develop its own black projects, and would monitor those efforts closely by any> and every means available to it. Consequently, in the absence — at this> juncture — of evidence to support either the ET or Nazi “reconnaissance”> interpretations, but following also the dictum of Ockham’s Razor, a> preponderance of weight must be invested in the latter explanation, since it> is also known that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union, at that> time, had developed technologies as radical and advanced as the late-war Nazi> Projects. A final possibility also hovers over these postwar UFO incursions into Americanairspace, and that is:> 3) Whoever is behind these incursions might also be trying to send a message> to American military authorities, namely, that “we can enter your most> sensitive airspace over your most sensitive projects with impunity, and there> is little you can do about it.” That message is as likely to be sent by> post-war Nazis as by curious and somewhat menacing extra-terrestrials.But what does all this represent in the case of the Second Articulation of theRoswell Incident? Briefly, it is this: if the omission of the resemblancebetween Kenneth Arnold’s sketch and the Nazi Flying Wings of the Hortenbrothers, and if the tendentious prejudicing of the “UFO reconnaissance” infavor of an “extraterrestrial” explanation represents not a mere coincidence butpart of an agenda on Berlitz’s, Moore’s, and Friedman’s part, then why wouldthey do so? Why direct attention away from a potential terrestrial explanation?The answer is implicit in the question, for there was only one terrestrial powerthat had access to technology even remotely similar to that being claimed for“ET,” and that was Nazi Germany. Thus, if the recovered debris at Roswellrepresented something Nazi and if it was not the product of a post-war Americanproject continuing to develop such technologies — as with the Lippischsuper-sonic projects in Ohio — then it must either represent a Sovietcontinuation of Nazi research, or, worst of all, an independent Nazicontinuation of the projects. As well be seen in Part Three, there is nowevidence to suggest that it was the latter.However, if this was known to the U.S. military at that time, then there isabundant reason to believe that the cover-up began almost instantly, and beganto subtly focus on “ET” as the explanation at the outset, to deflect attentionaway from considering the far more profound and sinister implications of a Nazicrash in New Mexico. In this respect, we must now observe the following:> 1) The original story, as recorded in the Roswell Daily Record of July 8,> 1947, was a story controlled throughout by the military, in the form of the> Roswell Base Commander, Colonel William “Butch” Blanchard, and its press> officer, 1st Lt. Walter Haut;> 2) The subsequent reemergence of the story, in its “second articulation” for> popular consumption in The Roswell Incident, by Berlitz, Moore, and background> investigator Stanton T. Friedman, is itself connected, via all three men, to> the military in the form of black projects, or to intelligence, for in the> case of Berlitz and Moore, both men are suspected of having such backgroungs.> Moreover, Moore has confessed to having, intelligence backgrounds by> confessing to having deliberately fed disinformation to the ufology community> in return for “inside information.” In the case of Freidman, we have an> individual who, by his own admission, worked on many top secret nuclear and> nuclear aircraft propulsion projects in the 1950s. One must therefore entertain due caution, and always be aware of the fact, thatthe “conventional wisdom” of the Roswell Incident might itself be “deepdisinformation.” This case shall be argued more completely in Part Three, butattention is drawn to it here so that the reader may scrutinize not only what isbeing said, but who is saying it, and the backgrounds of the researcherspresenting it.Thus, when a Berlitz and Moore claim that “It is interesting to consider that,at the very beginning of the 1947 UFO flap, and attested to by witnesses, pressreleases, interviews, radio reports, and uninhibited by censorship that came toolate, the Army Air Force came into possession of a bona-fide UFO together withthe remains of its crew,”14 the reader may exercise due caution and skepticism,for as has been seen, the earliest reports of the Roswell wreckage recoverymention only recovered wreckage, and no crew. Nor do Berlitz and Moore anywhereprovide any such media reference to buttress their claim of a recovered crew.That part of the story begins to emerge as a later layer and development. Butfirst, what of the Army Air Force’s actual press release?3. 1ST LIEUTENANT WALTER HAUT’S PRESS RELEASE The public part of the Roswell Incident began with 1st Lieutenant Walter Haut’spress release to the world.> On July 8, one day after Mrs. Sleppy’s unusual incident with the TWX teletype> machine, Lieutenant Walter Haut, public information officer at the Roswell> Amry Air Base, acting on information beginning to filter in to the Roswell Air> Base, jumped the gun in a burst of excitement and enthusiastically issued the> following release to members of the press without first bothering to obtain> the authorization of his base commander, Colonel William Blanchard — an> oversight he was to be made painfully aware of later: > Roswell Army Air Base, Roswell, N.M.> 8th July, 1947, A.M. > “The many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the> intelligence office of the 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell> Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through the> cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff’s office of Chaves> County.> “The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not> having phone facilities, the rancher stored the disc until such time as he was> able to contact the sheriff’s office, who in turn notified Major Jesse A.> Marcel of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Office.> “Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at the rancher’s> home. It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned> by Major Marcel to higher headquarters.”15Notably the press release, as actually cited by the San Francisco Chronicle inits July 9, 1947 edition, closely parallels the wording of the Roswell DailyRecord article of July 8, 1947, so one may reasonably assume that this text doesrepresent the actual text dictated by Lt. Haut or something close to it.image [images/00008.jpg] 1st Lieutenant Walter Haut at the Time of the Roswell Incident There is, however, one point in Berlitz’s and Moore’s characterization of thesequence of events that bears scrutiny, and that is that Lt. Haut issued hispress release in a hot-flash of excitement, and did not obtain the authorizationof the base commander, Col. William “Butch” Blanchard.image [images/00009.jpg] Colonel William “Butch” Blanchard, Commander, 509th Atomic Bomb Group, RoswellArmy Air Field as he looked at the Time of the Incident This assertion is simply incredible and ridiculous on the face of it. It ishighly unlikely that Lt. Haut would have issued any such release concerningsensitive information without prior consultation with Colonel Blanchard, and aswe shall see, there is indirect evidence of such consultation. With Soviet spiesprowling New Mexico to learn whatever they could of American secret research,any such releases would implicitly involve issues of national security, andLieutenant Haut — and more importantly — Colonel Blanchard — would have knownthis. This implies something very significant, for it makes it very unlikelythat the original story of a crashed flying saucer represents the pureunvarnished truth, and far more likely that there is an element — as yetundefined — of deliberate disinformation involved to conceal something themilitary did not want revealed, whether top secret balloon programs, orsomething else. To put it quite succinctly, the Roswell skeptics may be right;the “recovered flying saucer” story may itself be the initial cover-up.image [images/00010.jpg] July 9, 1947 San Francisco Chronicle Text of the Haut Press Release We note two final things about the press release. Firstly, the recoveredwreckage is described as a “disc,” with the implication still being that thereis but one crash site. Secondly, there was apparently a preliminaryinvestigation of the wreckage performed at the Roswell Army Air Base prior toits being shipped to “higher headquarters.”However, subsequently to the Haut press release, according to the “conventionalwisdom,” the “cover-up” began, and a curtain of iron-clad secrecy slammed downand a new layer of disinformation arose to shroud the event:> Several hours later, a new bit of information was suddenly released. It now> appeared that the object was merely a crashed weather balloon. Most papers> copied this new information, with the notable exception of the Washington> Post, which referred rather pointedly to a “news blackout.”> Meanwhile, Brigadier General Roger M. Ramey, commander of the Eighth Air> Force District at Fort Worth, was alerted by a phone call from Lieutenant> General Hoyt Vandenberg, Deputy Chief of the Air Force, that pieces of the> object were on the Roswell Air Base…. General Ramey at once called Colonel> Blanchard and made known his extreme displeasure as well as that of General> Vandenberg for Blanchard’s having initiated the press release. He then> directed that the Roswell portion of the wreckage be immediately loaded aboard> a B-29. With two generals “breathing down his neck,” Colonel Blanchard lost no> time in ordering Major Marcel personally to fly this material to the general’s> headquarters at Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, for his> examination before flying it on to Wright-Patterson Field in Dayton, Ohio,> where it would undergo the “further analysis” prescribed for it by General> Vandenburg himself.> Ramey then went on the air on a hook-up hastily patched out of a Fort Worth> radio station to nervously assure the public that the crashed “fl-fly-flying> disc” was really nothing more than the remains of a downed weather balloon,> and that the whole thing was due only to a case of mistaken identity. “There> is no such gadget (as a flying disc) known to the Army,” he said somberly, and> then hastily added the qualification, “at least not at this level.”16 In other words, within hours, the U.S. Army Air Force had changed its story frombeing one of a crashed “flying saucer” to a crashed “weather balloon” which wasmistaken for the former!However, note the new assertion in Berlitz’s and Moore’s presentation, for nowColonel Blanchard is being viewed as the ultimate source for the press releaseissued by Lieutenant Haut, and this presents us with the same difficulties asbefore, only writ larger, for would Colonel Blanchard, commander of the world’sonly atomic bomb group, be likely to have issued such a release, implicit withall its national security implications, and with Soviet spies prowling NewMexico, without prior authorization from higher headquarters?Unlikely.In other words, what we are now dealing with is a highly obfuscated story, withtwo layers of disinformation likely operating, a deep layer, the “flying saucer”layer, and the shallower layer, the “crashed and mistaken balloon” layer.However, the “balloon story” seems ridiculous on the face of it, for regardlessof what type of balloon may have been involved, is it likely that the Eighth AirForce would have gone to the trouble to ship its wreckage to Wright-PattersonField for “further examination”?Also unlikely.For Berlitz and Moore, the improbability of the balloon explanation was quicklydissolved by the testimony of General Ramey’s former adjutant, Colonel ThomasJefferson DuBose. Thirty-two years after the event, DuBose finally lifted theveil of secrecy on part of the incident by revealing to Berlitz and Moore that“orders from on high” had been received> “to ship the material from Roswell directly to Wright Field by special plane.”> He added that the general (Ramey) was in complete charge and the rest of the> officers and men involved “just followed orders.”The general was most> concerned that the large number of press reporters present be “taken off his> back in a hurry.”The weather balloon story was a fabrication designed to> accomplish that task and “put out the fire” at the same time. He did not> recall who first suggested the weather-balloon explanation, but thinks it may> have been Ramey himself.17 In other words it is likely that, at the minimum, it was General Ramey drivingand orchestrating the recovery and the various stories released to the press,and more likely that such instructions came from even higher up, in thePentagon, with Lt. General Hoyt Vandenberg himself.4. MAJOR JESSE MARCEL IS ORDERED TO FORT WORTH WITH THE WRECKAGE From this point, the plot, and its difficulties, considerably thicken, forWarrant Officer Irving Newton, working in the weather office at Carswell Fieldon July 8, 1947, stated in July of 1979 that when he was brought into GeneralRamey’s office and shown the debris from the Roswell crash, that there was “nodoubt that what I was given were parts of a balloon.”18 But Newton also addedsomething intriguing: “I was later told that the major19 from Roswell hadidentified the stuff as a flying saucer but that the general had been suspiciousof this identification from the beginning and that’s why I had been called.”20But this raises new questions.The major that Warrant Officer Newton was referring to was none other than the509th’s base intelligence officer, Major Jesse Marcel. So in effect, what theU.S. Army Air Force with its weather balloon story was now asking people tobelieve was that the intelligence officer of the world’s only atomic bomb groupcould not tell the difference between the wreckage from a weather balloon andthat from a flying saucer!So a closer look at Marcel, the crash site, and the debris, is now in order, forthese — Marcel, the debris field, and the debris itself — are the centralcharacters in the Roswell scenario with which any interpretation, be it that ofcrashed extra-terrestrial flying saucers, or that of crashed balloons, mustcontend.5. WEATHER BALLOON DEBRIS IS SUBSTITUTED AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE: MAJOR JESSEMARCEL AND THE DEBRISA. MARCEL’S CURRICULUM VITAE, ACCORDING TO BERLITZ AND MOORE As Berlitz and Moore themselves observe, “perhaps some of the most importanttestimony in the matter of the crashed disc comes from Major (now LieutenantColonel) Jesse A. Marcel, ranking staff officer in charge of intelligence at theRoswell Army Air Base at the time of the incident.”21 Indeed, other than rancherMac Brazel, on whose ranch the debris and wreckage was allegedly found, Marcelmay reasonably be seen to be the fundamental and central witness to the wholeincident and to its more-than-mundane significance.According to Berlitz and Moore, Marcel enlisted in the Army Air Force followingthe Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and due to his familiarity with aerial mapsand cartography, was sent to intelligence school. Marcel proved “to be such acapable student that, upon completion of training, he was retained as aninstructor.”22 After serving as an intelligence officer for a bomber squadron inNew Guinea, “he logged 468 hours of combat flying in B-24s, was awarded five airmedals for shooting down five enemy aircraft, and was himself shot down once (onhis third mission).”23 By the end of the war, Marcel was selected to become amember of the 509th Bomb Wing, “one of the few ‘elite’ groups in the U.S.military, where all officers and enlisted men were literally hand-picked fortheir jobs and required high security clearances.”24 In that capacity Marcelplayed a major role in security for Operation Crossroads, the atom-bomb tests atKwajalein atoll in 1946.25image [images/00011.jpg] Major Jesse A. Marcel, Sr., ca. 1947 B. THE MOORE-FRIEDMAN-MARCEL INTERVIEWS OF MAY AND DECEMBER, 1979 Stanton T. Friedman and William Moore conducted interviews with Marcel in Mayand December of 1979, and it is these interviews from which the descriptions ofthe Roswell debris ultimately stem. Additionally, with Marcel’s testimony, thecurious lack of details in the Army Air Force’s original story, as offered inthe press release of Lt. Walter Haut, are now fleshed out. I will present themain core of these interviews in their entirety, and then analyze theirimplications following each major section.> Question:> Major Marcel, did you personally see a crashed UFO?> I saw a lot of wreckage but no complete machine. Whatever it was had to have> exploded in the air above the ground level. It had disintegrated before it hit> the ground. The wreckage was scattered over an area of about three quarters of> a mile long and several hundred feet wide. > How did the Roswell Base know about the crash at Brazel’s ranch?> We heard about it on July 7 when we got a call from the county sheriff’s> office at Roswell. I was eating lunch at the officers’ club when the call came> through saying that I should go out and talk to Brazel. The sheriff said that> Brazel had told him that something had exploded over Brazel’s ranch and that> there was a lot of debris scattered around.> I finished my lunch and went into town to talk to this fellow. When I had> heard what he had to say, I decided that this was a matter that had better be> brought to the attention of (Colonel Blanchard) right away and let him decide> what ought to be done….> In my discussion with the colonel, we determined that a downed aircraft of> some unusual sort might be involved, so the colonel said I had better get out> there, and to take whatever I needed and go. I and a CIC (Counter-Intelligence> Corps) agent from West Texas by the name of Cavitt…followed this man out to> his ranch, with me driving my staff car (a ‘42 Buick) and Cavitt in a Jeep> Carry-all.> …. > It seems to me that Brazel told me that he thought he had heard an odd> explosion late in the evening several days earlier during an electrical storm,> but paid no special attention to it at the time because he had attributed it> to just a freak part of the storm. He didn’t find the wreckage until the next> morning.> On Saturday, July 5, 1947, Brazel went into town — Corona. While he was there> he heard stories about flying saucers having been seen all over the area. He> began to think that’s what had come down on his ranch, but I don’t know> whether he said anything about it to anyone at the time.> On Sunday, July 6, Brazel decided he had better go into town and report this> to someone. When he got there, he went to Chaves County sheriff’s office and> told the story to the sheriff. It was the sheriff, George Wilcox, who called> me at the base. I was eating lunch at the time and had just sat down when the> phone rang. > Do you think that what you saw was a weather balloon?> It was not. I was pretty well acquainted with most everything that was in the> air at that time, both ours and foreign. I was also acquainted with virtually> every type of weather-observation or radar tracking device being used by> either the civilians or the military. It was definitely not a weather or> tracking device, nor was it any sort of plane or missile. What it was we> didn’t know. We just picked up the fragments. It was something I had never> seen before, or since, for that matter. I didn’t know what it was, but it> certainly wasn’t anything built by us, and it most certainly wasn’t any> weather balloon. > Can you describe the materials that you found on the site?> There was (sic) all kinds of stuff — small beams about three eighths or half> inch square with some sort of odd hieroglyphics on them that nobody could> decipher. These looked something like balsa wood, and were of about the same> weight, except that they were not wood at all. They were very hard, although> flexible, and would not burn. There was a great deal of an unusual> parchment-like substance which was brown in color and extremely strong, and a> great number of small pieces of a metal like tinfoil, except that it wasn’t> tinfoil. I was interested in electronics and kept looking for something that> resembled instruments or electronic equipment, but I didn’t find anything. One> of the other fellows, Cavitt, I think, found a black metallic-looking box> several inches square. As there was no apparent way to open this, and since it> didn’t appear to be an instrument package of any sort (it too was very> lightweight), we threw it in with the rest of the stuff. I don’t know what> eventually happened to the box, but it went along with the rest of the> material we eventually took to Fort Worth. > What was especially interesting about the material?> One thing that impressed me about the debris was the fact that a lot of it> looked like parchment. It had little numbers with symbols that we had to call> hieroglyphics because I could not understand them. They could not be read,> they were just like symbols, something that meant something, and they were not> all the same, but the same general pattern, I would say. They were pink and> purple. They looked like they were painted on. These little numbers could not> be broken, could not be burned. I even took my cigarette lighter and tried to> burn the material we found that resembled parchment and balsa, but it would> not burn — wouldn’t even smoke. But something that is even more astounding is> that the pieces of metal that we brought back were so thin, just like the> tinfoil in a pack of cigarettes. I didn’t pay too much attention to that at> first, until one of the boys came to me and said: “You know that metal that> was in there? I tried to bend the stuff and it won’t bend. I even tried it> with a sledgehammer. You can’t make a dent on it.”… This particular piece of> metal was about two feet long and maybe a foot wide. It was so light it> weighed practically nothing… it was so thin. So I tried to bend the stuff. We> did all we could to bend it. It would not bend and you could not tear it or> cut it either. We even tried making a dent in it with a sixteen-pound> sledgehammer, and there was still no dent in it…. It’s a mystery to me what> the whole thing was…. It was possible to flex this stuff back and forth, even> to wrinkle it, but you could not put a crease in it that would stay, nor could> you dent it at all. I would almost have to describe it as a metal with plastic> properties. One of the fellows tried to put some of the pieces together — like> a jigsaw puzzle. He managed to get about ten square feet together, but it> wasn’t enough to get any idea of the general shape of the object itself.> Whatever it was, it was big.26 Before proceeding with the rest of Major Marcel’s interview with Moore andFriedman, it is worth pausing to take stock of what Marcel has asserted, and itsimplications vis-à-vis the story as recounted in the Roswell Daily Record aswell as for the wider “ET standard scenario.”There are three major themes in this section of the interview. The first is thetimeline itself, for as elaborated and recounted by Marcel, at some time priorto the phone call from Sheriff Wilcox to Major Marcel on July 7th, rancher MacBrazel had heard an unusual explosion during an electrical storm, and brought itto the attention of the sheriff. This brings into view the second major theme ofthe interview, namely, that Marcel, based on his meeting with Brazel at thesheriff’s office, decided immediately to bring it to the attention of basecommander Colonel Blanchard. Both men came to the conclusion that, far frombeing a flying saucer, it was, in Marcel’s own words, a crashed “aircraft of(an) unusual sort,” implying that they suspected it was something exotic fromsome black project. Blanchard was therefore involved with the debris recoveryprior to Lt. Haut’s press release, making it extremely unlikely that Haut issuedit on his own authority, but directly on orders from Blanchard. Thus, inprivate, Marcel and Blanchard are initially under the impression it is some kindof unusual aircraft, and publicly, Haut is talking of flying saucers.But the third theme is the debris itself, and here each point must be consideredmore closely and carefully.First and foremost, it is to be noted that, in this interview, Major Marcel thusfar gave no indication or suspicion that the debris was of extraterrestrialorigin. Similarly, Marcel makes no mention of the presence or recovery of anybodies at Brazel’s ranch. In a certain sense, and from the logical standpointfor the “ET” interpretation of Roswell, Marcel’s initial testimony, by notmentioning “ET” at all — either in the form of cadavers or in connection withthe debris — required the discovery or the addition of a second site which couldprovide these details.But what of the characteristics of the debris itself?Here, remarkably, both the Roswell “ET” community and the Roswell skeptics’community miss a significant statement Marcel makes. It is easily discerniblewhen the properties of the debris are enumerated and catalogued, for there arefour types of debris mentioned by Marcel:> 1) Beams made of a material like balsa-wood. This material is> a) flexible, but not breakable; and,> b) has symbols on it which Marcel describes as being like “hieroglyphics;”> 2) A “black box” several inches square, which is too light in Marcel’s opinion> to contain instrumentation;> 3) Parchment-like material, with> a) numbers along with “symbols like hieroglyphics;” which in turn,> b) could not be broken or burned, inasmuch as Marcel indicates that he> attempted — for reasons he does not state — to burn the material with his> cigarette lighter;> 4) Tinfoil-like material, no thicker than the tinfoil in a pack of cigarettes,> that is,> a) not bendable;> b) not dentable, even with a sledgehammer;> c) not able to be cut or torn; and finally,> d) is flexible to the extent that one can wrinkle it, but not crease it. This> is the beginning of the “memory metal” aspect of the Roswell debris. Note first of all, point 3) a), the presence of numbers in the otherwiseundecipherable “hieroglyphics,” for at this stage of the ever-evolving Roswellstory, these numbers hover as the only recognizable component in a context ofotherwise mystifying debris, and if Marcel is to be taken literally and at hisword here, the presence of recognizable numbers means that whatever the debriswas, in order for these numbers to be recognized as numbers by Marcel, then theyhad to be our standard adaptation of Arabic or Roman numerals, and hence thereis a wholly terrestrial context for the debris no matter how exotic its otherproperties. Of course, Marcel, as we shall see, would later elaborate his storyto exclude this interpretive analysis, but in any case, the fact that it occursin his earliest recounting of the debris in my opinion is significant, and callsfor an attempt to explain the other debris properties along the lines ofterrestrial technology, an attempt that we shall make in Part Three. It isinteresting to observe that — to my knowledge — neither the Roswell “ET”community nor the Roswell skeptics’ community has noticed this point and itspossible significance. “ET” is not likely to have used any system of symbolicnumerals recognizable to Marcel, whether Arabic or Roman.Another significant feature of Marcel’s descriptions of the debris must benoted, and that is the apparent contradiction involved in his description of the“tinfoil,” for as points 4) a) through d) above attest, this material couldneither be bent nor dented nor cut nor torn, and yet it was capable of beingwrinkled without a crease. While some might take this as purest fancy, acontradiction indicative of a fabrication on Marcel’s part, such a blatantlycontradictory catalogue of datasets would seem to be too obvious for someone ofMarcel’s intelligence. There are two other explanations that might make sense:either Marcel is talking about two different types of tinfoil, or field testswere initially performed at the recovery site, and more extensive tests wereperformed later at Roswell Army Air Field.Finally, it is to be noted, once again, that Marcel does not describe a “wholemachine,” but only fragments, in distinction from the Roswell Daily Record’sinsistence that a more or less intact disc was recovered.It is now necessary to return to Marcel’s initial interview with Friedman andMoore:> What did you do with the material you had picked up?> We collected all the debris we could handle. When we had filled the Carry-all,> I began to fill the trunk and back seat of the Buick. That afternoon (July 7)> we headed back to Roswell and arrived there in the early evening.> When we arrived there, we discovered that the story we had found a flying disc> had already leaked out ahead of us. We had an eager-beaver (public information> officer) on the base who had taken it upon himself to call the (Associated> Press) on this thing. We had several calls that night, and one reporter even> came to the house, but of course I couldn’t confirm anything to them over the> phone, and the man who came to the house my wife sent over to see the colonel.> The next morning that written press release went out, and after that things> really hit the fan. The phone rang right off the hook. I heard that the brass> fried him later on for putting out that press release, but then I can’t say so> for sure.> Anyway, the next afternoon we loaded everything into a B-29 on orders from> Colonel Blanchard and flew it all to Fort Worth. I was scheduled to fly it all> the way to Wright Field in Ohio, but when we got to Carswell at Fort Worth,> the general nixed it. He took control at this point, told the press it was all> a weather balloon, and ordered me not to talk to the press under any> circumstances. I was pulled off the flight and someone else was assigned to> fly the stuff up to Wright…Field. Everything was sent to Wright-Patterson for> analysis.27Note what we have at this juncture. First, Marcel once again proffers the ideathat Lt. Haut’s press release was published under his own initiative, apart fromany involvement of the base commander, Colonel Blanchard. But more importantly,Marcel makes no mention, again, of the recovery of an entire craft, much lessits being flown to Fort Worth, an impossibility in any case, since such a craftwould not likely have fit into the fuselage of a B-29 Superfortress. It mostlikely would have been transported overland. And note, that Marcel and theRoswell Daily Record are now in conflict, for the Record states explicitly thatthe release came from the intelligence office of the base, that is to say, fromMarcel’s office.Finally, Marcel now states that the ultimate destination was Wright-Pattersonairbase north of Dayton, Ohio. A significant question occurs at this point: whywas the debris taken there? Why, with such apparently exotic properties, was itnot taken to a much more secret facility such as Los Alamos or any of the othernearby secret facilities in New Mexico? Was there something specifically aboutWright Field — beyond its being the home of the Air Material Command and the AirTechnical Intelligence Command - that made it a more logical choice? There is.It was home to a contingent of Nazi aerodynamics engineers.Resuming with Marcel’s interview:> Just after we got to Carswell, Fort Worth, we were told to bring some of this> stuff up to the general’s office — that he wanted to look at it. We did this> and spread it out on the floor on some brown paper.> What we had was only a very small portion of the debris — there was a whole> lot more. There was half a B-29-ful outside. General Ramey allowed some> members of the press in to take pictures of this stuff. They took one picture> of me on the floor holding up some of the less-interesting metallic debris….> The stuff in that one photo was pieces of the actual stuff we had found. It> was not a staged photo. Later, they cleared out our wreckage and substituted> some of their own. Then they allowed more photos. Those photos were taken> while the actual wreckage was already on its way to Wright Field. I was not in> these. I believe these were taken with the general and one of his aides. I’ve> seen a lot of weather balloons, but I’ve never seen one like that before. And> I don’t think they ever did either.> ….> So what you’re saying is that this whole weather-balloon thing was nothing but> a cover-up?> Well, one thing that I want to point out is that the newsmen saw very little> of the material — and none of the important things that had hieroglyphics, or> markings, on them. They didn’t see that because it wasn’t there. They wanted> me to tell them about it but I couldn’t say anything. When the general came in> he told me not to say anything, that he would handle it. He told the newsman:> “Yes, that’s the weather balloon.”So the newsmen had to take his word for it> because they had nothing else to go by. They tried to get me to talk about it,> but the general had told me not to say anything and I couldn’t say anything.> That’s when the general told me: “It’s best you go back to Roswell. You have> duties to perform there. We’ll handle it from here…”28 Marcel is of course referring to the now famous photograph of General Ramey withhis adjutant, then Colonel Thomas DuBose, holding pieces of the substituteddebris of an actual crashed weather balloon.image [images/00012.jpg] Brigadier General Ramey on the left, and his adjutant, ColonelDuBose, sitting inthe chair on the right, with the substituted weather balloon debris. The reader will note that General Ramey holds a slightly folded and crumpledpiece of paper in his left hand. With the recent advancements of computerenhancement technology and pixel analysis, some Roswell researchers haveundertaken to attempt to decipher what that paper actually says, a point whichwill be taken up in a later chapter.6. THE PARADE OF WITNESSES BEGINS Major Marcel’s story is, from the point of view of the “conventional wisdom” ofthe Roswell crash, rather ordinary by comparison, for in it, one encounters veryfew genuinely sensational elements, other than the unusual and exotic propertiesof the debris itself; there are no bug-eyed gray aliens, no autopsies, not even,as we have seen, any real saucer nor, in his initial recounting of the debris,are there even any claims as to the nature — extraterrestrial or otherwise — ofits origins. All that Major Marcel did say was that he hadn’t seen “anythinglike it.”However, the Roswell Daily Record clearly stated that the U.S. Army Air Forcehad recovered “a disc,” a singular machine, and that fact, plus Marcel’s owndescription of the debris field, if taken together and at their literal word,implied that there had to be a second site, the primary site, and this indeed iswhere the “standard scenario” of a crashed and recovered extraterrestrialvehicle and bodies takes its origin.As Berlitz and Moore, and their investigator Stanton Friedman, continued toinvestigate, a number of clues began to become evident to them. For example, OnJuly 5, 1947, there was an actual weather balloon crash in Ohio on the farm ofSherman Cambpbell. This, they note, may have actually been the inspiration forthe weather balloon story put out by General Ramey’s headquarters in FortWorth.29 And the significance of a comparison of the two incidents was not lostupon them, for they quip that the balloon was immediately identified as aweather balloon “by the military without the necessity of first sending it on to‘higher headquarters.’”30> One is compelled to admire the tactics of the headquarters in question as a> way of defusing public interest in — or even panic caused by — the incident.> If, for example, a blanket denial had been made, it would probably have served> only to increase curiosity, but a human admission of a case of mistaken> identity, even on the part of the Air Force, induced a certain sympathetic> understanding and, more important, deflated the mystery of the incident as> surely as letting out the helium would deflate a real weather balloon.31But while the military was busily deflating the significance of the incident,not all reporters were willing to be put off the scent so readily.A. COLONEL BLANCHARD’S WIDOW On the very day that Haut’s press release went out and the Roswell Daily Recordpublished its article about the military’s recovery of a flying disc, the verysame day that Major Marcel flew with the debris to Carswell Air Field in FortWorth, the Roswell base commander, Colonel William Blanchard “suddenly andconveniently went on leave.”32 Just where he went on leave to will be seensubsequently as the standard scenario is fleshed out.Whatever “mistakes” Blanchard may have made in his handling of the incidentapparently were not significant enough to prevent him from attaining later inlife the rank of general, and being one of the senior general officers in theU.S. Air Force’s operations and planning staff.33 And Blanchard, who came withina hair’s breath of being the pilot chosen to drop America’s first atomic bombson Japan, certainly would have known the difference between a weather balloonand something more exotic.34> Although General Blanchard is now dead, his widow recently confirmed> (interview with Stanton Friedman) that her husband knew that the wreckage that> he had sent to Carswell did not belong to any balloon. “He knew it was nothing> made by us,” she said, noting that “At first he thought it might be Russian> because of the strange symbols on it. Later on, he realized it wasn’t Russian> either.”35Blanchard’s widow’s statement is intriguing, not for what it says, but for whatit does not say, for she does not indicate that Blanchard thought it wasextra-terrestrial. Indeed, as her remarks indicate, he was inclined initially tothink it was Russian, i.e., of terrestrial origin, but later concluded it wasnot Russian. Not being “Russian” however does not make it perforceextraterrestrial, for there are terrestrial possibilities that remain to beexamined.B. GRADY BARNETT AND THE SECOND SITE: BODIES ARE FINALLY FOUND So where was the second site? Where and when, and by whom, did the“extraterrestrial bodies” come into play?That “testimony” came initially from one Grady “Barney” Barnett. Barnett was aresident of the town of Socorro, New Mexico, and an engineer specializing insoil conservation working for the federal government. Barnett and his wife Ruthbecame close friends with Vern and Jean Maltais.36 But this is not why Barnett’sstatements must be qualified as “testimony.” The reason for the qualification isspelled out by Berlitz and Moore themselves, for Barnett> Was one of the first witnesses to arrive at the site of the fallen saucer,> sometime in the morning of July 3, 1947.> ….> In February m1950, during a visit by the Maltaises to Socorro, Barnett told> his friends an extraordinary story. Before telling them, however, he cautioned> them not to repeat it. Barnett claimed to have personally witnessed a> flying-saucer crash in the Socorro area — that he had seen it and seen dead> bodies that were not human beings. The area was quickly sealed off and the> bodies and wreckage removed by the military.> Although three decades have passed since Barnett told his strange tale to the> Maltaises, they remember it very well…37Therewith one confronts the problem of Barnett’s testimony concerning deadextra-terrestrials at the Roswell Incident, for the story is told (1) decadesafter the event, and (2) told by second-hand sources.According to the Maltaises, there were five principal elements to Barnett’sstory:> 1) Barnett claimed to have spotted a “large metallic object” that caught his> eye in the distance as he was “working near Magdalena, New Mexico.” Deciding> to investigate, Barnett came upon “some sort of metallic, disc-shaped object> about twenty-five or thirty feet across.” The metal of the object “looked like> dirty stainless steel.”38 Note that if Barnett’s story is true, he is the> first witness actually to have seen the intact craft itself, and not merely a> debris field as recounted by Major Marcel.> 2) Barnett also claimed that within mere minutes of having come across the> craft, that other people approached it from the opposite direction. The people> claimed to be a team of archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania.39> 3) Barnett then noticed the archaeological team standing around “looking at> some dead bodies” which were “inside and outside the vehicle.” Barnett then> gave the Maltaises the first real description of the Roswell> “extra-terrestrials”, for “they were like humans but they were not humans. The> heads were round, the eyes were small, and they had no hair. The eyes were> oddly spaced. They were quite small by our standards and their heads were> larger in proportion to their bodies than ours.”40> 4) Within minutes, as Barnett and the archaeological team were looking at the> bodies, the military arrived in a truck, and an officer took control of the> site for the Army.41> 5) Finally, Barnett told the Maltaises that the military ordered everyone away> from the site, and ordered them not to talk about what they had seen, and that> to do so “would be unpatriotic.”42Barnett also told the Maltaises that the> object was moved away from the site, presumably on a large truck brought in> for the purpose, but we do not learn from the Maltaises how Barnett knew this> after having presumably been ordered off the site by the military.43 Barnett’s story is significant in three respects. Firstly, it supplied theneeded “second site,” with the needed “intact craft,” that the logic of thestory, as a comparison of Major Marcel’s evidence, and the original RoswellDaily Record article of July 8, 1947, demanded.44 Secondly, it also indicatedthat there was a second recovery, retrieval, and shipment operation inconnection with that site, in addition to that at the Brazel debris fieldrecounted by Major Marcel. Finally, Barnett’s story gives the first real,detailed description of the alleged “extra-terrestrial” bodies:> 1) They were like humans but not humans;> 2) They were bald;> 3) They had small eyes that were widely spaced;> 4) They were of shorter stature than humans; and finally,> 5) Their heads were disproportionally larger than their bodies. But as will be seen in Part Three, there is nothing distinctively andconclusively “extraterrestrial” about this catalogue. In fact, as willeventually be demonstrated, this list points rather distinctively andconclusively to something very terrestrial, and yet, anomalous enough that alayman might very easily be led to assume that it represented something fromanother planet.C. MAC BRAZEL’S SON, BILL BRAZEL: NEW SCENARIO DETAILS, AND THE DEBRIS AGAIN While the rancher who had originally discovered the now famous “debris field,”Mac Brazel, was dead before Berlitz, Moore, and Friedman began the research forThe Roswell Incident, his son Bill Brazel was still alive, and consequently,co-author William Moore interviewed him in March, June, and December of 1979.45In the story that he recounted for Moore, Bill Brazel added several new detailsto the story. First, the younger Brazel maintained that his father told his partin the story only reluctantly, and in bits and pieces, taking the greater partof what he knew to the grave with him. Brazel also indicated that sometime afterhe had contacted Chaves County Sheriff George Wilcox, and sometime after hisinitial contact with Major Marcel and the initial trip to his ranch to recoverthe debris, that the military had been kept incommunicado by Army. Brazelrecalled his father stating “Gosh…I just tried to do a good deed and they put mein jail for it,” adding that his father had been shut up in a room and notallowed out.46image [images/00013.jpg] Rancher Mac Brazel in July, 1947 Other new details emerged in the younger Brazel’s story. For example, while Macwas being held by the military, he was given a complete “head-to-foot armyphysical’ before they would let him come home.”47 Another detail concerned Mac’sactual finding of the debris field itself. According to the younger Brazel, hisfather was sitting in the ranch house with two hired hands during a terribleelectrical storm. His father commented on how strange it was that the lightningseemed to strike the same place, time after time. During the storm, he heard “anodd sort of explosion, not like ordinary thunder, but different.”48 The nextmorning, Brazel related, his father came across the debris field, extendingabout a quarter of a mile, and several hundred feet wide, in a southwesterlydirection.49Additionally, Bill Brazel claimed that he had also found, and kept some of thedebris himself for a while.50 The younger Brazel’s description of the debris isworth citing, since it provides close corroboration of the descriptions given byMajor Marcel:> There were several different types of stuff. Of course, all I had was small> bits and pieces, but one thing that I can say about it was that it sure was> light in weight. It weighed almost nothing. There was some wooden-like> particles I picked up. These were like balsa wood in weight, but a bit darker> in color and much harder. You know the thing about wood is that the harder it> gets, the heavier it is. Mahogany, for example, is quite heavy. This stuff, on> the other hand, weighed nothing, yet you couldn’t scratch it with your> fingernail like ordinary balsa, and you couldn’t break it either. It was> pliable, but wouldn’t break. Of course, all I had was a few splinters. It> never occurred to me to try to burn it so I don’t know if it would burn or> not.> There were also several bits of a metal-like substance, something on the order> of tinfoil except that this stuff wouldn’t tear and was actually a bit darker> in color than tinfoil — more like lead foil, except very thin and extremely> lightweight. The odd thing about this foil was that you could wrinkle it and> lat it back down and it immediately resumed its original shape. It was quite> pliable, yet you couldn’t crease or bend it like ordinary metal. It was almost> more like a plastic of some sort, except that it was definitely metallic in> nature. I don’t know what it was, but I do know that Dad once said the Army> had told him that they had definitely established it was not anything made by> us.> Then there was some thread-like material. It looked like silk and there were> several pieces of it. It was not large enough to call it string, but yet not> so small as sewing thread either. To all appearances it was silk, except that> it wasn’t silk. Whatever it was, it too was a very strong material. You could> take it in two hands and try to snap it, but it wouldn’t snap at all. Nor did> it have strands or other fibers like silk thread would have. This was more> like a wire — all one piece or substance. In fact, I suppose it could have> been a sort of wire — that thought never occurred to me before.> ….> Was there any writing or markings on any of the material you had? > No, not on what I had. But Dad did say one time that there were what he called> “figures” on some of the pieces he found. He often referred to the petroglyphs> the ancient Indians drew on rocks around here as “figures” too, and I think> that’s what he meant to compare them with.51According to the younger Brazel, the Army eventually learned about his privatecache of Roswell debris, and confiscated it.52It is interesting to note that Bill Brazel’s account of the debris closelyparallels Major Marcel’s in almost all respects, save two. Firstly, Bill Brazelgives more explicit details concerning the “memory metal” than does MajorMarcel. Secondly, Brazel observes that his father described the “hieroglyphics”on the debris as being similar in nature to the American Indian petroglyphs thatare found on stones throughout the American southwest. This, as we shall see, isan important clue into the possible physics of the technology involved.Finally, Bill Brazel observes that his father never mentioned any bodies orcreatures connected with the wreckage.53Bill Brazel’s sister and Mac Brazel’s daughter, Bessie Brazel Schreiber, in aJuly 1979 interview, described the writing on metal-foil pieces as existing on akind of “tape” which if held up to the light “showed what looked like pastelflowers or designs.”54 Brazel’s daughter also gives an additional insight intothe “numbers” mentioned by Marcel: “They were written out like you would writenumbers in a column to do an addition problem. But they didn’t look like thenumbers we use at all.”55 For the older intelligence officer Marcel, they weresimple “numbers,” and no additional qualifications were given. To the youngerBrazel, who was only twelve years old at the time,56 the “numbers” were notreally numbers at all. She simple assumed them to be such because of thecolumnar arrangement.D. FLOYD PROCTOR INTERVIEW: MORE CHRONOLOGICAL DETAILS EMERGE Mac Brazel’s neighbor, Floyd Proctor, lived about eight miles from Brazel’sranch, and it was indeed one of his children who had been one of the hired handswith Mac Brazel the night of the terrible electrical storm. Proctor wasinterviewed by William Moore in June of 1979.57 According to Proctor, Brazelfirst came to him talking about the debris, describing “designs on it thatreminded him of Chinese and Japanese designs….like the kind of stuff you wouldfind on firecracker wrappers…”58 Proctor also indicated that the Army haddetained Mac under guard for approximately a week.59Proctor’s wife also corroborated her husband’s recollection saying that “Macsaid (the writing) was like the kind of stuff you find all over Japanese orChinese firecrackers; not really writing, just wiggles and such.”60 However,from this very terrestrial analogy, Berlitz and Moore gallop to some veryextraterrestrial conclusions, stating that “the unusual pictorial figures on theremnants of the foil…if part of a UFO, would be our first glimpse ofextraterrestrial writing…”61 Again, the terrestrial clues are ignored in favorof a paradigm of the extraterrestrial faith.E. THE TIMING OF MAC BRAZEL’S RADIO INTERVIEW At some juncture, according to the standard scenario, rancher Mac Brazel gave arecorded interview for radio station KGFL of Roswell, on an old wire recorder.The question is, when?> He was allegedly interviewed at the time of the incident one a wire recorder> by W.E. Whitmore, then owner of KGFL, who planned to use the information as a> “scoop” on the Mutual wire. W.E. Whitmore is now dead, but his son, Walt> Whitmore, Jr., remembers that his father hid Brazel at the Whitmore home to> keep the interview exclusive. At the very moment of the interview the Army,> according to Whitmore, was “having a fit” because they could not locate the> “rancher who had found the flying saucer.”62However, at this juncture, Whitmore Sr. began to broadcast preliminary detailson his radio station, only to be interrupted by a long distance person-to-personphone call from someone alleging to be the secretary of the FederalCommunications Commission, who ordered Whitmore to cease broadcasting the story,and threatening him with revocation of his station’s broadcasting license if hedid not.63And what of the initial press release itself? We have seen that Major Marcelbelieved that Lieutenant Haut issued the release in a fit of enthusiasm and onhis own authority, without prior consultation with Roswell Army Air Field basecommander, Colonel William Blanchard. Yet, the Roswell Daily Record article ofJuly 8, 1947 clearly and explicitly stated that the information came from thebase’s intelligence office, i.e., was somehow directly connected to Marcel, andthus, to Colonel Blanchard.Haut himself, in interviews given in March and June of 1979,64 stated that hewas called by Blanchard himself “and directed to write and distribute a newsrelease to the effect that the (Army Air Force) had recovered the remains of acrashed flying disc.”65 As already argued, this makes much more rational senseof the situation and circumstances.F. JESSE MARCEL JR. ON THE DEBRIS AND HIS FATHER Major Marcel’s son, then a physician in Montana, weighed in with his ownrecollections of the debris found by his father. His initial statements toBerlitz and Moore are worth recording in the light of his later interviews:> Dad got a call to go out and investigate a downed aircraft or something like> that. He was gone a couple of days and returned with a van and a part of a car> filled with wreckage and debris.> The material was foil-like stuff, very thin, metallic-like but not metal, and> very tough. There was also some structural-like material too, beams and so on.> Also a quantity of black plastic material which looked organic in nature.> Dad returned toward evening. He was gone all one night and most of the next> day. He had a 1942 Buick and a Carry-all trailer, and both were loaded with> this material which was only a fraction of the total material.66Later, Dr. Marcel added some more detail:> In reference to the UFO incident of 1947 or 1948 I omitted one startling> description of the wreckage for fear it might have been the fanciful> imagination of a twelve-year-old. Imprinted along the edge of some of the beam> remnants there were hieroglyphic-type characters. I recently questioned my> father about this, and he recalled seeing these characters also, and even> described them as being a pink or purplish-pink color. Egyptian hieroglyphics> would be a close visual description of the characters seen, except I don’t> think there were any animal figures present as there are in true Egyptian> hieroglyphics.67While Dr. Marcel’s comments substantially align with the recollections of thedebris that both his father, and Bill Brazel, made, what is notable in the lightof his later statements is that there is no mention of anything of anextraterrestrial nature.And that leaves the bodies, once again.7. ENTER THE EXTRATERRESTRIALS: A MORGUE FULL OF ETS, STRANGE INCIDENTS, ANDSTRANGER MEMORANDA Surprisingly, in a book purportedly trying its best to argue an extraterrestrialinterpretation for the Roswell Incident, other than Grady “Barney” Barnett’sstory, they produce no further direct evidence of the extraterrestrial nature ofthe recovered bodies. And as we have already seen, Barnett’s “testimony” notonly is not direct, but in that worst of a lawyer’s nightmares, was the secondhand testimony of a dead man via his friends, the Maltaises!What Berlitz and Moore do present is a wider anecdotal context in which to“interpret” Barnett’s story in a chapter entitled “Descriptions of the Aliens.”They begin with a memorandum of Meade Layne, deceased director of the BorderlandSciences Research Foundation, provided to them by his successor in thatorganization, Mr. Reilly Crabb:> Layne’s memo states that “on the basis of present information” he accepted the> facts of the story as authentic. Of his sources, he said that his “most direct> information involves three informants, two of whom are scientists of> distinction, and the third a business man of high standing.> “One of the scientists, a Dr. Weisberg, a physics professor from a California> university, saw the disc himself and took part in the examination of it. He> says the disc was shaped like a turtle’s back, with a cabin space some fifteen> feet in diameter. The bodies of six occupants were seared… and the interior of> the disc had been badly damaged by intense heat. One porthole had been> shattered….> “An autopsy on one body showed that it resembled a normal human body except in> size. One body was seated at what appeared to be a control desk, there were a> few ‘gadgets’ in front of him, and on the walls or panels were characters in> writing, in a language unknown to any of the investigators. They said it was> unlike anything known to them, and was definitely not Russian. There was no> propeller and no motor and they could not understand how it was driven or> controlled. It was considered possible that the disc was wrecked by the heat> of friction with the atmosphere….”> Dr. Weisberg’s other testimony is especially interesting in that he suggests> how the UFO got to its destination at Edwards Air Force Base. According to his> recollection, it was taken by truck to Magdalena, in Guadalupe County, where> it was put on a special car of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe (Railroad),> which had been brought down from Vaughn. It was “kept under wraps” passing> through Belen, Grants, and Gallup in New Mexico, Flagstaff, Arizona, to> Needles and Cadiz in California and finally to Muroc, where Camp Edwards is> located. > While we cannot be certain which material went to Fort Worth and which to> Muroc, apparently shipments in both directions took place: the disc and its> occupants to Muroc and the unusual wreckage to Fort Worth, and then on to> Wright Field in Ohio. There are even persistent rumors that, sometime in the> mid-1950s, presumably after an alleged viewing by President Eisenhower of the> material and bodies at Edwards, they were reunited under one roof inside a> structure referred to only as “Building 18-A, Area B” at Wright-Patterson Air> Force Base.68There are a number of points to notice here, not the least of which is thatthere is nothing conclusively compelling toward the conclusion that the bodiesare “extraterrestrial,” in fact, once again, quite the reverse, for the languagestates explicitly that an autopsy “showed that it resembled a normal human bodyexcept in size.” Presumably, an autopsy would have uncovered any anomalous orunusual interior physiology, yet, no mention is made of anything unusual exceptfor the size. The other point worth noticing is the only point that would tendtoward an extraterrestrial conclusion, for presumably the military would bringin a team of linguistics experts. This team could not identify the “writing” asany recognizable language. But what if the writing and the “hieroglyphs”represented something else entirely? That possibility will be examined in PartThree.Finally, it is worth noting that we encounter here, for the first time in awidely disseminated popular context and book, the idea that President Eisenhowerwent to Edwards Air Force Base to have an encounter with “ET,” in this case,dead ETs. This will assume some significance when we examine the EisenhowerBriefing Document in the Majic-12 documents in Part Two, for again, it will beWilliam Moore — self-confessed disinformation agent — who was one of theprinciples involved in the Eisenhower Briefing Document affair.But the bottom line is this: there is absolutely no detail in Dr. Weisberg’sallegations that compels to an extraterrestrial explanation either for the craftor the bodies. In fact, Weisberg’s descriptions of the latter are considerablyless detailed than Grady Barnett’s.Another source introduced into the wider contextual discussion ofextraterrestrials by Berlitz and Moore is Baron Nicholas von Poppen, aGerman-Estonian nobleman who had allegedly developed “a system of photographicmetallurgical analysis” and who worked in the Los Angeles area as “an industrialphotographer.”69 According to Berlitz and Moore, von Poppen was quoted bycelebrated ufologist Gray Barker in a May 1977 UFO Report as having been“employed by military authorities to photograph the damaged saucer,”70presumably the Roswell saucer. Assuming this to be the case for the sake ofargument, it is worth citing Berlitz and Moore’s summary and actual quotation ofvon Poppen extensively:> The salient points of von Poppen’s account are startling. On a certain> unspecified date in the late 19450s, he was visited by two military> intelligence representatives who offered him a top-secret photographic> assignment at an exceptionally high fee, but with the proviso that he would> immediately be deported if he revealed anything that he saw or photographed.> Subsequently the agents escorted him by plane to an air base which, he was> told, was Los Alamos (but which could have been Edwards since there was no air> base at Los Alamos). He was taken to a large object which resembled the> popular concept of a flying saucer. He stayed at the base for several days,> photographing the object, his film being taken from the camera by military> representatives as each film was completed. According to his recollection, he> took hundreds of pictures. In the close-up shots he was told that it was> important to show the texture of the metal.> Von Poppen thought that the machine was about thirty feet in diameter and the> interior cabin about twenty feet in diameter with a curving ceiling. Between> the inner cabin and the outside there was space for cables made of unfamiliar> metals or alloys. In this main cabin there were fur seats in front of a> control board, which was “covered with push buttons and tiny levers.” Plastic> sheets covered with symbols lay scattered on the control board and on the> floor.> Still strapped in each of the four seats was a dead body, extremely thin and> varying in height from about two to four feet… As quoted by Gray Barker, von> Poppen stated:> “The faces of all four were very white…. (They wore) shiny black attire,> one-piece outfits without pockets and closely gathered at their feet and> necks…. Their shoes… were made of the same material and appeared to be very> soft — not rigid…. Their hands were human-like though soft, like those of> children, complete with five digits, normal-looking joints, and neatly trimmed> nails….”71 Notably, the remains of the craft as described by von Poppen — assuming onceagain for the sake of argument that it is the Roswell craft — are remarkablydifferent than the technology later described in the MAJIC-12 documents, or, forthat matter, by Lt. Col. Philip Corso in his book The Day After Roswell, for invon Poppen’s account, one is dealing not with fiber optics connections but withordinary wires and cables, very terrestrial, and very 1940s, technologies. Moreimportantly, there once again is nothing on von Poppen’s account to compel tothe conclusion that the bodies described must originate off this planet.To put it succinctly, nothing in the detailed descriptions either of thetechnology or of the biology by von Poppen compels to an extraterrestrialconclusion. We are also left to assume that von Poppen’s account was intended toaddress the Roswell incident directly, which is likely. Nonetheless, theindirect nature of the account still means that Grady Barnett’s account is theonly account presented by Berlitz and Moore that “directly” alleges the recoveryof bodies, and even then, while the most detailed of the descriptions, as weshall see, even these details do not compel to an extra-terrestrial conclusion.A. THE NORMA GARDNER STORY Among the more interesting contextual stories that Berlitz and Moore adduce toround out the context of the Roswell Incident is the story of Mrs. NormaGardner. Gardner worked at Wright-Patterson airbase in 1955, and was givenspecial Top Secret security clearances for her post, which was to process allitems of paperwork connected with UFO debris cataloguing, and autopsiesallegedly performed on the recovered bodies from various UFO crashes.72Access to these autopsy reports gave Gardner an unusual insight into the detailsof the so-called “aliens.” Interestingly enough, once again the descriptions areoddly human, for they were described by her as being “between four and five feettall, with generally human-like features except that the heads were largerelative to the bodies and the eyes were slanted.”73But Gardner also adds a new detail that, as will be seen in Part Three, might behighly significant, for “among the more startling of the many rumors concerningthe crashed disc is the one that suggests that the object was brought down byair force action, perhaps accidentally, through radar interference with theoperational technology of the disc.”74 Berlitz and Moore add that they think itvery unlikely that the Roswell craft was brought down either by deliberate oraccidental American military action. “Far more likely is the conjecture that thedisc was struck by a lightning bolt, as seems to be indicated in Brazel’sstory.”75Clearly, Berlitz and Moore take Gardner’s recollection in the context of theRoswell incident, and this will become significant in Part Three, even thoughthis author concurs with their assessment that what most likely brought thecraft down was an accidental lightning strike.B. THE GOLDWATER-LEMAY INCIDENT The final intriguing incident recounted by Berlitz and Moore in their book isthe famous incident, told by the famous late U.S. Senator from Arizona, BarryGoldwater, himself a major general in the U.S. Air Force Reserve.> According to Senator Goldwater, what actually happened was the following:> while en route to California in the early 1960s, the senator stopped at> Wright-Patterson Air Base, where he visited his friend General Curtis LeMay.> Senator Goldwater had heard of the existence of a room or section on the base> referred to as “Blue Room,” where UFO artifacts, photographs, and exhibits> were kept. The senator, who, as a longtime pilot, had more than a passing> interest in UFOs, requested permission from General LeMay to visit the Blue> Room exhibits. General LeMay’s response was eminently succinct: “Hell, no. I> can’t go, you can’t go, and don’t ever ask me again!”76The question at this juncture — and one to which Berlitz and Moore themselvesare not oblivious — is who could be so powerful as to keep out a high rankinggeneral like LeMay, who by that time was a full four-star general, and incommand of the United States’ Air Forces’ entire nuclear warfare command, theStrategic Air Command?C. THE FBI AND TWINING-SCHULGEN MEMORANDA While the documentary evidence in Berlitz’s and Moore’s book is scanty, it isnonetheless highly significant, and seriously damaging to any “skeptics’” casethat the Roswell Incident represented the mere crash and mistaken identificationof a balloon. Among these is a secret FBI memorandum from director J. EdgarHoover to a “Mr. Ladd”, dated July 15, 1957. The memo is succinct, but huge withimplications:“Memorandum for Mr. Ladd > “Mr. (censored) also discussed this matter with Colonel L. R. Forney ofr MID> (Military Intelligence Division). Colonel Forney indicated that it was his> attitude that inasmuch as it has been established that the flying discs are> not the result of any Army or Navy experiments, the matter is of interest to> the FBI. He stated that he was of the opinion that the Bureau, if at all> possible, should accede to General Schulgen’s request (i.e., to aid the Army> Air Force in its investigations).> “SWR:AJB (Initials)” > Added to the bottom of the memo, in Hoover’s own handwriting, is: > “I would do it but before agreeing to it we must insist upon full access to> discs recovered. For instance in the (illegible: could be either “SW” or “LA”> case) the Army grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory> examination. > “H.”77 Note that, as far as Hoover’s FBI is concerned, it is a settled matter that thediscs do not represent any black project of the Army or Navy.Berlitz and Moore also observe that the abbreviations “SW” or “LA” could referto the southwest, or to Louisiana or Los Angeles.78 Berlitz and Moore argue thatthe Ladd memorandum refers in fact to the Roswell Incident because of a July 8,1947 teletype communication from the FBI’s Dallas Field Office to its CincinnatiField Office, “with copies to Hoover and the Strategic Air Command.”79 The text,as reproduced in their book, reads as follows:image [images/00014.jpg] image [images/00015.jpg] While the FBI teletype suggests that the Roswell Incident involved both aballoon and a disc, there is little doubt that a disc was somehow involved, andthat the weather balloon story put out by General Ramey in Fort Worth wasexactly that, a story.In this context, Berlitz and Moore introduce the Twining-Schulgen memorandum ofSeptember 23, 1947. As this memorandum will become important for the discussionsand argumentation in Parts Two and Three, it is reproduced here, and preliminaryconclusions are drawn from it.image [images/00016.jpg] > 1. As requested by AC/AS-2 tehre is presented below the considered opinion of> this Command concerning the so-called “Flying Discs.” This opinion is based on> interrogation report data furnished by AC/AS-2 and preliminary studies by> personnel of T—2 and Aircraft Laboratory, Engineering Division -3. This> opinion was arrived at in a conference between personnel from the Air> Institute of Technology, Intelligence T-2, Office Chief of Engineering> Division, and the Aircraft, Power Plant and Propeller Laboratories of> Engineering Division T-3.> 2. It is the opinion that:> a. The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.> b. There are objects probably approximately the shape of a disc, of such> appreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made aircraft.> c. There is a possibility that some of the incidents may be caused by natural> phenomenon (sic), such as meteors.> d. The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb,> maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which must be considered> evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief> to the possibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually,> automatically, or remotely.> e. The apparent common description of the objects is as follows:> (1) Metallic or light reflecting surface.> (2) Absence of trail, except in a few instances when the object was apparently> operating under high performance conditions.> (3) Circular or elliptical in shape, flat on bottom and domed on top.> (4) Several reports of well kept formation flights varying from three to nine> objects.> (5) Normally no associated sound, except in three instances a substantial> rumbling roar was noted…81 It is crucial to note that this memorandum was written after the flight of thedisc debris to Wright-Patterson, and after the FBI memoranda presented earlier,making it extremely liked that it reflects the preliminary opinion of GeneralTwining’s Air Material Command on what had been recovered.Yet, notice, that there is no mention of an extraterrestrial perspectivewhatsoever. Indeed, several of the technological aspects mentioned by thedocument would dispel such a perspective, and argue for a more terrestriallybased technology, including the document’s mention of a “trail” from suchobjects under high performance conditions, and a roaring sound, both morecharacteristic of some form of jet propulsion than of any advancedextra-terrestrial technology.Berlitz and Moore rightly note that “the fact that the memo accepts the realityof ‘flying discs’ are indicative of the official climate of urgency generated bythe Roswell incident.”82 However, an important clue as to the source and reasonfor that urgency is completely ignored by Berlitz and Moore (and for thatmatter, by most ufologists since the memorandum’s first appearance), and that isthat the memo specifically mentions that its opinion was based in part oninterrogations by the intelligence section of the Air Materials Command.Who is being interrogated here? Extraterrestrials - whose hieroglyphic“language” no one could understand, making it unlikely that in the few monthsbetween July and September of 1947 any other form of communication would havebeen deciphered — or someone else? If, as some would later allege, at least oneof the recovered Roswell crewmen was still alive, and if it can be shown thatthe physiological characteristics recorded for these aliens has a plausibleterrestrial explanation, then could this be the source of the intelligencegained by interrogation? But if so, once again, where on earth did it come from?Note also that the memorandum also strongly implies that some of the opinionreflected in the memorandum stems from actual technological analysis itself,some of which had already been presumably performed on the Roswell craft. And asalready indicated, some of this analysis is more characteristic of jet propelledaircraft in high performance modes, than of any advanced “extra-terrestrialfield propulsion” devices.So, if all this be the case, then why is there such a sense of urgency in themilitary, an urgency clearly noticed by Berlitz and Moore? Since Berlitz andMoore and several of their witnesses have already ruled out a Soviet source andcause for this urgency, what other terrestrial basis for it could there be?Of course, Berlitz and Moore are not interested in possible terrestrialexplanations, for having ruled out a Soviet source, they think they haveeliminated any other possible terrestrial source, and thus left theextraterrestrial interpretation holding the field by default. But, as has beenseen, by opting too early for this explanation, their analysis of crucial andsignificant details in the documents that they themselves present is altogetherdeficient and unpersuasive.B. SUMMARY1. THE BASIC TIMELINE OF EVENTS ACCORDING TO BERLITZ AND MOORE We are now at last in a position to summarize the basic timeline of the RoswellIncident in its second articulation by Berlitz and Moore, as given on pages89-91 of their book.> 1) 9:45-9:50 PM, July 2, 1947, a UFO passes over the Wilmots in Roswell at a> high rate of speed.> 2) Northeast of Roswell, this object ran into the lightning storm attested to> by Mac Brazel, where it turned to the southwest, was apparently struck by> lightning, and a portion of the craft exploded and produced the debris Brazel> encountered the next day.> 3) The craft itself managed to stay aloft long enough to crash west of Socorro> on the Plains of San Augustin.> 4) Brazel discovered the debris the next morning, July 3, 1947, as he rode out> to inspect the ranch. Meanwhile, Grady “Barney” Barnett claims he and an> archaeological team from the University of Pennsylvania discovered the main> craft, and the bodies of its crew, some miles from the Brazel ranch on the> Plains of San Augustin.> 5) After the July 4th weekend, Brazel then, ca.

THE “BODIES” As has already been noted, at this juncture in the evolution of the story of theRoswell Incident, there is really only one source directly tied to the incidentthat remembers seeing bodies, and that is Grady Barnett. In the descriptions ofthe bodies he gave to the Maltaises, there is nothing that conclusively compelsthat to the conclusion that they were extraterrestrial.3. THE DEBRIS Indeed, at this point within the evolution of the story, the most remarkablefact about the incident is not the all-too-human-like descriptions of thealleged crew of the craft, but the remarkable properties of the recovereddebris. In this respect, it is unusual that Grady Barnett, an engineer, did notprovide more elaborate and detailed descriptions of the craft and itstechnology.Among the salient features of this debris, we note first of all that variouswitnesses — Major Jesse Marcel Sr., Dr. Jesse Marcel Jr., Bill Brazel and hissister Bessie Brazel Schreiber — concur in their basic descriptions of theproperties of the debris, and the presence of unusual “hieroglyphic” or symbolicpictograms of some sort on some of the material.4. PROBLEMS WITH THE BALLOON THEORY All of these considerations point to considerable problems with the Air Force’sfirst attempted cover-up with its weather balloon story of mistakenidentification. In spite of the arguments of skeptics — which we shall encounterlater — the fact remains that Major Marcel, the senior intelligence officer ofthe only atomic bomb group in the world at the time — would be highly unlikelyto misidentify a balloon. As will be seen, there are those who also suggest thatMarcel was simply “making it all up.” But this too has its major problems, notthe least of which is that there exist FBI and Air Force memoranda from thatimmediate time period that clearly reflect the fact that what was taken toWright Patterson Field was not a mere balloon, of any type whatsoever.We are left then with a basic fact: something genuinely exotic crashed in NewMexico in 1947, and it initiated a series of events, cover-ups, and even anxietywithin U.S. military and intelligence circles. The question is, what crashed,where did it come from, and why did it initiate such anxiety within thecorridors of American military and intelligence power?The answer of the “ET” Roswell community is, of course, that the reason for thepanic was that it was something extraterrestrial that had crashed. But as hasbeen seen, the case of Berlitz and Moore leaves a lot to be desired, and ishardly persuasive.It was to address these deficiencies, and to supply new facts and witnesses,that the formidable investigative talents of Stanton T. Friedman and veteranufologist Don Berliner combined to give a much more solid case for theextraterrestrial scenario, and to it, we now turn.image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Charles Berlitz and William L.

It might be argued that Barnett knew this detail because he was orderedoff the site after the arrival of the large truck and its loading with thecrashed disc. But this makes no sense, because if the military was concernedenough about security to order people off the site and to keep quiet about it,then they hardly would have allowed civilians to observe the loading of thetruck.Barnett might have been told by someone in the military involved in theoperation, but in Berlitz and Moore’s presentation, there is no discussion ofthis possibility.44 It is to be noted that Major Marcel, in his initial interviews for Berlitz’sand Moore’s book, did not recall hearing about a second crash site.

Friedman1 Don Berliner’s and Stanton T. Friedman’s Crash at Corona is widely, and rightly,regarded as the central and magisterial book outlining the standard scenario andtimeline of the Roswell crash, and the subsequent U.S. military cover-up, fromthe perspective that the event was the crash and recovery of an extraterrestrialcraft, its technologies, and its crew. In it, new witnesses “and anyone else whomight be able to add even a tiny scrap to the slowly jelling story”2 weretracked down by the meticulous Friedman, and previously obscure chronologicalsequences or ambiguities left unresolved in the Berlitz and Moore presentation —such as whether First Lieutenant Walter Haut issued the press release on hisown, or under orders from Colonel William Blanchard — are resolved, in Haut’scase, the issue is settled by the clear statement that the lieutenant wasordered to do so.3 Indeed, in Berliner’s and Friedman’s book, Friedman’s ownlargely unknown role as a principal researcher in the Berlitz and Moore book wasclearly revealed for the first time to a wider public.4But as will be seen, their book raises as many questions as it resolves, andoftentimes these questions will be seen to be so obvious that one wonders whythey were not apparent to Berliner and Friedman, and why they did not attempt todeal with them. One such question occurs in conjunction with Lt. Haut’s pressrelease, for if it was issued under orders from Col. Blanchard, as they clearlystate, then why — if the military was so “upset” with Blanchard and Haut for therelease — was Blanchard, a West Point graduate, later promoted to the rank of afull four star general and given the post of the Vice Chief of Staff? Thequestion implies that the initial press release itself may have been part of thecover-up. Questions like this are repeatedly raised by Berliner’s and Friedman’sbook, so it is best to go through it slowly, taking note of them as we proceed.A. THE WIDER CONTEXT One of the merits of Berliner’s and Friedman’s study of the Roswell Incident istheir attempt to place the event in a wider context. The only question thatoccurs is whether or not they cast a wide enough net, and if their presentationof that context is objective, or if certain types of questions or classes ofevidence are ignored. Berliner’s and Friedman’s “wider context” is, at firstglance, impressive, ranging from top secret and now declassified memoranda, theconclusions of the Robertson Panel, discussions of the physics of UFOs, aninterview with a famous scientist, and an actual list of the scientistsallegedly initially involved in the Roswell recovery and its preliminaryanalysis.1. THE PROBLEMS WITH ANY BALLOON EXPLANATION OF THE EVENT When they wrote their book, the U.S. Air Force’s “final” official explanation ofthe Roswell Incident as a crashed top secret Mogul balloon was still in thefuture. But in that context Berliner and Friedman addressed pertinent remarks toits first “official” balloon theory, the weather balloon story put out byBrigadier General Ramey at the Fort Worth press conference. These remarks,however, highlight the principal difficulties that any balloon theory mustaddress. After the initial appearance of the weather balloon explanation, “Noone,” they observed,> thought to question why something so commonplace as a weather balloon had> caused so much commotion. Or how two officers of an elite (Army Air Force)> unit could possibly have failed to recognize it. Or how this small, flimsy> contraption, which could hardly have come to earth violently, could have> strewn its pieces over “a square mile” of sheep ranch.5 Additionally, Berliner and Friedman note the difficulty of a helium-filledballoon exploding, much less scattering enough debris “to attract attention whenspread out over an area the size of several football fields.”6 Finally, theballoon explanation is utterly out of proportion to the logistical effort, andthe sense of anxiety and urgency, that the military expended in the recovery ofa mere balloon.72. SOME PERTINENT QUESTIONS Berliner and Friedman begin their book by asking a series of pertinentquestions, some of which are noted below:> 5. Exactly what was found at the Brazel Ranch?> 6. Where was the material taken, and what was done with it (and to it) prior> to its being shipped from the southwest?> 7. Who was involved in the analysis of the material, and how were they> selected?> 8. What was done with the material when the scientific work on it was> completed?> 9. Were bodies found? If so, what were they like and what was done with them?> 10. Who was responsible for the grand cover-up of the crash and its> aftermath?...> 11. What was it doing in New Mexico in the first place?> 12. Was it one of the many “flying saucers” seen all around the United States> during late June and early July 1947? In Part Three the true significance of these questions will be explored ingreater depth, but some of these questions have been answered, and some of themwill be answered in this chapter.Questions 5 and 6, for example, have to a certain extent already been answered,for as was seen in the previous chapter, what was found on the Brazel ranch wassome rather unusual, and to a certain extent, even extraordinary debris. Thematerial was taken from the ranch initially to the Roswell Army Air Field, whereit was presumably given a cursory preliminary analysis, and then shipped to FortWorth and from their on to Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio.As for question 7 — who was involved in the analysis of the material — thatanswer will emerge presently. One may reasonably speculate on the answer toquestion 8 — what was done with the material and the knowledge gleaned from it —on the basis of who was involved in its analysis, in other words, on the basisof the answer to question 7.Question 9 — were bodies found and if so, what were they like and was done withthem — we in part already know the answer to, for as was seen in the previouschapter, and as will be further seen in this chapter, there do exist claims forthe recovery of bodies from the primary crash site, as well as detaileddescriptions of them.Question 10 — who was responsible for the grand cover-up — has likewise alreadybeen seen: it was the military itself, and that cover-up may have begun with thevery first initial story, the press release of Lt. Walter Haut and the“recovered flying saucer” story itself.As for the last two questions, we shall see in the last section of this chapterhow Berliner and Friedman attempt to answer them.3. THE MEMORANDAA. THE TWINING-SCHULGEN MEMORANDUM The Twining-Schulgen Memorandum was already encountered in the previous chapter,but it is worth considering Berliner’s and Friedman’s treatment of it, for bydoing so a certain “interpretive tendentiousness contrary to the text” on theirpart is revealed.They begin by noting that a preliminary secret Army Air Force report, issuedbefore the June-July 1947 UFO flap had petered out, came to the conclusions thatthe saucer phenomenon was not due merely to a case of reading too much intonatural phenomena: “Something is really flying around.”8 The document was datedJuly 30, 19847 and was based on fifteen sightings from May 19 to July 10.9 Thesame document went on to summarize what sort of technology and performancecharacteristics had been observed:> 1. The appearance of these objects is metallic, indicating a metallic skin, at> least.> 2. When a trail is observed, it is lightly colored, a blue-brown haze, that is> similar to a rocket engine’s exhaust. Contrary to a rocket of the solid type,> one observation indicates that the fuel may be throttled, which would indicate> a liquid rocket engine.> 3. As to shape, all observations state that the object is circular or at least> elliptical, flat on the bottom and slightly domed on the top. The size> estimates place it somewhere near the size of a C-54 or Constellation(1940s> airliners having a wingspan of 120 feet and a length of 95 feet).> 4. Some reports describe two tabs, located at the rear and symmetrical about> the axis of flight motion.> 5. Flights have been reported, with three to nine of them, flying good> formation on each other, with speeds always about 300 knots (350 mph).> 6. The discs oscillate laterally when flying along, which could be snaking.10 Berliner’s and Friedman’s remarks that immediately follow the above- andoft-cited passage, are themselves worth citing at length, before an analysis ofthe above passage is undertaken:> The U.S. Army Air Forces, fresh from a major share of the victory in history’s> largest and most violent air war, was baffled by some high-performance craft> flying through skies it rightfully considered its own. The flying saucers or> flying discs or flying whatevers were fast and maneuverable and thus capable> of evading American interceptors with ease. It requires little imagination to> picture the consternation that must have swept through the offices of> high-ranking Army Air Forces people in Washington when faced with this> mysterious incursion that had to be considered a potential threat.> What could they say when President Harry Truman asked them what in hell was> going on? They couldn’t claim to know what the flying saucers were, for they> would then have to provide details they didn’t have. They also couldn’t very> well admit that there were unknown craft flying through American skies with> impunity, for the ensuing questions would be far too embarrassing to> contemplate. What if the Senate Armed Services and Appropriations committees> got wind of the USAAF’s inability to cope with foreign machines flying over> American cities?> …> The only solution was to launch an all-out effort to find out what the flying> saucers were, and to keep the entire matter totally secret from the public and> from most of the government until the USAAF could regain control of the> skies.11Berliner’s and Friedman’s choice of words — “foreign machines” — is oddlysuggestive in a book otherwise concerned with arguing that the Roswell Incidentwas an extraterrestrial crash-and-recovery event. Nonetheless their generalpoint is universally acknowledged by all – including this author — who acceptthe reality of the 1947 UFO flap, namely, that the craft and whoever it belongedto, was entering American airspace over some of the U.S. military’s mostsensitive installations with impunity, with a technological and performancecapability that left the United States Army Air Force in the dust. Indeed, thisfact alone constitutes one basis for the urgency and anxiety that it felt overthe issueAll the more remarkable, then, is the fact that Berliner and Friedman make theseremarks in conjunction with the citation from the memorandum of July 30, 1947,for observe carefully what the implications of that memorandum are:> 1) The technology as described in the document appears to be some unique form> of rocketry or, at the maximum, an unusual craft fueled by a conventional type> of fuel; in short, the craft leave exhaust and vapor trails, hardly what one> would expect from an advanced extraterrestrial craft!> 2) The stated performance characteristics — 350 miles per hour — are hardly> sufficient to make the craft described in the document anything even close to> a practical interplanetary craft, for such speeds are not only far too slow> for interplanetary travel, they are far below the required escape velocity to> escape the gravitational well of planet Earth even to reach outer space! To> assume that the craft have greater performance capabilities is logical, since> American interceptors of the period could easily top speeds of 350 miles per> hour. However, beyond being able to outdistance and/or out-maneuver our> interceptors, we do not know the maximum performance characteristics beyond> assuming them being several hundreds of miles per hour. Anything beyond that> is an argument from silence.> 3) Finally, the craft described in the document are relatively small, no> larger than common Earth airliners of the period, thus — once again — making> it highly unlikely that they represent any craft suitable for long-term> interplanetary voyages (and such voyages would be unbearably long at the> plodding “pony express” speeds of 350 miles — give or take a few hundred miles> - per hour)! To put it succinctly, neither the technology nor the performance characteristicsof the document cited by Berliner and Friedman are anywhere near what they wouldneed to be for a practical interplanetary and extraterrestrial craft. To put iteven more succinctly, the physics and technology described are not exotic enoughto be extraterrestrial, period.What is even more remarkable is that Stanton Friedman, a credentialed nuclearphysicist who has worked on top secret government black projects in nuclearpropulsion, would surely have known this, and Berliner, no slouch himself, wouldas well. Yet, they make no mention of this difficult fact.Undaunted by these inconveniences, Berliner and Friedman continue to cite othermemoranda. For example, “Less than two months later, on September 23, 1947, amore detailed report was prepared by the Air Force’s Air Material Command (thetechnical and scientific establishement) for Air Force intelligence.” Thatreport concluded that “the phenomenon is something real and not fictitious.”12All of the above informs their citation and analysis of the October 28, 1947draft order for intelligence on UFOs, an order in turn based upon “anintelligence collection memorandum from Brig. Gen. George Schulgen, chief of theUSAF’s Air Intelligence Requirements Division” and “based on a summary offlying-saucer characteristics supplied to him by Lt. Gen. Nathan Twining,commander of the Air Material Command.”13 They then cite the order:> This strange object, or phenomenon, may be considered, in view of certain> observations, as long-range aircraft capable of a high rate of climb, high> cruising speed and highly maneuverable and capable of being flown in very> tight formations. For the purpose of analysis and evaluation of these> so-called “flying saucers,” the object sighted is being assumed to be a manned> craft of unknown origin. While there remains the possibility of Russian> manufacture, based on perspective thinking and actual accomplishments of the> Germans, it is the considered opinion of some elements that the object may in> fact represent an interplanetary craft of some kind. 14 Notably, this section of the memorandum indicates two possible origins for theobject: a terrestrial, Russian one, based on German designs, or anextraterrestrial one. Thus, we have one ready explanation as to why the wreckagewas sent to Wright Field in Dayton, for not only was it the headquarters of theAir Material Command, but it was also headquarters to such German Paperclipscientific luminaries as Dr. Walter Lippisch, who lectured his American hosts onthe design requirements for super-sonic aircraft.15 If a German origin for therecovered Roswell wreckage had been suspected by the military, Wright Field wasthe logical destination for that reason as well.Berliner and Friedman then observe that “within the order are several referencesthat make little sense unless read in the context of presumed knowledge of aflying saucer that crashed several months earlier in New Mexico. These are shownin boldface in the following partial breakdown of the types of information beingsouth by USAF Intelligence.”16 They then cite the relevant section of the order:> Construction.> a. Type of material, whether metal, ferrous, non-ferrous or non-metallic.> b. Composite of sandwich construction utilizing various combinations of> metals, metallic foils, plastics, and perhaps balsa wood or similar material.> c. Unusual fabrication methods to achieve extreme light weight and structural> stability.> d. Unusual features or provisions regarding the opening and closing of doors. > Landing Gear.> a. Indicate type of landing gear — whether conventional, tricycle, multiple> wheel, etc., or of an unconventional type such as tripod or skid.> b. Provisions for takeoff from ice, snow, sand, or water. > Powerplant.> a. (3. Nuclear propulsion (atomic energy). Atomic energy engines would> probably be unlike any familiar type of engine, although atomic energy might> be employed in combination with any of the above types (piston, jet). Aircraft> would be characterized by lack of fuel systems and fuel storage space.> b. The powerplant would likely be an integral part of the aircraft and> possibly not distinguishable as an item separate from the aircraft.17 As Berliner and Friedman have already observed, these sections of theIntelligence Collection Memorandaum strongly resemble the characteristics of thedebris described by Marcel and Brazel’s children in the previous chapter. Norcould these observations have come from long range observation, for details suchas the extreme light weight of the materials and the craft, its structuralstability, or details such as metallic foils or “balsa wood,” could not havecome from anything else other than hands-on observation.18But this only emphasizes the significance of the proposed “terrestrial” originof the object, for as the memorandum itself stipulates, the technology describedis close to “the thinking and accomplishments of the Germans.” And part of thatthinking, as will become evident in Part Three, is based precisely on theprinciple of integrating the powerplant into the actual structure of theaircraft so that it is “not distinguishable as an item separate from theaircraft.” From the documentary evidence cited by Berliner and Friedmanthemselves, in their now classic study of the Roswell incident, it is beginningto look as if the concept of the crash of a craft from an independent postwarNazi project might have some merit after all.B. PROJECT SIGN AND GENERAL HOYT VANDENBERG’S CONCLUSION In this regard, it is essential to mention another document referred to byBerliner and Friedman: Project Sign’s “legendary Top Secret Estimation of theSituation,” produced some time in August 1948.19 Project Sign was the then topsecret Air Force UFO study committee. This “Top Secret Estimate of theSituation,” according to Berliner and Friedman, “allegedly concluded that thesaucers were probably extraterrestrial.”20 This report then “went all the way upto the Chief of Staff, Gen Hoyt Vandenberg, who rejected its conclusion aslacking evidence.”21 Indeed, if the technological and performance data on whichthe extraterrestrial conclusion was based was no stronger than the technologicaland performance data of the original intelligence gathering order, then one canhardly blame General Vandenberg for doing so.Then, on October 7, 1948, a letter from Colonel H.H. McCoy was received by theCentral Intelligence Agency.22 The letter stated that the Project Signheadquarters> is currently engaged in an intelligence investigation of all reported> unidentified aerial phenomana. No concrete evidence as to the exact identity> of any of the reported objects has been received. Similarly, the origin of the> so-called ‘flying discs’ remains obscure.23 But what does the word “obscure” mean in this context? One possibility is thatthe functioning of the craft themselves - whether extraterrestrial orterrestrial - remained obscure. But the other possibility is that, while theirgeneral nature and origin might have been known or strongly suspected, theirultimate point of origin remained “obscure.”On December 10, 1948, some two months later, “the USAF’s Directorate ofIntelligence issued a lengthy Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the U.S.that remained Top Secret until 1985.”24 According to Berliner and Friedman, thereport “strongly suggested” that the saucers represented “Soviet developmentsbased on captured Nazi German technology.”25 They also observe that someufological circles believed that the report is simply a reworking of the earlier“Top Secret Estimate of the Situation” by “with the material about theextraterrestrial nature of the saucers replaced by that about Soviet/Nazi craftwhich would have been more palatable to the Air Force.”26 But one wondersexactly how Soviet/Nazi craft, that easily outclass and outperform USAFaircraft, and that violate American airspace over the most sensitive militaryinstallations with impunity, are “more palatable” than extraterrestrial craft.Indeed, in the latter case, “ET’s” motivations for doing so would be unknown,and therefore, not necessarily hostile. But Soviet or Nazi violations ofAmerican airspace would certainly have a more sinister motivation. And if at anytime the USAF suspected that such violations were being made by an independentpostwar extraterritorial Nazi entity or organization, then that would constitutea sufficient reason for the military’s sense of urgency and anxiety over thematter, and would hardly be “palatable” to the Air Force.C. THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE ROBERTSON PANEL In this respect, it is worth noting that the Robertson Panel — the top secretspecial committee that met in 1953 to study the Air Force’s UFO reports —concluded that the UFOs “showed no evidence of being a threat to nationalsecurity” on the one hand, but neither did it conclude that they were“extraterrestrial spacecraft.”27 One wonders exactly how, in the tangled logicof committees, it was concluded that non-extraterrestrial — and thereforeterrestrial — craft that could enter and leave American airspace with impunity,whose origins remained “obscure,” and whose technological and conceptualsignatures suggested a Nazi origin, were concluded not to represent a threat toAmerica’s national security.4. THE SMITH-SARBACHER INTERVIEWA. “MAGNETIC FIELDS COLLAPSE” A little later into their book, Berliner and Friedman recount a famous episodein ufology from the 1950s, the strange case of Canadian engineer Wibert B.Smith, known in the 1950s to have a “strong interest in UFOs”28 and who was also“considered a highly qualified engineer who explored a number of unconventionalconcepts involving gravity and electromagnetism.”29> In 1979, Stanton Friedman was shown a formerly top-secret memorandum by> Canadian investigator Scott Forster. It had been sent to the Controller of> Telecommunications of the Canadian Department of Transport by Wlibert B.> Smith, a senior radio engineer who was working on geomagnetism. The startling> portion of the November 21, 1950, memo…read: > “I made discreet inquiries through the Canadian Embassy staff in Washington> who were able to obtain for me the following information: “a. The matter is the most highly classified subject in the United StatesGovernment, rating even higher than the H-bomb.“b. Flying saucers exist.“c. Their modus operandi is unknown but concentrated effort is being made by asmall group headed by Doctor Vannevar Bush.“d. The entire matter is considered by the United States authorities to be oftremendous significance.”30Further investigation by researcher Arthur Bray, who managed to find the son ofWilbert Smith, led to the discovery of Smith’s handwritten notes of an interviewhe conducted through a “Lt./C. Bremer”31 with the American physicist, Dr. RobertSarbacher. Smith’s pointed questions, and Sarbacher’s careful and cagey answers,are worth pondering:> SMITH: I am doing some work on the collapse of the earth’s magnetic field as a> source of energy, and I think our work may have a bearing on the flying> saucers.> SARBACHER: What do you want to know?> SMITH: I have read (Frank) Scully’s book on the saucers (Behind the Flying> Saucers) and would like to know how much of it is true.> SARBACHER: The facts reported in the book are substantially correct.> SMITH: Then the saucers exist?> SARBACHER: Yes, they exist.> SMITH: Do they operate as Scully suggests, on magnetic principles?> SARBACHER: We have not been able to duplicate their performance.> SMITH: Do they come from some other planet?> SARBACHER: All we know is, we didn’t make them, and it’s pretty certain they> didn’t originate on the earth.> SMITH: I understand the whole subject of saucers is classified.> SARBACHER: Yes, it is classified two points higher even then the H-bomb. In> fact it is the most highly classified subject in the U.S. Government at the> present time.> SMITH: MY I ask the reason for the classification?> SARBACHER: You may ask, but I can’t tell you.32 Note Sarbacher’s rather strange answer to Smith’s question “Do they come fromother planets?” Rather than responding with a simple “yes,” Sarbacher’s answeris a study in carefully crafted and suggestive ambiguity: “All we know is, wedidn’t make them, and it’s pretty certain they didn’t originate on the earth.”What is meant by “we” in the second clause of his answer? Does “we” refer tohumanity as a whole? Or does Sarbacher have in mind a more narrow understandingof “we”, “we” meaning “Americans”? Secondly, note Sarbacher’s response that thewhole subject is classified higher than the hydrogen bomb. Why? What couldpossibly require such a classification if — as the Robertson Panel concluded —they represented no threat to national security? Sarbacher’s answer suggeststhat whatever the physics or power is represented in the phenomenon, it farexceeds that of the mere hydrogen bomb. Finally, not Smith’s initial statementconcerning “the collapse of the earth’s magnetic field as a source of energy.”As will be seen in the final chapter of this book, Smith’s statement affords aprofound clue into why the whole subject was given such extreme classificationby the American authorities, for they were simply following an earlierprecedent…B. THE SCIENTISTS INVOLVED AT ROSWELL Another UFO researcher, William Steinman, corresponded with Sarbacher in 1983,and asked him the names of the scientists that were involved in the study ofrecovered UFOs. In his answer, Sarbacher indicated that Dr. Vannevar Bush, Dr.John von Neuman, and Dr. Robert Oppenheimer were “definitely involved,” and thathe was “sure that they would have asked Dr. von Braun.”33 The inclusion of Dr.von Braun, as will be seen in Part Three, is highly significant.B. THE DEBRIS AND THE BODIES1. A METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTION There are two basic types of data with which any explanation of the RoswellIncident, whether “balloon,” crashed extraterrestrial craft, or crashed blackproject — Nazi or otherwise — must contend, and these are (1) the bodies, and(2) the debris. Careful examination of all pro-ET interpretations of the RoswellIncident will reveal, however, that the emphasis of those expositions is on thebodies, and that the bodies, in turn, form the interpretive context by which toargue that the recovered debris is itself of an exotic and extraterrestrialnature.Berliner and Friedman state this methodological assumption in the followingmanner:> The presence in New Mexico of very strange substances from the wreckage of the> two crashes has been testified to by so many people that it is virtually> proved. That the wreckage was accompanied by the bodies of as many as eight> small humanoid aliens is another matter. A few people have described, in> limited but highly consistent detail, their awareness of even direct> observation of miniature, out-of-proportion bodies at the crash sites and> elsewhere. The evidence for them is increasingly impressive, but perhaps not> yet completely convincing. > However, like the acquisition of totally unfamiliar manufactured materials of> striking physical characteristics, the confirmed existence of obviously> nonhuman bodies will, by itself, establish not only the reality of UFOs but> also their extraterrestrial origin.34Since the context of these remarks is their general argumentation that theRoswell Incident was the crash and recovery of an extraterrestrial craft and itscrew, we are justified as taking these general remarks as indicative of themethodological assumptions underpinning their arguments.As such, there are several points to be observed in their comments:> 1) Note first that Berliner and Friedman themselves admit that the evidence> for the “bodies” being of an extraterrestrial nature “is increasingly> impressive, but perhaps not yet completely convincing.” But as will be seen in> Part Three, this remark is tendentious at best and question-begging at worst,> since there do exist plausible explanations for the physiological> characteristics of the bodies, explanations which would point clearly to their> terrestrial origins. As was seen in the previous chapter,35 the most detailed> description of these bodies comes from Grady “Barney” Barnett, but> unfortunately, Barnett was long dead by the time that his description was> revealed to Roswell researchers by the second-hand testimony of the Maltaises.> We shall, in Part Three, take the same list of characteristics and show how> they can be rationalized as being of terrestrial origin.> 2) One must also note that, in the absence of any attempt by Berliner and> Friedman to explain the various characteristics of the recovered debris on a> terrestrial basis, the conclusion is drawn — and therewith the question is> begged — that the debris is “of totally unfamiliar manufactured materials.”> But “unfamiliar” does not necessarily compel to an extraterrestrial> conclusion. Thus, one derives the methodological principle that became the> lynchpin and keystone in the argumentative arch propping up the ET> interpretation of the incident, for “nonhuman bodies will, by itself,> establish not only the reality of UFOs but also their extraterrestrial> origin.” In other words, In Roswell’s case “the bodies interpret the debris,> and not vice versa.” And this implies one final, and highly significant, point:> 3) If a plausible terrestrial history or technology tree, or set of> physiological anomalies, can be shown to exist for any of the recorded details> both of the bodies and of the debris, then the case for an extraterrestrial> interpretation of the incident collapses. In that case, another explanation> will have to be advanced for the following correlative points that have been> employed by pro-ET interpretations for the incident:> a) The apparent urgency and extreme anxiety — one is tempted to say “panic” —> exhibited by the military in reaction to the incident;> b) The care that the military took to transport the bodies and debris for> analysis; and,> c) The fact that the military did not become involved in the incident until> after it was informed of the existence of the debris by civilian rancher Mac> Brazel. In other words, had the crashed craft been from any American black> project — including the top secret Mogul balloon project — why was no effort> being made by the military to find what had happened to its missing project? From careful consideration of point 3 above, it follows that neither the bodiesnor the debris should form an interpretive context by which to understand theother. Rather, it follows from the methodological assumptions implicit in point3, that each dataset will have to be examined independently, and an inductivecase made in each instance.2. THE GLENN DENNIS STORY Having made these statements, Berliner and Friedman then introduce the “starwitness” — so to speak — for the case that the bodies are to be characterized asextraterrestrial: mortician Glenn Dennis. Dennis was at the time of the Incidenta “young professional mortician in Roswell” in the employment of “the BallardFuneral Home,” which “had the contract with the Roswell Army Air field toprovide mortuary services.”36 On numerous occasions Dennis had been called upon“to help collect mangled bodies from military plane crashes and then prepare theremains for shipment back to the survivors…. It was this unusual ease of accessto an otherwise secure military installation that enabled him to see and hear alot more than he was supposed to.”37 In an interview in August of 1989 conductedby Stanton Friedman, Dennis recalled an incident that occurred probably on July9th or 10th.According to Dennis, he had received several phone calls from the base asking avery unusual question: What were the smallest sizes of hermetically sealedcaskets the funeral home could get? Additionally, the base also wanted to knowthe chemical composition of the solutions used for embalming, what the chemicalcomposition of blood was, how tissue broke down, and how it decomposed whenlaying in the sun for “several days.”38 As Dennis recollected these strangephone calls to Friedman, he added “They kept saying, ‘OK, what’s this going todo to the blood system, what’s this going to do to the tissue?’”39But there was more:> Then when they informed me that these bodies (had) laid out in the middle of> July, in the middle of the prairie, I mean that body’s going to be as dark as> your (blue) blazer, there, and it’s going to be in bad shape. I was the one> who suggested (using dry ice… I’d done that a time or two.> … What they were really after was how to move those bodies, or where they> were. But they kept talking about these bodies, and I said, “What do the> bodies look like? And they said, “I don’t know, but I’ll tell you one thing:> This happened some time ago.” The only thing that was mentioned was that they> were exposed to the elements for several days.40So far so good, but here an obvious question occurs: If the bodies were alreadyin a state of decomposition and decay, how could one conclude a compelling casethat they were extraterrestrial? Of course, Berliner and Friedman are honestenough — as has been seen by their methodological remarks — to admit that thecase for the recovery of extraterrestrial bodies at Roswell is “not yetcompletely convincing.” But the point is, that any recollection of observedphysiological characteristics of such bodies must bear in mind that underdecomposition, such bodies might appear to be something that in fact they arenot, i.e., extraterrestrial.But this is not all there is to Dennis’ story. That evening, “around 6:00 or7:00 P.M.” — Dennis drove an injured GI “to the base infirmary, which was in thesame building as the hospital and the mortuary.”41 Dennis, after walking the manto the infirmary, then drove to the back of the building in hopes ofencountering a young Army nurse that he was acquainted with. Dennis thenrecounted for Friedman that> There were two MPs standing right there, and I got out and started to go in. I> wouldn’t have gotten as far as I did, if I hadn’t parked in the Emergency> area. They probably thought I was coming after somebody. The doors were open> to the military ambulances and that’s where some wreckage was, and there was> an MP on each side. I saw all this wreckage.> I don’t know what it was, but I knew there was something going on… What was so> curious about it, was that in two of those ambulances was a deal that looked> like (the bottom) half of a canoe. It didn’t look like aluminum…you know what> stainless steel’s like when you put heat on it? How it’ll turn kinda purplish,> with a kind of blue hue to it? (Glen later said that he saw a row of> unrecognizable symbolds — several inches high — on the metal devices.) I just> glanced in and kept going.> When I got inside, I noticed there was quite a bit of activity. When I went> back into the lounge, there were “big birds”…everywhere. They were really> shook up. So I went down the hall where I usually go, and I got down the hall> just a little way and an MP met me right there. He wanted to know who the hell> I was and where I was from, and what business did I have there? I explained> who I was. Evidently he was under the impression that they called me to come> out.> Anyway, I got past that and I went on in and then this is where I met the> nurse — she was involved in this thing, she was on duty. She told me, “How in> the hell did you get in here?” I said, “I just walked in.” She said, “My God,> you are going to get killed!” And I said, “They didn’t stop me!” I was going> to the Coke machine to get us a Coke, and this big red-headed colonel said,> “What’s that son of a bitch doin’ here?”> He hollered at the MPs and that’s when it hit the fan! These two MPs grabbed> me by the arms and carried me clear outside… they carried me to the ambulance…> I didn’t walk, they carried me! And they told me to get my ass out of> there!...> About two or three hours later, they (called) and told me, “You open your> mouth (about this) and you’ll be so far back in the jug they’ll have to shoot> pinto beans (into you) with a bean shooter!” I just laughed and said, “Go to> hell!”42The nurse called Dennis the next day, very upset, and they then arranged to meetfor lunch at the officer’s club on the base.At this point in Dennis’ story, one encounters the first description of thebodies apart from that of Grady “Barney” Barnett’s:> “That’s when she told me they did have some bodies. She said there were three> little bodies; two of them were just mangled beyond everything, but there was> one of them that was really in pretty good condition.> “And she said, ‘Let me show you the difference between our anatomy and theirs.> Really, what they looked like was ancient Chinese: small, fragile, no hair.’> She said their noses didn’t protrude, the eyes were set pretty deep and the> ears were just little indentations. She said the anatomy of the arms was> different (the upper arm was longer than the lower). They didn’t have thumbs,> they had four different….she called them ‘tentacles,’ I think. Didn’t have any> fingernails. She then described how they had little things like suction cups> on their fingertips.43At this juncture, Dennis recounted to Friedman that his nurse friend describedthe horrible smell of the bodies, a smell so bad one could not come closer than100 feet without gagging.44 She then pulled out a prescription pad and drewsketches of the dead bodies. Giving him these drawings, she warned him to keepthem secret. However, when Dennis and Friedman attempted in 1990 to retrievethese drawings from his old files at the funeral home, they discovered that hismaterials had all been previously thrown out some years prior to that.45 Dennisthen sketched for Friedman as best as he could, and from memory, what his nursefriend’s sketches looked like.However, there is a problem to Dennis’ story, and the reader will have alreadyspotted it, and it is a problem that Berliner and Friedman readily admit, forwhile they knew the nurse’s name, it was not revealed in their book. Moreover:> (Dennis) never saw her again. Attempts to get in touch with her were met with> obstruction. He was told she was away at a seminar, then that she had been> transferred to England without even getting in touch with him. His first> letter was answered with a cryptic promise from her to explain everything at a> later date. His second letter was returned, stamped Deceased.> Efforts to trace the nurse have been unsuccessful. There is no file on her in> the permanent military records office where all persons who have died while in> service are supposed to be recorded. There is no evidence that anyone by her> name served as an army nurse.46To sum up Dennis’ story, we note that his anonymous nurse described bodies whosephysiological anomalies could definitely be construed as extraterrestrial;according to him, his nurse friend stated that they:> 1) looked like “ancient Chinese”;> 2) were small and fragile;> 3) had no hair;> 4) their noses did not protrude;> 5) the eyes were set deep in the heads;> 6) the ears were little indentations;> 7) their upper arms were longer than the lower arms;> 8) they had no thumbs and only four fingers, which she described as> “tentacles,” with little suction cups on the fingertips; and finally,> 9) there was an overpowering malodorous smell, presumably the result of the> already well-progressed decomposition of the bodies. But the problem with this list is precisely that it is a second-hand dead-man’stestimony of a nurse whose existence not even the meticulous Stanton Friedmancould track down or verify. This is an important point, for Berliner andFriedman, let it be noted, do not place the heavy emphasis on Dennis’ story thatRoswell skeptics would later claim they do.3. THE GERALD ANDERSON STORYA. PRELIMINARY CONTEXT There is, however, one minor detail of the Glenn Dennis story that stands out ashaving some corroboration, and it is corroboration that Berliner and Friedman,with their normally clear exposition and ability to connect dots, have unusuallymissed. As was seen from Dennis’ recounting of the episode with the bodies atthe base, there was clear indication that the bodies had lain in the field underthe hot New Mexico July sun for some undetermined number of days. GrantingDennis’ story is accurate for the sake of argument, one can reconstruct thebasic timeline from the facts as they have emerged thus far, for rancher MacBrazel heard the strange explosion on July 3rd, and encountered the debris thenext morning on his rounds, July 4th, and if Dennis’ encounter with the nurseoccurred on July 9th or 10th, then the bodies lay under the baking sun for atleast a week, and thus the smell and decomposition of the bodies as recounted inhis story make some sense.Additionally, as Berliner and Friedman themselves observe, “A large quantity ofdebris from a ‘flying saucer’ lay in a field outside Corona, New Mexico, forseveral days before anyone connected with the U.S. government had a clue that itwas there.”47 Let us note the logical implication of this observation in thelight of all that has gone before, for if the debris and wreckage were theresult of any top secret U.S. black project, one moreover involving a crew andbodies, then it is extremely unlikely that the military would not have gonelooking for the missing project much earlier than it did. Thus, one may concludethat whatever did crash was not American. This leaves two possibilities: eitherit was from some other terrestrial origin, or it was extraterrestrial, and inthe latter case, as we have seen, the bodies themselves become the primary focusof the investigation.But as has also been seen, the Glenn Dennis story suffers from the acute problemof being a second hand dead man’s testimony, from a person moreover who, at thatpoint in the developing story, could not be tracked down or successfullyidentified. Consequently, by the requirements of the case, more testimony as tothe existence and anomalous properties of the recovered bodies is needed.Enter Gerald Anderson.B. THE STORY ITSELF Friedman and another famous Roswell researcher and ufologist, Kevin Randle, hadbeen involved as consultants for the production of an episode on the RoswellIncident for the cable television series Unsolved Mysteries. The episode airedin January, 1990.48 As a result of the program, Gerald Anderson contacted itsproducer, indicating that he had significant first-hand information about theIncident, and Anderson was subsequently put into contact with Randle andFriedman. Anderson and Randle did not hit it off, and Randle quickly terminatedthe relationship,49 but Friedman conducted a lengthy series of taped interviewswith him, and later that year, travelled with Anderson and coauthor Don Berlinerto the site where Anderson, then a six-year old boy, had seen the wreckage andbodies.50Anderson had come to the area with his uncle Ted, his father, and his cousinVictor to the area, hunting a rock called moss agate. They proceeded down a dryriver bed and came to a stand of trees, where, two to three hundred feet away,they saw a silver, circular object stuck into the ground at an angle, “jammedinto a hillside.”51 Anderson then described that what he saw looked like a blimpor dirigible.52 The object had torn a gouge from a neighboring hill and acrossthe riverbed.53As the group came to within about 60 feet of the object, they saw three“crewmembers laid out on the ground, under the edge of this thing, in a shadedarea, and there was one sitting upright.”54 One of the three laying downappeared to be breathing with difficulty, and the other two appeared to bealready dead. The fourth one, the one sitting up, acted afraid of the Andersonfamily and scooted further back up beneath the craft.55Anderson’s uncle Ted “was trying to talk to it in Spanish and it wasn’tresponding.”56 Anderson went on to state that the “uniform” on this particular“creature” was “Torn in a couple spots.”57 As they were inspecting the creatureand trying to communicate, Anderson recalled “Putting my hand against the sideof the saucer, and it was cold, almost like it was refrigerated. Being out therein the sun and being real shiny, I probably expected it to be hot, but itwasn’t. It was very cold! Like it was wintertime and you were touching somethingmetal. And the area right next to (the craft) was very cool…”58Anderson’s older brother Glenn walked around the craft, and Gerald followed him.They came to a rip in its side, approximately eight to ten feet tall and threefeet wide,59 and Gerald peered in:> I could see directly into it, and was looking through the outer hull and into> another bulkhead, and that bulkhead was shaped exactly like the outer hull.> You could see through the rip, and you could see what looked like components> (I don’t know if they were electrical, electronic, propulsion, or what). They> were all seemingly hooked together by these cables — clusters of threadlike> material in the form of a cable — and one of these was hanging out of that> rip. There were several hundred strands per one of these clusters, they were> wrapped. They blew in the wind like a horse’s tail, except there was> lights(sic) all over the end of them. These lights were undulating, they were> flashing. Some of them were bright, some of them were very dim, some of them> were flashing. They looked like fire on the ends of these threadlike things> that were waving in the breeze.> And you could see others of those went from one kind of package of components> to another kind of package, kind of like they were cables of some kind. And> down the center between these things — they were all in very neat little rows> — there was, like, scribbling. (On) each one of these component boxes there> would be scribbling, it was almost a pink color on sort of a brown, woodlike> background. Like it was writing or symbols that explained what this thing> was.60Anderson also recalled a strong smell inside the craft, like rubbing alcohol oracetone.61According to Anderson, at this point four men and two women approached the sitefrom the opposite direction that Anderson and his family had come. One man was aprofessor named Dr. Buskirk, and the rest were his students. Working at anarchaeological dig a few miles away, they had seen a “fiery meteor” crashing thenight before and decided to come and investigate. The archaeological group’sreactions were, according to Anderson, almost the same as his own family’s hadbeen; there was first disbelief, then talk “about men from Mars.”62 Andersonthen related a peculiar set of details:> Dr. Buskirk apparently is capable of speaking several languages, because he> had tried to communicate with this creature. He knelt down there with Ted and> my Dad and tried to talk to this thing. I recognized one of the languages> spoken as German because I had German relatives that spoke German fluently.> Ted was married to a Mexican woman and he spoke Spanish, so I understood that> one. Of course, they got no response. I recall this Dr. Buskirk tried sign> language, and there was no response from that.63 Taking stock of all of the details of Anderson’s account reveals somesignificant questions that Berliner and Friedman fail to ask, and an even morerevealing of a lack of details.For one thing, there is no real description of the bodies themselves, other thanremarks indicating their small stature; there is no description of the largeheads, slanted eyes, small noses, or oriental appearance that emerged fromBarnett’s or Dennis’ accounts.But there is an interesting ambiguity in Anderson’s account, and that is thattime and again, he refers to the creature as a “creature”, calling it an “it,”and “this creature” and “the creature” and so on, so clearly, if his account isto be accredited, there is something peculiar about the bodies. Yet, by the sametoken, Anderson refers to the fact that they all wore uniforms of some sort, andthat attempts were made to communicate with them in German and Spanish. This ofcourse prompts a question: why would one attempt to communicate with a“creature” in German or Spanish if one suspected that the creature wasextraterrestrial? What about the creature suggested to “Dr. Buskirk” thatcommunication in German, Spanish or sign language might be successful? Theuniforms? The presence of insignia? Berliner and Friedman do not say, becausepresumably, they did not ask Anderson.At this point, according to Anderson, the U.S. military arrived, again cordonedoff the site, and chased the archaeology professor and students, and theAnderson family, away, warning them all not to speak of their discovery toanyone.However, there is another problem, and it is Anderson himself. Friedman hadfirst become interested in Anderson’s story because Anderson indicated that hisolder brother Glenn had kept a large journal of this incident. Friedman managedto obtain a copy of this journal from Anderson’s cousin who was a Catholic nun.She wrote to Friedman:> With this mailing I want no more involvement in this sorry scenario, nor does> my mother. Both Maria and I have been transferred to another convent and our> Mother has been moved. This family has been plagued by this incident for years> and it is far beyond time that such should stop. Why Gerald would wish to> reopen this is completely beyond me, I suppose he has his reasons. My father> was obsessed with this unearthly horror and kept several journals to prevent> others from getting to them. Wreckage and debris from the crash, along with a> larger journal are buried out there…64 When the journal was subjected to forensic examination, however, it proved tohave been written “no earlier than about 1970,” but Anderson explained that hisolder brother Glenn had already made “several copies.”65 All attempts to locatethe larger journal that was buried in the earth “have proved unsuccessful.”66But this is not the only problem with Anderson. Berliner and Friedman observethat “charges have been made that Gerald Anderson invented the story of seeingwreckage and bodies,” and that this prompted the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR)to pay for a polygraph examination of Anderson, which Anderson passed with “noevidence of deception or pathology.”67 This was not the end of the problem,however, for in the “Preface to the Paperback Edition” of their book, Berlinerand Friedman make this unusual series of statements:> In the case of Gerald Anderson, the primary witness to the details of the> crash at the Plains of San Augustin, problems have arisen. He has admitted> falsifying a document, and has changed his testimony. Even though some of his> testimony has been corroborated by others, the authors no longer have> confidence in his description of the crash scene and the aftermath.> Nevertheless, the authors remain convinced that there was a crash at the> Plains of San Augustin in early July, 1947, at about the same time as the> crash near Corona. The basic story…remain(s) established beyond any reasonable> doubt.68Additionally, in their original book, Berliner and Friedman also revealed thatAnderson’s father had retired from a job “at Sandia Corporation, where he hadrequired a high-level security clearance because of the company’s nuclearweapons-related manufacturing activities.”69 In other words, the possibilityarises that the story was some sort of elaborate disinformation operationdesigned to cloak some black project activity. At every turn, therefore, GeraldAnderson’s story is suspect.4. MAC BRAZEL:A. THE DEBRIS Along with Major Jesse Marcel, rancher Mac Brazel, on whose ranch the debrisfield was first encountered, remains a central character in the RoswellIncident. As has already been seen in the previous chapter, Brazel’s story mustbe reconstructed from the second-hand sources that knew him: his friends andnearby neighbors, Floyd and Loretta Proctor, his children, Bill and Bessie, andthe local radio station owner, Walt Whitmore and his son.The Proctors’ son had been the hired ranch-hand who was with Mac when Brazelfirst discovered the debris field. Lorreta Proctor’s description of the debrisin Berliner and Friedman’s book is exactly the same as in Berlitz’s and Moore’s,and hence we will not dwell on it here, other than to note its consistency overtime, for Friedman and Berliner note that her descriptions were given at aconference of the Fund for UFO Research in 1990: “We cut on it with a knife,”she maintained, “and would hold a match on it, and it wouldn’t burn. We knew itwasn’t wood. It was smooth like plastic, it didn’t have real sharp corners, kindof like a dowel stick. Kind of dark tan. It didn’t have any grain… just smooth.I hadn’t seen anything like it.” 70Similarly, Walt Whitmore Jr.’s description of Brazel’s debris(the son of Roswellstation KGFL owner Walt Whitmore Sr.) also does not vary from Berlitz’s andMoore’s book and Berliner’s and Friedman’s: there was still lead-foil likematerial that could not be torn or cut, and that was extremely light weight;there were “beams” made of a woodlike material with “writing” on them that“looled like numbers which had either been added or multiplied (in columns).”71However, Whitmore then recounted that his father escorted Mac Brazel to theoffice of the Roswell Daily Record on July 10, where Brazel gave an interviewthat “bore little similarity” 72 to the story he had originally told the radiostation owner:> Brazel stated that on June 14 he and an 8-year old son, Vernon, were about 7> or 8 miles from the ranch house of the J.B. Foster ranch, which he operates,> when they came upon a large area of bright wreckage made up of rubber strips,> tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks.> At the time Brazel was in a hurry to get his round made and he did not pay> much attention to it. But he did remark about what he had seen and on July 4,> he, his wife, Vernon and a daughter, Betty, age 14, went back to the spot and> gathered up quite a bit of the debris.> The next day he first heard about the flying disks, and he wondered if what he> had found might be the remnants of one of these.> Monday he came to town to sell some wool and while here he went to see sheriff> George Wilcox and “whispered kinda confidential like” that he might have found> a flying disc.> Wilcox got in touch with the Roswell Army Air Field and Maj. Jesse A. Marcel> and a man in plain clothes accompanied him home, where they picked up the rest> of the pieces of the “disc” and went to his home to try to reconstruct it.> According to Brazel they simply could not reconstruct it at all. They tried to> make a kite out if (sic) it, but could not do that and could not find any way> to put it back together so that it would fit.> Then Major Marcel brought it to Roswell and that was the last he heard of it> until the story broke that he had found a flying disk.> Brazel said that he did not see it fall from the sky and did not see it before> it was torn up, so he did not know the size or shape it might have been, but> he thought it might have been about as large as a table top. The balloon which> held it up, if that was how it worked, must have been about 12 feet long, he> felt, measuring the distance by the size of the room in which he sat. The> rubber was smoky gray in color and scattered over an area about 200 yards in> diameter.> When the debris was gathered up the tinfoil, paper, tape, and sticks made a> bundle about three feet long and 7 or 8 inches thick. In all, he estimated,> the entire lot would have weighed maybe five pounds.> There was no sign of any metal in the area which might have been used for an> engine and no sign of any propellers of any kind, although at least one paper> fin had been glued onto some of the tinfoil.> There were no words to be found anywhere on the instrument, although there> were letters on some of the parts. Considerable Scotch tape and some tape with> flowers printed upon it had been used in the construction.> No strings or wires were to be found but there were some eyelets in the paper> to indicate that some sort of attachment may have been used.> Brazel said that he had previously found two weather observation balloons on> the ranch, but that what he found this time did not in any way resemble any of> these.73 This version of the debris that Brazel found is significant in several respects.Firstly, it is important to observe the similarity of the descriptions of thedebris to the Mogul balloon story later proffered by the U.S. Air Force in the1990s as the “final” official explanation of the Roswell Incident. In thisconnection, it is to be observed that, according to Whitmore, Brazel gave thisinterview after he had been held incommunicado by the military on the localbase, and after he apparently was spending money far beyond his means, buying anew pickup truck and a local meat locker and storage business. In other words,Brazel’s “second story” already appears to be a long-term planting of detailsand disinformation, which would eventually be given “credence” by the U.S. AirForce’s “final” official explanation with the Mogul balloon theory.That this is a likely explanation is evidenced by two curious details that occurtoward the beginning of this account, namely, that Brazel had found the “rubber”debris ca. June 14, but had only attempted to pick up the debris on July 4! Whyis this a significant clue that the whole second story was a deliberateconcoction of the military that Brazel told under duress, or because he was paida substantial amount of money for his silence? Ask any New Mexico rancher of theperiod: to leave debris from a weather balloon that could be eaten by the sheepand cattle on their ranches was to endanger their animals, for swallowing suchdebris might lead to an inability to evacuate it, or to internal bleeding orother problems, all of which could lead to the death of the animal in question.In other words, Brazel would hardly have left such debris in the fields for awhole two weeks before attempting to pick up as much as he could.There is a second detail that ufologists have noted that also points to Brazel’ssecond story having been a deliberately concocted story that he was ordered totell the media, and this is the fact that Brazel claimed to have driven intotown to sell some wool. However, the practice at that time was for the broker todrive to the rancher, and not vice versa.In any case, even in his second story, Mac Brazel ends by making the commentthat what he had found did not resemble a balloon.B. THE BODIES A much more significant role is given to the bodies in Berliner’s and Friedman’saccount of the Mac Brazel story, and this is to be expected, since it followsfrom their methodological logic as previously outlined. In a certain sense, itis a wholly new layer to the story of the Roswell Incident, since it is givenless emphasis in Berlitz’s and Moore’s book.Berliner and Friedman begin by stating their case in the following fashion:> Did Mac Brazel see alien bodies in the aftermath of the crash near Corona? He> certainly never claimed to have seen bodies, but circumstantial evidence> suggests he probably saw at least one, as well as a lot of wreckage.74 But since Major Marcel accompanied Brazel back to his ranch and the debrisfield, in the company of Counter-Intelligence agent Sheridan Cavitt, and sinceMarcel never made mention of seeing any bodies at the ranch, then where did MacBrazel see them?C. BERLINER AND FRIEDMAN’S ANALYSIS Berliner’s and Friedman’s answer to this question is an analytical one, and, aswill now become evident, a tendentious one:> Had Mac seen nothing more than the sort of scrap material recovered from the> sheep ranch by Major Marcel and CICman Cavitt (when accompanied by Brazel),> there would hardly have been any need for the army to take such extreme action> against him. Before proceeding further, note now that the exotic characteristics of thedebris itself have been subtly demoted; they are now treated as almost ordinary“scrap material” not requiring any extreme security or secrecy; themethodological assumptions explored earlier have now come home to roost, for thebodies have become the all important factor, even when, by their own admission,no direct evidence that Brazel in fact had seen any bodies exists! We continuewith their analysis:> Why take him into custody for a week and then possibly bribe him to keep quiet> about matters which do not seem that serious? He was already on record as> having seen a large quantity of scrap material and, while escorted by> soldiers, gave a newspaper interview in which he stated clearly that the> wreckage was not that of a weather balloon.> Why did the army give him such special treatment if all he knew was common> knowledge already? That little cat was out of the bag, leaving no obvious> reason for the army to exert unusual pressure on Mac to change his behavior.75Their answer immediately follows:> It seems entirely possible that he could have been flown over the ranch, which> stretched for miles, on a reconnaissance mission, as he knew the land far> better than the army did. He could thus have been involved in the discovery of> the main part of the craft, which is rumored to have landed some two and a> half miles from the field of debris….> …if what the nurse told Dennis is accurate (that the bodies were found in> small “escape capsules” such as he saw in the rear of some GI ambulances) they> probably could not have been recognized for what they were from the air. Only> from the air. Only from close-up ground observation, after a spotter plane had> first seen them and then landed close by.76While involving the civilian Brazel in an air search for the main crash site maysound plausible on the surface, closer inspection of their logic reveals thattheir speculation is rather shaky.If, in the first case, the Army Air Force already suspected that it was dealingwith something extraterrestrial, then involving any civilian in its recovery —even if by aerial reconnaissance — is highly unlikely. Secondly, whether or notthe Army Air Force suspected this or not at the time is, in a deeper sense,immaterial and irrelevant, for whether it suspected it was extraterrestrial orwhether it suspected it was the crashed wreckage of some secret project unknownto the higher officers at the base (and we have seen from the previous chapterthat, after Marcel first met with Brazel and then conferred with ColonelBlanchard, that this is exactly their first impression), it is still highlyunlikely that they would have involved a civilian to help reconnoiter for it.Why, for example, would the Air Force involve Brazel in such an effort, and notinvolve Marcel or Cavitt themselves, the original officers who saw and handledthe debris? Instead, the military ordered Marcel to Fort Worth!So, discounting their speculation, and proposing our own, namely, that Brazelwas not involved in any subsequent search for the main crash site with the Army,this leaves us with their first series of questions: why take Brazel intocustody, bribe him, and then force him to tell a story so ridiculous that anyrancher could see through it? Since the possibility of Brazel seeing a body orbodies is excluded, then the answer must, by logical elimination, be that he hadseen something truly significant in the debris itself.This tendentiousness is clearly and startkly evident by the way Berliner andFriedman recount Bill Brazel’s — Mac’s son’s — recounting of the incident:> My Dad found this thing and he told me a little bit about it… not much…because> the Air Force asked him to take an oath that he wouldn’t tell anybody in> detail about it. He went to his grave and never told anybody.> …. The only thing he said was “Well, there’s a big bunch of stuff, there’s> some tinfoil, some wood, and on some of that wood there was Japanese or> Chinese figures.”77While finding “Japanese or Chinese figures” on something crashing in the NewMexico desert in 1947 might prompt a rational person to ask “just what is thatdoing here?,” not so for Berliner and Friedman, who, once again, want to drag(extraterrestrial) bodies into it:> Had that been all Mac saw, there would certainly have been no need for the> army to make him take an oath not to talk. Not to talk about things that were> already public! Clearly, more was involved, and that could have been bodies.78 But it could have been just as likely something about the debris itself thatBrazel had seen. There is absolutely no compelling reason to believe it wasbodies. It might it just as likely have been Japanese. After all, that’s theonly clue Bill Brazel gave; anything else is an argument from utter silence. Butif so, what was something Japanese doing in New Mexico in 1947? Japan was adefeated nation, her factories and cities still lay in piles of rubble. And ifthe descriptions of “Chinese or Japanese” figures is simply an analogicaldescriptor, then the debris may have come from somewhere else. The pointremains, that nowhere do Marcel or Brazel invoke the presence of bodies, andtherefore, it is not necessary to invoke their presence in order to explain theextraordinary pressure the military exerted on Brazel; it was something aboutthe debris that was sensitive, nothing else. I therefore must completely rejectBerliner and Friedman’s statement, “while no direct testimony exists that Macsaw bodies, the behavior of the military point in that direction”79 as beingutterly and deliberately tendentious, and as ignoring other logicalpossibilities that men of their manifest intelligence surely must have knownexisted.However, in this regard, it must be recalled that it has been asserted, and willlater be argued and demonstrated, that the actual descriptions of the bodiesthat are from the most reliable sources can be shown to have perfectly plausibleterrestrial explanations. Thus, even if one grants the tendentious nature ofBerliner’s and Friedman’s argument, it establishes nothing for the case of theRoswell Incident being extraterrestrial. Perhaps there was something else aboutthe bodies, like whatever it may have been about the debris, that required suchextreme precaution and provoked such high anxiety on the part of the military.Did Mac Brazel see bodies?According to Roswell radio station KGLF employee, Frank Joyce, he did. Joycerecounted for Berliner and Friedman that one afternoon, while working at theradio station, he received a call from a man reporting wreckage on his ranch.The rancher asked Joyce what he should do about it and Joyce told the rancher togo to the Roswell Army Air base.80 The next thing Joyce remembers was thatLieutenant Walter Haut, the base’s Public Information Officer, came into theradio station, and handed him a press release typed up on onionskin stationary.Haut informed Joyce that he had the base commander’s permission to issue thepress release.81Since the release was issued on July 8, a few days after Brazel’s discovery, andthus after his initial contact with the U.S. Army Air Force, Brazel’s next phonecall to Joyce must have occurred that day or later, during the period he was incustody by the military:> The next significant thing occurred in the evening. I got a call from (Mac)> Brazel. He said, “We haven’t got this story right.” I invited him over to the> station; he arrived not long after sunset. He was alone, but I had the feeling> that we were being watched. He said something about a weather balloon. I said,> “Look, this is completely different that what you told me on the phone the> other day about the little green men,” and that’s when he said, “No, they> weren’t green.” I had the feeling he was under tremendous pressure.82 Accepting Joyce’s statements at face value, then it would appear that Brazel didsee bodies, and since in our opinion it is unlikely that he would have done soon any aerial reconnaissance over his ranch, then he must have seen them whileon the base in the military’s custody. That being so, it is important to notethat nothing in Brazel’s description to Joyce compels to any conclusion thatthey were of any extraordinary nature whatsoever. In fact, from Brazel’sstatement, we know nothing whatsoever about them, save for the fact that theywere not green!All of these considerations about Mac Brazel and Berliner’s and Friedman’s owntendentiousness calls into question their own conclusions regarding the “patternof threats” the military used to intimidate witnesses:> There is a very clear pattern concerning threats to witnesses: Those who saw> only wreckage have gotten away lightly, while those who saw bodies were> treated much more severely. Since even direct contact with wreckage would not> by itself prove the alien nature of the crash, it is understandable that> witnesses whose experiences were limited to hardware would not be considered> serious threats by the military. But even a brief glimpse of a body would have> made it pretty obvious that this was a nonhuman event…83 True enough, as far as it goes, but there is nothing, really, about “smallbodies” with “large heads” and “slanted eyes” that yet compels to the conclusionthat it was a nonhuman event, and, once again, as will be seen in Part Three,every description of the Roswell “aliens” with the exception of Glenn Dennis’and his nurse friend’s, and one other’s, can be rationalized on a terrestrialbasis. Moreover, as will be seen chapter five, there are serious questions thatcan be raised about Dennis’ statements.With Berliner’s and Friedman’s remarks concerning the relative importance of thedebris and the bodies now fully catalogued, it is worth drawing the reader’sattention to something very significant that has happened in the evolution ofthe telling of the Roswell Incident between Berlitz’s and Moore’s “secondarticulation”, and Berliner’s and Friedman’s “third articulation,” and that is,in Berlitz’s and Moore’s presentation, both the bodies and the debris receivedroughly equal weight and treatment, whereas in Berliner’s and Friedman’spresentation, the bodies have become the most compelling type of evidence, even,one is tempted to say, an idée fixe. Yet, as has also been seen, in every casewe are dealing with second hand testimony that, when it does includedescriptions, does not compel — even by their own admission — to theextraterrestrial conclusion. In Berliner’s and Friedman’s hands, it is as if oneis being told “do not look too closely at the debris descriptions,” which, ashas been seen, are much more consistent and much more detailed than thedescriptions of the bodies.5. THE GRADY “BARNEY” BARNETT STORY In Berliner’s and Friedman’s recounting, Grady Barnett described the bodies toVern Maltais in clear terms, and again, the consistency of this description withthat recorded in Berlitz’s and Moore’s book should be noted. According toMaltais, Barnett described them as being “like humans, but they were not humans.The heads were round, he eyes were small, and they had no hair. The eyes wereoddly spaced. They were quite small by our standards and their heads were largerin proportion to their bodies than ours.”84 This is the same description asoccurs in Berlitz’s and Moore’s presentation, and again, it will be argued inPart Three that there is nothing in these descriptions that compels to theconclusion that the bodies were extraterrestrial.C. IN “THE CAUSE OF OBJECTIVITY” Berliner and Friedman are not oblivious to the fact that there are otherexplanations for what crashed near Roswell, the most obvious being the U.S. ArmyAir Force’s weather balloon explanation. They also acknowledge the possibilityof other explanations for the stories of the recovered “bodies of miniaturehumanoids,” but added that “these terrestrial explanations are for the Coronasite wreckage only, as what was allegedly found at the Plains of San Augustinwas clearly alien.”85 The actual strength or weakness of these assertions willbe examined more closely in chapter five, but for now, it is to be noted thatregarding the claims of the second crash site at San Augustin, once again, inthis author’s opinion and in direct opposition to Berliner and Friedman, nothingcompels to the conclusion that the bodies there were extraterrestrial in origin,if indeed there was anything at all at the Plains of San Augustin. They concludetheir preliminary remarks about these other explanations by stating, “While theauthors find none of these alternate explanations particularly convincing, theydeserve to be mentioned in the cause of objectivity.”86 While this author, ashas already been made abundantly clear, finds Berliner’s and Friedman’stendentiousness less than particularly convincing, it remains to be seen howwell they serve “the cause of objectivity.”1. DISPENSING WITH THE WRITING As this and the previous chapter have indicated, there are clear and consistentdescriptions of the writing found on some of the debris. But Berliner andFriedman make short shrift of any potential terrestrial connection that thismight imply, and they do so with a clumsiness and ham-fistedness that almostapproaches the inane:> …(The) presence of part numbers and writing on pieces of wreckage, even if in> German, would quickly have revealed the smashed bits as something known.87 But nowhere have we encountered, either in Berlitz and Moore’s presentation, orthat of Berliner and Friedman themselves, any witness who described any writingresembling German! So why raise this point? The thought occurs that they mightbe raising it because there appears to be some sort of German connection, asindicated by the documents they themselves cited. That being said, the secondpart of their statement is illogical on the face of it, for just because thegeneral ethnic provenance of the wreckage was known, this does not mean that thetechnology it represents was known or comprehended. But as Berliner and Friedmancontinue with their “analysis” of the writing, the somersaulting inanity onlygrows:> The presence of unknown and unreadable symbols, on the other hand, would have> pointed away from the wreckage being that of a V-2.88 While several researchers have proposed the V-2 as an explanation for thewreckage, this author shares Berliner’s and Friedman’s conviction that this isan implausible explanation, not the least because the characteristics of thedebris field as described by Marcel, Bill Brazel, and others is not consistentwith anything in a V-2. But the real question is: why limit any potentialterrestrial wreckage to a V-2 when there are other, more exotic technologies inthe German inventory, as will be seen in Part Three? Why ignore mentioning thesepossibilities, especially when one claims to be cataloguing alternativeexplanations “in the cause of objectivity?”> Chinese or Japanese symbols would have been recognized as such, as would> Cyrillic, even if they could not be read.89 But as has been seen, “Chinese and Japansese” were the exact words of somewitnesses when describing the writing! Why, now, undermine their testimonies,unless one is uncomfortable with their clearly terrestrial implications? And whymention Cyrillic (or for that matter, German) at all, when the witnessesthemselves do not do so?Thus far, the “cause of objectivity,” not to mention the cause of rational andlogical analysis, do not seem to be faring too well.2. MAKING MORE SHORT SHRIFT OF THE GERMAN CONNECTION As noted, Friedman and Berliner themselves cite official government documents ofunimpeachable authenticity which clearly indicate that the Air Force suspectedsome sort of German connection, and in one case, that connection was drawn inthe clear context to the recovered debris at Roswell.A. THE FOO FIGHTER PROBLEM Berliner and Friedman cite the example of the famous World War Two “foofighters.”> These mysterious, often “playful” balls of light and shining spheres were> reported by the experienced crews of American warplanes in both (sic) the> European and Pacific theaters of war in late 1944 and early 1945. They were> said to fly along with our planes and even to play tag with them, singly and> in small formations. Not once was there any suggestion that a foo fighter had> proved aggressive or even mildly unfriendly. That, in the midst of history’s> most terrible war, suggested two possible explanations: they were something> natural (such as St. Elmo’s Fire, the eerie atmospheric discharge of built-up> static electricity) or they were insidious enemy machines not quite ready for> combat…> …. The Eighth Air Force, based in England… had a study made of the foo> fighters. While no copy has yet come to light, it allegedly concluded that> some of them might be experimental German or Japanese weapons that had not> reached operational status… (After the war, it was reported that captured> enemy documents showed that the Germans and Japanese had been aware of the foo> fighters but had concluded the mysterious things were probably Allied> weapons!)90The statement that “not once” did a foo figher prove “mildly unfriendly” is, aswe shall discover in Part Three, steaming horse puckey.Not according to celebrated novelist and researcher W.A. Harbinson, whoseProject Saucer series of novels fictionalized the case for man-made flyingsaucers he had painstakingly accumulated. In a non-fiction work entitled ProjektUFO: The Case for Man-Made Flying Saucers, wherein Harbinson outlines thefactual research basis behind his novels, he states:> While no official designation of the foo fighters was offered, most reports> indicated that they were ‘balls of fire’ that flew in parallel formation with> the Allied aircraft, often pacing them for great distances, at speeds> exceeding 300 mph, frequently causing their engines to malfunction by cutting> in and out. While a few reports of crashing Allied aircraft suggest that foo> fighters caused the crashes by making the aircraft’s engines cut out> completely, most reports indicate that this was unlikely and that the foo> fighters merely tailed the planes and caused psychological harm, rather than> physical damage. They also flew away when fired upon.91 If the foo fighters did represent some secret Nazi or Japanese project, then thereportage of their own pilots thinking that they were Allied secret weaponsmakes sense, since they would not have been privy to their own nations’ secretprojects. The question of where they originated from, then, remains. As will beseen in Part Three, the only country with anything under research anddevelopment that even resembles the “foo fighters” and with the capability ofcausing engine ignition failure in aircraft was Nazi Germany.B. THE GHOST ROCKETS: IGNORING ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT CLUE Berliner and Friedman also mention the case of the Scandinavian “ghost rockets:”> Then, in the summer of 1946, odd sky sights resumed, this time over the> Scandinavian countries. They were soon nicknamed “Swedish ghost rockets” since> many of them were said to be long and thin, like rockets. Scores of reports> were published in newspapers throughout the region, and soon the Swedish> Defense Staff established a secret commission to gather and study the reports.> Most people in and out of government suspected they were Soviet devices built> with the help of captured Nazi scientists and launched from Peenemunde(sic),> the legendary German test base located less than a hundred miles across the> Baltic from Sweden.> Detailed information was hard to find, and when the Swedish government clamped> down on all publicity (one day after former USAAF general Jimmy Doolittle and> former Eisenhower aide Gen. David Sarnoff had met with high Swedish> officials), it became almost impossible to find out what was happening. Only> in the late 1980s, when secrecy was finally relaxed, did it become apparent> that the ghost rockets could not possibly have been Soviet missiles and> therefore have to be considered proto-UFOs.92Friedman, however, went on in numerous interviews and appearances to propose anovel and indeed plausible explanation for why so many UFOs appeared to bereconnoitering sensitive American defense and research installations.As I put Friedman’s argument in my book The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, “E.T.was monitoring our burgeoning nuclear and soon to be thermonuclear militarycapabilities, as any prudent intelligent society would monitor the militaryactivities of a potential threat.”93 But as I also noted there, the idea wasfirst proposed long before, by ufologist Frank Edwards in his bestselling bookFlying Saucers, Serious Business:> The explosions of the first manmade atomic bombs in 1945 were followed by the> appearance of UFO’s in numbers in 1949….> The 1947 mass appearance of UFO’s over the United States included numerous> sightings around our atomic installations at Hanford and Oak Ridge, as well as> the great scarred area near Alamagordo, New Mexico, where we had fired out> first atomic device. 94Friedman has noted the first appearance of UFOs occurred in significant numbersover the U.S.A. almost two years exactly after the U.S. Trinity atom bomb testin New Mexico in July of 1945. The implication is that it took approximately twoyears for the UFOs to get from “there” to “here” to find out what was going on.But, once again, this misses a significant German connection, for Edwards alsogoes on to say the following:> (The two bombs were exploded over Japan: the 1946 UFO’s were over Scandinavia> and Russia. If they were looking for the source of those atomic flashes, they> had the right latitude but the wrong longitude.)95 However, if the UFO flaps represent genuine ET visitation for the purposes ofreconnoitering a potential atomic threat, as Friedman has argued, then theappearance over the Baltic is not an accident of mistaken longitude as Edwardsaverred, but a significant clue, for as I have argued elsewhere, the Nazis mostlikely detonated an atom bomb sometime around October 10, 1944, precisely in theBaltic region.96 While Edwards might be excused for not knowing the actual stateof Nazi atomic accomplishments, by the time of Friedman’s more recentappearances and reiterations of this theme, post-German-reunificationresearchers in Germany had established a convincing case that the entire postwarAllied Legend of Nazi nuclear incompetence was just that: a legend andfabrication.97C. THE DECLASSIFICATION ARGUMENT AND ITS IMPLICIT ASSUMPTION What of the possibility that what crashed was some secret American blackproject? While we have already mentioned the difficulty of this explanation,namely, that whatever crashed near Roswell had gone unnoticed by the militaryfor some days before a civilian — Mac Brazel — finally brought it to theirattention, thus making it highly improbable that it was such a project, Friedmanand Berliner have a different explanation, and it is worth citing in full toreveal yet another of their hidden and implicit assumptions:> There is always the possibility that what crashed on the Foster ranch and even> at the Plains of San Augustin was connected to the test flight of a secret> American airplane or missile. This would account for its not being recognized> by Mac Brazel, and for the entire way the episode was hushed up. At any one> time, secret vehicles are being tested in the wide open spaces of the West> where the chances of their being seen accidentally are at a minimum. This was> true in 1947 and it is certainly true today.> But what was being tested in 1947 is not secret today. Either it met its> requirements and was placed in production, or it failed in one or mre ways and> was sent to the scrap heap. Regardless, it would have been declassified and> long since would have become common knowledge. But now, even if it had been> totally successful, it would have been rendered obsolete by subsequent> developments.98 But is that necessarily true? Is it so impossible to envision a terrestrialtechnology so far ahead of its time that it might remain classified for one,two, or three decades, or even half a century? Must one leap from thisimprobability to the even more “improbable improbability” that ET is theexplanation, especially if the technology ET is using is — from the documentsBerliner and Friedman themselves cite — capable of speeds of only hundreds ofmiles an hour, make roaring sounds suggestive of jets, leave trails, and otherthings consistent with ordinary propulsion methods? Once again, the “cause ofobjectivity” seems not to be faring too well, not to mention the cause ofrationality and consistent analysis.By now I believe it is abundantly clear that the case that Berliner and Friedmanmake in their now classic study of the Roswell Incident is anything butpersuasive. Whatever persuasiveness it does have, it has by means of atendentiousness of analysis, at times subtle, but more often than not veryblatant, and often in direct contradiction to the documents and witnesses theythemselves adduce. Time and again, the reader is directed to the bodies as beingthe clearest and most irrefutable argument that what happened at Roswell wasextraterrestrial in nature, and yet, no argument is ever presented from thedetails of the descriptions of these bodies that the extraterrestrialexplanation is the only plausible and compelling one. One is left, more oftenthan not, with an “implied argument” at best, or mere assertion at worst. Eventhen, Berliner and Friedman hesitate to use the word “extraterrestrial” itself,opting for the more ambiguous term “alien,” which can just as easily mean“foreign” as “extraterrestrial.”Granted, Berliner and Friedman do make a compelling case that the urgency andanxiety with which the military handled the event belies any mundane “balloon”explanation. But when confronted by their own “documentary exhibits” and bytheir own witnesses with any statements indicating a possible terrestrialexplanation for the cause of that urgency and anxiety, they look the other way,subtly invoking ET to rescue them from the dilemma.But one thing remains abundantly clear from the documents they themselvespresent, and that is, there is a disturbing and consistent hint that what themilitary feared it was dealing with was something Nazi. Unlike Berliner andFriedman, this author believes that possibility must be stared directly in theface, and examined in depth and breadth, for in doing so, that possibilityreveals itself to be the one that makes the most sense of the widest databaseand historical context associated with the Roswell Incident.That is truly a “revisionist scenario,” but before one can perceive it, one mustfirst examine the original “revisionist scenario” of other pro-ET expositors ofthe Roswell Incident.image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Don Berliner and Stanton T.

THE REVISIONIST SCENARIOWhile there are numerous subtleties to their revised Roswell timeline andscenario, our focus will be on three key components:> 1) The military’s earlier involvement in the recovery of debris and bodies> than is posited in the Belitz-Moore and Berliner-Friedman timeline;> 2) The discounting of Grady “Barney” Barnett’s story of a crash in the Plains> of San Augustin, and the relocation of the primary crash site elsewhere;> 3) The introduction of new witnesses, and new details from old witnesses. 1. ADJUSTING THE TIMELINE: THE MILITARY’S EARLIER INVOLVEMENT The basic timeline of the Roswell Incident remains the same for July 4th inRandle’s and Schmitt’s research, but begins to change on July 5th:> During a thunderstorm near Corona, New Mexico, W.W. “Mac” Brazel hears a> tremendous thunderclap that sounds like an explosion but is somehow different> from the rest of the thunder. Others in the area report the same phenomenon.> At 11:27 P.M. the radar sites continue to watch the object. It seems to> pulsate a number of times, then explodes into a starburst. The belief is that> the object has now crashed.> Jim Ragsdale and Trudy Truelove see a bright flash of light and hear a roaring> sound that passes overhead. Ragsdale knows that something has struck the> ground close to their campsite.> Saturday, July 5, 1947 > Jason Ridgway, a sheepherder in central New Mexico, finds the remains of a> crashed saucer. He spends little time on the site and refuses to tell anyone> about it until many years later. Ridgway is a friend of Mac Brazel.> Archaeologists, including W. Curry Holden, working the sites around Roswell> stumble across the impact site where the object has crashed. One of them heads> to the closest phone to tell Sheriff George Wilcox of the discovery of the> remains of a crashed aircraft of some kind.> Wilcox calls the local fire department to alert them about the crash. One> truck, with Dan Dwyer on it, responds to the call. The site is about> thirty-five miles north of Roswell.> The Roswell Fire Department, escorted by members of the Roswell Police> Department, makes a run along Pine Lodge Road northwest of Roswell. These are> among the first civilians to stumble across the impact site.> At 5:30 A.M. the military, knowing the approximate location of the saucer> crash, move in with a carefully selected team for the recovery of the craft.> The soldiers find civilians on the site already. They escort them off while> others secure the area. Five bodies are found on the site. The site is cleaned> and secured in six hours.2Certain factors already distinguish this timeline from that of the standardscenario as expounded by Berlitz and Moore, and Berliner and Friedman:> 1) Mac Brazel is not the only witness to the strange thunderclap-cum-explosion> on Friday, July 4, 1947;> 2) The military, in Randle’s and Schmitt’s scenario, are clearly tracking the> object on radar prior to the crash. According to Randle and Schmitt, the> military sees a clear radar signature of an explosion of the craft. This> implies in turn several things:> a) The craft, whatever it is, and for whatever reason, can be tracked by radar> sets of 1947, which implies either that its technology is not all that> advanced or stealthy, or that it is malfunctioning and hence observable to> American radars;> b) If all this be true, then the military clearly knows something has crashed> three days prior to Mac Brazel’s arrival in Roswell to inform Sheriff Wilcox> of the event;> 3) New witnesses are introduced, including:> a) Jim Ragsdale and Trudy Truelove who allegedly see the crash, and as will be> seen momentarily, are allegedly some of the first people to see the primary> crash site;> b) Grady Barnett’s “archaeologists” have now been located, and can be named by> name (W. Curry Holden), and these also arrive on the primary crash site.> 4) There is a new crash or debris site some 35 miles north of Roswell, which> site was first seen not by Mac Brazel, nor by the military, but by the Roswell> law enforcement and fire departments, and by civilian archaeologists. Consequently, the revisionist scenario claims to have found new witnesses, thecorrect places for the various debris fields and crash sites, the “missingarchaeologists,” and the real point at which the military’s involvement begins,namely, at the very outset, on July 4th itself.2. DISCOUNTING GRADY “BARNEY” BARNETT As was seen in the previous chapter, the story recounted by the Maltaises wasthat a mutual friend of theirs, engineer Grady “Barney” Barnett, came upon theprimary crash site somewhere in the plains of San Augustin, and moments later,was joined by a team of archaeologists. It was his story that gave the firstreal indication of the recovery not only of a technology – in this case a disc –but of bodies. Friedman was contacted after a television documentary aboutRoswell by one Gerald Anderson, who claimed to have additional first handinformation about the Barnett story and about the crash site in the Plains ofSan Augustin, based on a diary of the event kept by his Uncle Ted, who was oneof his family members allegedly involved in finding the site, the disc, and thebodies.But in the revisionist scenario of Randle and Schmitt, the whole Barnett-Plainsof San Augustin aspect of the story collapses:> Additional problems with the Anderson story surfaced. Anderson produced a> portion of the diary supposedly written by his uncle Ted. The “diary” was full> of ludicrous errors. For example, the balloon explanation – offered by the> military on July 8 to explain the Roswell crash – is represented as having> appeared in the Albuquerque newspapers on the 5th, three days too early. In> fact, the Albuquerque newspapers mentioned nothing about balloons on July 5.> A forensic scientist who examined the diary, Richard L. Brunelle, conducted> tests that determined the paper was of a type available in 1947. The ink,> however, was not available until sometime after 1974. That was in direct> conflict with the story as related by Anderson.> Clearly this was not a document written by Anderson’s uncle Ted. Ted Anderson> could not be reached for comment. He had died several years prior to 1975.> Continued investigation broke down other parts of the Anderson story. Anderson> described a patch the leader of the military team allegedly wore, claiming> that it indicated the soldiers were from the White Sands Proving Grounds. At> that time there was no distinctive patch for the personnel assigned to the> White Sands complex.> Anderson then contradicted himself again, telling other researchers that his> uncle Ted had recognized the leader as an officer assigned to the Sandia base.> The patch described does not match that worn by the personnel assigned to> Sandia in that time frame.> Anderson’ tale continued to unravel. Anderson said that he had spoken to> Randle for only twenty-six minutes. To prove it, he produced a copy of his> phone records showing the length of the call. Randle, however, had a tape that> lasted more than fifty minutes.> Further investigation revealed that the bill submitted by Anderson did not> match the records of Southwestern Bell.3 The collapse of Gerald Anderson’s credibility, and therewith the collapse of theonly other witness who alleged having been present at the Plains of San Augustincrash site, meant that the whole story “reverted to its original second-handstatus”4 of a story related by the now deceased Grady Barnett to his neighborsthe Maltaises, who in turn told it to Friedman.However, Randle’s and Schmitt’s research then uncovered yet another detail thatdealt a massive blow to the story:> Sometime early in 1947 someone gave Ruth Barnett a daily reminder book, which> she turned into a diary. All that year she recorded everything in her and her> husband’s lives. Later, when the diary surfaced in 1990, investments were able> to trace Barnett’s movements for the year. Nothing in the diary gave any hint> of a crashed-saucer encounter. In fact, on the day the bodies were recovered> outside Roswell, July 5, Barnett was at home in Socorro.5 Additionally, all of Randle’s and Schmitt’s efforts to find any archaeologicalteam that was working the Plains of San Augustin at the time of the RoswellIncident proved fruitless;6 but they did find archaeological teams that wereworking north of Roswell who, moreover, “confirmed that they were involved.”7The conclusion was both obvious, and simple: “What this meant was that the storyof archaeologists was true. The location was wrong.”8Furthermore, what this also meant was there was “no evidence of an event on thePlains.”9> The Barnett story, at one time the foundation of such a claim, was gone. The> whole Plains scenario fails to fit the framework of the Roswell event. Without> better information, without firsthand corroboration, Barnett’s story, and in> fact, the Plains scenario, must be discarded.10 But for the extraterrestrial interpretation of Roswell, this meant that one ofthe primary supports for that interpretation also collapsed. Consequently, forthat interpretation to survive, new witnesses to the bodies had to be found, andnew details from old witnesses had to come forward. Randle’s and Schmitt’sresearch quickly uncovered them.3. NEW WITNESSES, AND NEW DETAILS FROM OLD WITNESSESA. NEW WITNESSES: THE ROSWELL FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONSE, FRANKIE ROWE, AND DANDWYER Frankie Rowe’s father, Dan Dwyer, “was a firefighter with the Roswell FireDepartment in July 1947.”11 According to Rowe, the fire department responded toa call early in the morning, July 5, 1947. Rowe’s father was on the crew of thetruck that responded. According to Rowe, her father “told us later that what hesaw was the wreckage of some type of flying craft. He did not know what itlooked like. He couldn’t tell. He said they were very small pieces. A lot of ithad already been picked up.”12 Rowe also indicated that by the time the FireDepartment had arrived, the military was already on the scene along with somepolice officers from Roswell.13But according to Rowe, that was not all that her father saw that day. Her fatheralso saw two body bags and “one live person…a very small being about the size ofa ten-year-old child.”14 According to Randle and Schmitt, “Dwyer had no doubtthat these were not human beings. Rowe remembers his belief that ‘these wereadults that were about the size of a ten-year-old child and they didn’t have anyhair…He…only saw the one…. He saw one person walking.’”15Rowe related that these were the reasons that the military came to their homeand informed Dwyer and his family that they were never to talk about theincident. Rowe also maintained that if they did talk about it, they werethreatened.16Other second-hand testimony appears to corroborate Dwyer’s account. HerbertEllis was a local Roswell civilian contractor who happened to be at the basethat day, paining the base hospital. Ellis maintains he saw the one livingcreature arrive, walking “under its own power into the hospital.” Ellisdescribed it as being about the size of a child and very slender.17Mary Bush was the secretary to the hospital’s administrator at the time of theIncident. Her brother George recalls that she came home one day from work in ananxious state and telling him that she had seen a “creature from anotherworld.”18Whatever the merits of these witnesses’ conclusions regarding the creatures thatthey saw, the details themselves are worth noting, for what is being describedare merely small humanoid beings of slender weight, with the specific termsemployed being “children” and “child.” So the question must be asked: giventhese details, are any of them sufficient to compel to the conclusion that theywere, in fact, extraterrestrial?B. THE “ARCHAEOLOGISTS PROBLEM” One stable feature to the Roswell Incident scenarios, whether standard orrevisionist, is that a team of archaeologists came upon the primary crash site –wherever it was located – and found the crashed craft and some of its crew. Butas has already been seen, the Grady Barnett version of this event was quicklydiscredited and discounted by Randle and Schmitt. So where, and who, were thearchaeologists? And more importantly, what did they actually see?The break came when Don Schmitt’s friend, Tom Carey, had been told about a man,C. Bertrand Schulz, who not only had been telling a story about a crashed flyingsaucer for a number of years, but who also happened to be a vertebrapaleontologist, and who also had spent time in Roswell. Schulz knew a group ofarchaeologists “who knew about the crash.”19 Schulz recalled seeing the militarycordon off an area to the west of the main highway north of town.20According to Schulz, a man named W. Curry Holden was the leader of thearchaeological group. Holden in fact turned out to have the right background,for he had been the chairman of the Department of History and Anthropology atTexas Tech in Lubbock.21 Unfortunately, Holden was 96 years old when he wasfound, and could recall no specific details of what he had seen, other than“that he had been there and had seen it all.”22Records from Texas Tech also corroborated that Schulz and Holden had indeed beentogether “at the University of New Mexico for the 46th Annual Meeting of theAmerican Anthropological Association, December 28-31, 1947.”23 Randle andSchmitt correctly note that this was a major discovery and confirmation of thestory of archaeologists being involved in the Roswell Incident, and moreimportantly, “both of them placed the site of the event in the Roswell area andnot anywhere near the Plains of San Augustin.”24 Unfortunately, this was aboutall these archaeologists, both old men at the time of their discovery, could do.Holden could recall no details by the time he was interviewed, and Schulz wouldonly relay the little information he had heard from Holden.25C. MAC BRAZEL’S JULY 9, 1947 INTERVIEW, AND AN INHERENT CONTRADICTION In the revisionist scenario, the rancher who first found the debris field on hisranch, Mac Brazel, not only came to Roswell, and informed the Sheriff, GeorgeWilcox, of his discovery, but he also gave interviews to the local radiostation, was then taken into custody by the local Army Air Force personnel andheld for a number of days incommunicado on the base, and then released undermilitary police guard. During this last period, he gave a new account of theevents for the Roswell Daily Record on July 9, 1947. This fact led revisionistresearchers Thomas J. Carey and Donald R. Schmitt to suggest that Brazel may nothave been telling everything, even in his first contact with local lawenforcement and the military:> We could not understand why the military would go to such lengths with Brazel,> as it had done with no other witness, if he had only discovered pieces of> wreckage – no matter how strange. Surely he could have been convinced in short> order that it was from a secret project or some such cover story, and Brazel> could have gone on his way a happy camper. Something was missing, it seemed to> us, in Brazel’s story. 26 The clear implication is that the debris wreckage – “no matter how strange” –was not the primary concern of the military, and that leaves, of course, onlythe “bodies;” Carey and Schmitt are implying, in other words, that Brazel sawsomething else, namely bodies, and that this was the real reason for themilitary’s placing Brazel under virtual arrest.Carey and Schmitt then reproduce an interview with Frank Joyce, who allegedlyinterviewed Brazel on the afternoon of July 6, 1947. It is to be noted that thisaccount, which appears in Carey’s and Schmitt’s Witness to Roswell published in2007, is the first time Frank Joyce disclosed this new detail:> BRAZEL: (angrily) Who’s gonna clean all that stuff up? That’s what I wanna> know. I need someone out there to clean it up.> JOYCE: What stuff? What are you talking about?> BRAZEL: (somberly): Don’t know. Don’t know what it is. Maybe it’s from one of> them ‘flying saucer’ things.> JOYCE: Oh, really? Then you should call the air base. They are responsible for> everything that flies in the air. They should be able to help you or tell you> what it is.> BRAZEL: (At this point, according to Joyce, Brazel really started “losing> it.”) Oh, God, Oh, my God. What am I gonna do? It’s horrible. Horrible. Just> horrible.> JOYCE: What’s that? What’s horrible? What are you talking about?> BRAZEL: The stench. Just awful.> JOYCE: Stench? From what? What are you talking about?> BRAZEL: They’re dead.> JOYCE: Who? Who’s dead?> BRAZEL: Little people. (Now barely audible.) Unfortunate little creatures…> JOYCE: (At this point, Joyce thought to himself, “This is crazy!” He decided> to play the role of Devil’s Advocate to a story he did not believe.) What> the…? Where? Where did you find them?> BRAZEL: Someplace else.> JOYCE: Well, you know, the military is always firing rockets and experimenting> with monkeys and things. So, maybe…> BRAZEL: (shouting now) God dammit! They’re not monkeys, and they’re not> human!! (With that, Brazel angrily slammed down the phone to end the> conversation.)27 Again, however, there are no details of these creatures or beings to corroborateBrazel’s exclamation that they were not monkeys and “not human.” We have only adead man’s testimony related second-hand. There is a further problem, and thatis that Major Jesse Marcel, who accompanied CIC agent Sheridan Cavitt and MacBrazel back to his ranch, never once mentioned bodies, much less inhuman oneswith a horrible odor. Nonetheless, as we shall see in Part Three, it is notnecessary to impugn or discard the testimonies concerning the bodies -eventhough there is ample reason for doing so as will be seen in the next chapter –for all details alleged for them can be accounted for on wholly terrestriallines, lines which, moreover, might induce a layman to conclude erroneously thatwhat they had seen was extraterrestrial.Brazel’s story, as we saw in the previous chapter, now grows only more complex,for on July 9, 1947, he gave an interview to the Roswell Daily Record.> Brazel reported he had found the material in the middle of June and had> thought nothing of it until he heard the stories of the flying discs. Then, at> the urgings of neighbors and family, he drove the seventy-five miles into> Roswell with a few pieces.> That had started the chain of events which lead to Brigadier General Ramey’s> announcement that it was nothing more than a weather balloon.28 But now there is a contradiction, and it raises massive questions about themilitary’s role, and the story, or stories, it was seeking to promulgate.Moreover, it is a contradiction that few Roswell proponents have noticed ordrawn attention to. Randle and Schmitt state elsewhere that> Brazel was escorted by military officers into Roswell to talk to reporters at> the office of the Roswell Daily Record….> Brazel told reporters that he had originally found the debris on June 14,> while on the ranch with his daughter, Bessie, his son, Vernon, and his wife.> In that interview, while the military officers watched and listened, Brazel> now claimed the object was smoky gray rubber and that it was confined to an> area of about two hundred yards in diameter. While no words were visible,> there were letters on part of it along with a little Scotch tape and some tape> with flowers printed on it. Although no strings or wires were fastened to it,> a few eyelets in the paper indicated an attachment might have been used.> The new story ended with Brazel saying he had found weather observation> devices on two other occasions but this object didn’t resemble those. “I am> sure what I found was not any weather observation balloon,” he said.29 Note carefully what we now have:> 1) On the one hand, the prior afternoon, July 8, 1947, General Ramey has> already issued the first “official cover story,” namely, that what crashed was> a weather balloon; and,> 2) On the other hand, Brazel, under military escort and scrutiny, states> clearly and explicitly that what he found was not a weather balloon, making it> possible that the story he told the Roswell Daily Record on July 9, 1947, was> also a story approved by the military. This behavior would be consistent if> the military was attempting to keep some aspect of the “flying saucer” story> alive. The question is, what aspect did they want to be kept alive, and why?> If the military had not wished this particular statement by Brazel to be made,> it could have easily stopped the interview, and insisted that those remarks be> taken off the record, and corrected with the balloon story. After all,> according to the revisionist scenario, the military had already made threats> to other people and institutions involved with the Incident, why not now? That> it let the statement stand is telling, especially with what happened next. The answer to that question – what did they want to be kept alive, and why? -may in fact lie in what then happened next, for according to the revisionistscenario, Brazel was escorted by the military to Roswell radio station KGFL,“where he went inside alone. According to Frank Joyce, Brazel stood against thewall and told the cover story that the Army had given him. It was a balloon thathad come down.”30 So, in the space of a very short time, Brazel has contradictedhimself again, for now he is accepting the “weather balloon explanation,”behavior that, once again, would appear deliberately designed to draw attentionto this particular explanation. Joyce’s reaction to this new version was that heknew “the story wasn’t true. He listened to it and then pointed out that it wasnot the same story that Brazel had told a couple of days earlier, before ‘theArmy had gotten to him.’”31 Brazel told Joyce “It’ll go hard on me,” if he didnot keep to the story.32 Finally Brazel left the building and “military officerswere waiting outside the station. With the new story firmly in place, Brazel wastaken back to the base.”33But what exactly was that new story? It both was, and was not, a weatherballoon! And both stories were put out when Brazel was under obvious pressurefrom the military. As we also saw from the previous chapter, the story as givento the Roswell Daily Record on July 9, 1947 was an obvious absurdity to beginwith, for no rancher would leave such debris in his fields to be eaten by hisanimals.The contradictions do not yet end. For when Frank Joyce’s second interview withBrazel ended,> The rancher walked to the door. Then, according to Joyce, Brazel turned to him> and said, “Frank, you know how they talk of little green men?... They weren’t> green.” Brazel then opened the door and left with his military escort.34 One is now confronted by several possibilities.As was seen, Frank Joyce much later indicated that his initial interview withBrazel had specifically mentioned creatures that “were not human.” As will beseen in the next chapter, there are credibility issues with Joyce’s testimony in2007, for there is a discrepancy netween his testimony as recounted at thebeginning of this section, and his testimony in 1991, as quoted immediatelyabove.But assuming for the moment that the thesis is true, and that Brazel was underorders and pressure from the military to contradict the official “weatherballoon cover story” of General Ramey by stating to the Roswell Daily Record -in the presence of military officials who could have easily shut down theinterview and inserted a proper cover story and yet who failed to do so - thatwhat he found was not a weather balloon, then the possibility also emerges thatBrazel’s story to Frank Joyce later that same day, July 9, 1947, was also, inits entirety inclusive of the detail about the “little men” not being “green,”was also something he was compelled to say by the military.In short, one might be dealing with two cover stories, the surface cover-story,the “weather balloon story,” and a far deeper cover story, involving“extraterrestrials.” It is a possibility that, as far as I am aware, no one inthe Roswell-crash-and-retrieval community has adequately considered. Thequestion is, Why would the military go to such an extraordinary length to createa cover story – the weather balloon story – which it is also taking steps withinmere hours of its release to discredit? One answer that now suggests itself isthat it is doing so as a psychological operation designed, over the long term,to keep alive the extraterrestrial interpretation, to misdirect the public’sattention from learning something else about the crash, something it desperatelydoes not want to be known.D. FRANK KAUFMAN The military’s potential role in a possible deep-cover, long-term and carefullycalculated deception only grows more acute when one turns to consider the newwitnesses to the Incident uncovered by Randle and Schmitt in their research. Atthe top of this list is Frank Kaufman.It was Randle who tracked Kaufman down, and he admitted in a phone interviewthat he had been in Roswell during the event.35 Kaufman was initially reluctantto disclose to Randle any details of his knowledge of the event, so Randledecided that Kaufman might be a valuable contact to track down other peopleinvolved with the Incident.36 But at that point> Kaufman mentioned that no one talked about the crash after the special flight> from Washington came in.> Trying to confirm that, Randle said, “No one talked about it after the special> flight got there from Washington?”> “Yeah, that’s right.”> “You’re familiar with the special flight from Washington?”> “Yeah.”> They talked for nearly thirty minutes more, but there was nothing interesting> that came out of the discussion. Kaufman knew enough that he would become an> important source. He knew more than he was willing to say over the phone.37 Randle and Schmitt therefore determined to meet with Kaufman personally.Once Randle and Schmitt finally did meet personally with Kaufman, “he was morethan happy to share his information.”38 Kaufman told Randle and Schmitt that “apersonal friend of his, a warrant officer named Robert Thomas, had come in on aspecial flight from Washington, D.C. and seemed to be involved in the retrievalin some fashion.”39 Thomas told Kaufman that there was a debris field and that asearch was under way for the actual flight crew of what had crashed.> When asked if he knew anything at all about the recovery of the debris, he> said, “I know that one crate was taken to a hangar and left there overnight.> There were spotlights on it and it was in the center of the floor with MPs> around the walls, guarding it.”> He didn’t know what was in the crate, only that it had gotten special> treatment: lots of guards around it and no one being allowed to approach it.> He also said that he had been sworn to secrecy although he didn’t know that> much. He said that they were taken into a room in small groups, ten or twelve,> and told that they had participated in something that was of national security> interest. They were not to talk about it to anyone. They were to forget that> it had ever happened.> Randle asked if Kaufman had been made to sign anything.> “No. Just told to forget about it.”> ….> He remembered the many rumors in 1947. Everyone had a theory or a belief.> There was talk of finding bodies, of finding some of them alive. Lots of> rumors. The only thing he was sure about was the crate that had spent most of> one night in the hangar with MPs watching it.40 In Randle’s and Schmitt’s reconstructed Roswell timeline, this debriefing washeld on July 11, 1947.41Kaufman’s story is important in two main respects. Firstly, if valid, itconfirms the idea that the entire Roswell air base was sworn warned formally tomaintain silence about the event. Secondly, Kaufman’s story maintained thatthere was a special flight into the air base directly from Washington, D.C.,indicating the high priority that the military placed in the Incident, apriority belying its now official “balloon” explanation. The flight, accordingto Randle’s and Schmitt’s reconstructed timeline, took place sometime on July 8or 9.42E. MELVIN BROWN Another important witness in the line-up of the revisionist scenario is SergeantMelvin Brown. Brown was then a sergeant with the 509th Bomb Group, and later, onhis deathbed, told family members that “he had seen the bodies of aliencreatures when he was given the task of guarding them.”43 Brown described the“aliens” as being> Smaller than humans and had a skin that was yellowish-orange and like that of> a lizard, meaning it was leathery and beaded, but not scaly. Given the> circumstances around his opportunity to observe the bodies, the discrepancy in> color could have been the result of the lighting conditions.44 Here, at last, are details of the dead aliens that would indeed seem sufficientto compel to the conclusion that the bodies recovered were in factextraterrestrial.Unfortunately, one has only to look deeper at the story to discover that thereare problems, for when Randle and Schmitt first cite the story in 1991 in theirbook UFO Crash at Roswell, they state the following:> After the civilians were gone (from the site), the military brought in trucks> and a few dozen men to clean the site. The bodies were loaded into the back of> one of the trucks, in which there were several large blocks of ice. About> dusk, Sergeant Melvin E. Brown and one other soldier were stationed in the> truck with orders not to look under the tarp. Brown could not resist the> temptation and as soon as his superiors moved away, he pulled the tarp aside.> There, he saw the bodies.> Like Barnett, Brown described them as smaller than human. He said the skin was> yellowish-orange, but that might have been an effect of the lighting or> decomposition. He said that the skin was similar to that of a lizard, meaning> it was leathery and beaded, but not scaly.45 The only problem is, and it is a major one, is that in Randle’s and Schmitt’sreconstruction of where and when this was supposed to have taken place, itoccurred at the Grady Barnett crash site in the Plains of San Augustin, thecrash site they later repudiate completely!46Of course, it is entirely possible that Brown’s statements should be interpretedas belonging to their own proposed primary crash site closer to Roswell. In thiscase, the statements stand, and we have our first real details that would tendto corroborate the non-human nature of the recovered bodies, and hence, thepossibility and even likelihood that they were indeed extraterrestrial.In their original presentation, however, there is more to the Melvin Brownstory. Brown had ridden with the bodies from whatever crash site was reallyinvolved, back to the air base in Roswell, where he was “added to the guarddetail outside the hangar.”47 At that point, he was approached by the commandingofficer of Squadron K, Captain John Martin. Martin urged Brown to come with himand “have a look inside.”48 Inside, however, there was nothing to see except awooden crate already packed for shipment to Fort Worth.49Randle and Schmitt learned of Brown’s story through his family. Brown had laterbeen based in the United Kingdom, and married a British wife. According to hisdaughter, Beverly Bean, Brown on his deathbed insisted repeatedly that “It wasnot a damned weather balloon.”50Brown’s story is crucial not only for the revisionist Roswell scenario, but infact for any extraterrestrial interpretation of the event, for it provides someof the real physiological details of the recovered bodies that would plausiblyargue for their extraterrestrial nature. It remains to be seen if his story iscredible, and if so, if there is any terrestrial rationalization for thesedetails.F. PAPPY AND SAPPHO HENDERSON Two other crucial witnesses were uncovered by Randle and Schmitt, and those were“Pappy” Henderson and his wife Sappho. As the debris and bodies were beinggathered by the military, various flights originated from Roswell carrying it toother points. The pilots of one of those flights was Captain O.W. “Pappy”Henderson, who “flew a C-54 load of wreckage on to Wright Field.”51 Hendersonkept the flight a secret all his life, even from his wife Sappho, until he sawan article in a tabloid in the early 1980s.> Henderson, who died in 1986, told Sappho that he had wanted to tell her about> it for years. He knew that flying saucers were real because he had flown a> planeload of wreckage on to Wright Field. He didn’t tell her much about it> except that the wreckage was strange. The flight’s destination had been Dayton> and back again. She said that it had been a C-54.> Sappho Henderson said that she had never asked her husband for the details. He> had told her the material was strange but did not elaborate. He said the> article he saw, including the descriptions of the bodies, was accurate and he> described the bodies to her.> Henderson was a member of the First Air Transport Unit which was assigned to> the Roswell Army Air Field. Colonel Jennings was the deputy base and group> commander, Barrowclough was base executive officer, and Marcel was the group> intelligence officer. All were in the 509th Bomb Group headquarters. The first> flight taking the material to Fort Worth had been a very special one as> evidenced by the make-up of the crew. Too many of the top men at Roswell were> assigned to that crew. The second flight was not quite as special but was as> highly classified. Henderson later said that it was routine flight except for> the high classification.> Henderson kept the secret as long as he thought it was required of him, but> once the information was published, he didn’t mind sharing it with his friend.> In 1982, at a reunion of his flight crew from World War II, he told them about> flying the wreckage of a spacecraft out of Roswell. There, at the reunion, he> mentioned that he flew the airplane to Wright Field and he mentioned the> bodies. And again, because of the nature of the story, those listening were> skeptical until they saw Pappy was serious. The discussion then went to other> UFO sightings.52But when would Captain Henderson have seen bodies?Randle and Schmitt answer by noting that it is highly unlikely that Hendersonwould have had any opportunity to inspect his cargo prior to or during theflight to Wright Field. However, as one of Colonel Blanchard’s “most trustedofficers, it stands to reason that Henderson would have been called in byBlanchard to fly one of the reconnaissance planes”53 over the various debris andcrash sites. Thus, “it seems likely that Henderson saw the bodies as he flewover in an aircraft and, possibly, directed the ground parties to the secondsite.”54 One of Henderson’s fishing buddies recalled that Henderson describedthem only as being “kinda little guys.”55 Henderson’s widow Sappho also recallsthat her husband described the debris as “weird…like nothing he’d ever seen.”56Clearly there is nothing in Henderson’s descriptions that compel to anextraterrestrial interpretation of the origin either of the debris, or of thebodies. What does emerge from his story, once again, is the extreme degree ofanxiety the Incident was causing the military, and the extreme degree it went tokeep some aspect of it quiet. The question again is, What exactly is thataspect?G. JIM RAGSDALE AND TRUDY TRUELOVE Jim Ragsdale and Rudy Truelove are two more crucial witnesses in the emergingRoswell revisionist scenario.On Friday, July 4, 1947, Ragsdale and his companion Trudy Truelove, drove northfrom Roswell “using old Highway 48( now Pine Lodge Road),” and then turned off,taking back roads “until they were far from the city and civilization.” Thatnight they were witnesses to an electrical storm with flashing lightning andcrashing thunder, and a driving wind of thirty or forty miles per hour.57 Ashort rain came, briefly shrouding everything in sheets of water, and just asquickly, left. “About 11:30 P.M., brightness flashed as an object roaredoverhead.”58Ragsdale described the light as a blue-gray light, similar to that from an arcwelder.59 The object roared over their campsite and seconds later “slammed intothe ground about a mile or so from the camp.”60 After the rain had endedRagsdale and Truelove attempted to find the crashed object, driving over theterrain until finally they stopped “at the edge of a short cliff. Using aflashlight with weak batteries, they explored the area. They saw the remains ofthe ship stuck in the side of the cliff but could see no movement around it. Itwas late, and the flashlight was failing. They returned to their Jeep and droveback to the campsite.”61The next day after the sun was up they drove back to the crash site. Ragsdaleremained calm but Truelove was quite agitated and wanted to “get the hell out ofthere.”62 They could not tell what the object was:> According to Ragsdale, in an interview conducted more than forty years later,> it had hit the ground, sticking in the cliff at an angle. The front of the> craft was crumpled. It looked like part of an aircraft with narrow wings.> Ragsdale said, “You could see where it hit…. One part was buried in the> ground, and part of it was sticking out of the ground.” He indicated an angle> of about thirty degrees.> ….> Debris was scattered across the crash site, and both Ragsdale and Truelove> picked up a few of the pieces. According to him, “You could take that stuff> and wad it up and it would straighten itself out.”> Of one piece, he said, “You could take it and put it into any form you wanted,> and it would stay there. You could bend it in any form, and it would stay. It> wouldn’t straighten out.”> But that wasn’t the most amazing thing about the wreckage. Near the craft,> Ragsdale saw “bodies or something laying there. They looked like bodies. They> weren’t very long…. four of five foot long at the most.” According to> Ragsdale, they looked like midgets. He didn’t know what to think. Truelove was> tugging at him, trying to get out of there. She was scared of the craft and> the bodies. Had they seen the bodies the night before, Ragsdale said they> wouldn’t have camped out there. They would have left for Roswell.63 They then heard two or three “six by six army trucks” approaching, including awrecker, led by a 1947 Ford with MPs riding in it.As Ragsdale and Truelove looked on, the vehicles fanned out and parked. The sitewas quickly surrounded by MPs, while one man, Majo0r Edwin Easley, “ordered (theMPs) to the top of the cliff where they would watch the surroundingterritory.”64 Ducking for cover, Ragsdale and Truelove ran back to their Jeep,throwing their collected debris into the back. Starting the vehicle, they drovethe Jeep into “a concealing copse of trees and bushes,” and Ragsdale crouched inthe vegetation to watch. They watched long enough “to know that ‘they cleanedeverything up. I mean they cleaned it. They raked the ground and everything.’”65Before the MPs, busily cordoning off the area, could search, Ragsdale andTruelove drove away.66Since Ragsdale and Truelove drove north out of Roswell, Ragsdale’s story isimportant for the revisionist scenario not only because he described the debrisand bodies, but also because he gave a primary crash site at another locationthan the now discredited Plains of San Augustin site advocated by Berliner andFriedman.Note, once again, that there is nothing particularly compelling about therecovered bodies other than that they looked, in Ragsdale’s own words, like“midgets.” However, Ragsdale now adds a new detail about the debris itself, forin his account, some of the “memory metal” can now be molded or bent into anyshape, and it will stay in that shape, in addition to the fact that, like otherRoswell witnesses, he maintained that some of it could also be wadded up, and itwould unravel again.H. GLENN DENNIS, THE NURSE, AND THE BODIES As was seen in the previous chapter, some of the most important testimonyconcerning the recovered Roswell bodies comes from a local mortician in Roswell,Glenn Dennis. Randle’s and Schmitt’s presentation differs little from Berliner’sand Friedman’s; they recount his story of the strange calls from the base askingquestions about body preparation,67 and his encounter with strange debris andgoings on at the base 68 infirmary,68 adding a new detail, provided by Dennis,that he was followed back to his funeral home and threatened into silence by themilitary.69But then they provide new information about what Dennis’ nurse friend saw:> (Dennis) contacted the nurse he knew and asked “if it would be alright if I> could drive out because I would like to know more about the incident…. I> didn’t make contact for two or three hours…. She called me back and said, ‘I> understand you’ve been trying to call me.’ She said, ‘I don’t want you coming> to the hospital. I would rather see you at the officers’ club.’ This was> around eleven-thirty so I got in my car and went to the officers’ club.”> He met her at the club, found a table, and ordered Cokes and lunch. Finally> she got to the point. “I want to tell you what this is all about, but you have> to give me a sacred oath that you won’t ever mention this or my name and get> me into trouble.”> She continued, “I can’t believe what I’ve just seen. This is the most horrible> thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”> She then drew a sketch on a small prescription pad that she normally carried.> As Dennis remembered it, “I don’t think she said alien bodies, I think she> said foreign bodies…. Then she described to me what happened when she got> involved in it.”70 Dennis then recounted the fact that his nurse friend described a horrible odor,making it almost impossible for the medical personnel to work, and indeed, theodor eventually forced the medical team to give up and put the bodies into bodybags.71Dennis then continued to describe the bodies, according to his friend’sdescription:> She believed there were only four fingers on the hands which were long,> slender, and fragile. The hands themselves were very small and very narrow.> When they turned one of the hands over, they noticed that the thumb was> missing. They also noticed that the ends of the fingers had little hollowed> pads looking like suction cups. The bones were no larger than a medium-sized> human finger and didn’t feel like the bone structure of a human. These bones> were brittle and felt, more or less, “like real thick cartilage.”> The head was larger than the human head. The eyes were sunken. The nose wasn’t> convex but markedly concave, who two little orifices. There was no ear, but> two little orifices on the side of the head, with two small lobes that might> have folded in to protect the ear.> The mouth was a very thin line: “very thin…. (It) didn’t have a full lip…> hardly any lip at all. In place of teeth, it looked like a piece of rawhide.> The doctors said it was even harder than the bone structure.> The bones of the head were very pliable. It was like a newborn baby…. You> could push the sides and it would be movable.”72 This was indeed wonderful news, for smelly cadavers with four-fingered handswith suction cups on the fingertips could hardly be called human in anyrecognizable sense, and it was Dennis who had first introduced this entire themeinto the Roswell story.73Extraterrestrial proponents of the Roswell Incident therefore pressed Dennis forthe name of his anonymous nurse friend……and ran into trouble.Dennis maintained that after this meeting, he tried to contact his nurse friendlater, only to learn she had been transferred to England. Writing to her a fewmonths later, the letter was returned and was marked “Deceased,” and Dennismaintained that he learned that she had perished in an aircraft accident duringa training exercise. Pressed finally to reveal her name, he gave her name as“Naomi Selff.74> After several years of searching without success for any record of a military> nurse by the name of Naomi Selff, or any record of a plane crash in England> involving American nurses during the pertinent time frame, Glenn Dennis was> confronted by Roswell investigators with this information in the mid-1990s.> His surprising and disappointing response was, “That wasn’t her real name. I> gave you a phony name, because I promised her that I would never reveal it to> anyone.” In any court of law, when someone is caught in a lie, that person is> said to have been “impeached” as a witness, meaning that his or her testimony,> as evidence, cannot be relied upon… Dennis was found to have knowingly> provided false information to investigators, and must technically stand> impeached as a Roswell witness. There is no way to get around that fact> without believable, clarifying information from Dennis himself. To date, such> information has not been forthcoming.75 So the best witness for the strangeness of the recovered Roswell bodies, and oftheir physiological details that could clearly be extraterrestrial, GlennDennis, must be regarded as impeached, and his testimony thrown out.I. THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JOSEPH MONTOYA EPISODE One of the more unusual episodes to emerge in the research behind therevisionist scenario is that connected with then Lieutenant Governor – laterU.S. Congressman and U.S. Senator – Joseph Montoya, for Montoya, according toRandle and Schmitt, may have been a witness to at least some of the bizarreaspects of the Roswell Incident.76Montoya’s lifelong friend, Ruben Anaya, was a cook at the Roswell officers’ clubin 1947. According to Anaya, Montoya called him from the base demanding that heget his car, and come out to the base to pick him up, adding “Get me the hellout of here.”77 Montoya told Anaya that he would be waiting “near the watertower on the east side of the base near several of the hangars” and that Anayawas not to go near the base headquarters “because there were too many peoplethere.”78Montoya was found waiting at the appointed spot, and when he got into the car,Anaya noticed that he was very pale and was shaking. Anaya, who recalled theevent years later, said that Montoya was “very, very scared.”79Once back at his friend Anaya’s home, Montoya began to talk:> According to Anaya he said, “You all are not going to believe what I’ve seen.> If you ever tell anyone, I’ll call you a damned liar. We don’t know what it> is…. They say it moves like a platter. It’s a plane without wings…. It’s not a> helicopter…. I don’t know where it’s from…. It could be from the moon…. We> don’t know what it is.”> Montoya collapsed on the couch, and Anaya handed him a scotch, but it had no> apparent effect. Montoya wanted something else, and Anaya give him some Jim> Beam. According to Anaya, “The man took half a quart just boom, boom, boom. He> was very scared.”> Montoya then told them that he had seen “four little men.” He described how> small they were and that, according to Anaya, “one was alive.”> Pete Anaya confirmed his brother’s belief that Montoya had mentioned there> were four little men, but Pete’s wife, Mary, thought that Montoya had> mentioned just two. She admitted that she had not been involved in the> discussions.> According to Ruben Anaya, Montoya described the beings as “short… skinnylike> with big eyes… The mouth was real small, like a cut across a piece of wood.”> Pete Anaya, who heard less of the descriptions of the bodies, recalled only> that they were small, with big heads. That was the thing he remembered the> most, the oversize heads.> All had been stretched out on mess hall tables set up in the hangar. Montoya> said that he knew one of them was alive because it was moaning. It was moving> and had its knees up, which were moving slightly. They were so skinny that> they didn’t look human. And one hand was moving, though barely.> There were doctors pressed around the table, so that Montoya couldn’t get very> close. He did see that they had no hair, that their skin was white, and that> each wore a tight-fitting one-piece suit that Anaya described as similar to> those worn by navy divers. From what Montoya could see, they had four long,> thin fingers. They were bald, and Montoya had no opportunity to see an eye> color. The eyes were larger than normal.> After a short period, the beings were taken over to the hospital. Montoya said> military personnel brought in some of the debris about that time. There was> nothing that resembled a large ship, just pieces of metal. He didn’t get close> enough to examine it.> Anaya kept asking questions until Montoya snapped at him, “I tell you that> they’re not from this world.”80 If one accepts this story as true, then it raises a number of issues.“From what Montoya could see” the bodies had four fingers. But the way theaccount is phrased makes two interpretations possible: either the beings hadonly four fingers, or, situated as they were relative to Montoya, that was allthat he could see, and they may have had more, or a thumb, that was hidden fromview. Again, there is nothing in the detailed descriptions of the bodies thatcompels to the conclusion that they were extraterrestrial.This highlights Montoya’s last explosive outburst: “I tell you that they werenot from this world.” This is subject to two interpretations: either he wastelling the truth, and that was his genuine impression (about which, in anycase, he may have been mistaken), or Montoya is telling his friend Anaya what hehad been ordered to tell him. In other words, by the logic of the case, onecannot assume that the extraterrestrial explanation of the remark is the onlypossible explanation for it.In fact, it was revisionist researchers Thomas J. Carey and Donald R. Schmittwho later uncovered yet another fascinating detail to the Montoya episode, forover the years after the initial incident, Montoya’s friend Ruben Anaya wouldtry time and again to get him to talk about it. Montoya would warn him off thesubject by saying, “It’s too dangerous to talk about. The FBI will do away withyou.”81But that was not all.Carey and Schmitt discovered that a different appeal was tried on then U.S.Senator Joseph Montoya by his longtime adversary, Senator Dennis Chavez:> Sometime after Montoya’s experience in the hangar, as Ruben Anaya recalled it,> Senator Chavez summoned him, his brother Pete, Moses Burrola, and Ralph Chaes> to the Nickson Hotel where he was staying to discuss something. After> preliminaries, Chavez bluntly told them, “Joe Montoya is a damn liar! He> didn’t see anything. It was a secret project, and it could hurt us with Russia> and Germany if word of it got it.”82 But what sort of secret project would hurt American relations specifically withthose two countries? Why would they specifically be involved in anyrepercussions? The answers to those questions will have to wait for Part Three.J. RADAR TRACKING OF THE CRAFT Another new detail in the revisionist scenario is the tracking of the object –whatever it was – by radar prior to its crash, indicating military interest andinvolvement long before Mac Brazel showed up in Roswell with his box of debris.According to Randle and Schmitt, Steve MacKenzie was then stationed at theRoswell air base, when he was telephoned by Brigadier General Martin F. Scanlon,who ordered him to report to “the radar sites at White Sands” where he was tomeet with “two others with similar orders.” They were all to monitor theobject’s movements and “report them directly to the general.”83According to Randle and Schmitt, radar operators at Roswell, White Sands, andAlbuquerque were all convinced that the object was a real object and not merelyan artifact of malfunctioning equipment or some other cause.84> When MacKenzie reported that nothing had changed significantly during his> twenty-four-hours watch, (General) Scalnon decided to end MacKenzie’s part of> the operation. Although MacKenzie was ordered back to Roswell, the operators> at White Sands were told to continue to monitor the object, as were the> radarmen at Roswell and Albuquerque.> MacKenzie was in contact with Robert Thomas, an officer stationed in> Washington, D.C., all during this time. Thomas asked on several occasions if> he should head out to New Mexico, but MacKenzie told him not to bother for the> time being. The situation was still fluid, and he didn’t know what would> happen. At two or three in the morning on July 4, however, Thomas called to> inform MacKenzie he was on the way, explaining that he wanted to be on the> scene in case something happened.85 This story, if true, would seem to indicate that whatever it was, it was notlikely to have been an American black project, since an American project wouldnot likely have elicited the concern of people in Washington.The situation did indeed change, and, according to Randle and Schmitt, did in aradical way:> The object, as displayed on the radar, seemed to pulsate, the blip growing> larger and brightening before shrinking to its original size and dimming. This> activity kept up for a short time and then the object blossomed into a> sunburst and disappeared from the screen at about 11:30 P.M. Because there> were three sites tracking the object, the army technicians were able to plot,> within vague parameters, the location of the crash or landing. > But the radar coverage in that section of New Mexico was not as complete as> the military would have liked. The Capitan Mountains sit between the impact> site and the radar sets of White Sands and Alamogordo. Other mountains rest> between Albuquerque and Roswell. Coverage in some places did not extend below> eight or nine thousand feet. That meant that the army, based on what it had> learned while tracking the object at Roswell, knew that the object was down> north of town. They just didn’t have a precise location. A comprehensive> search would be launched at sunrise (July 5, 1947).86 Again, if true, then this new detail clearly indicates that the military wasquietly monitoring whatever was flying in the skies over New Mexico prior toBrazel’s arrival in Roswell with a box full of debris, and if Randle and Schmittare correct, had actually begun to search for the crash site and any relateddebris fields on July 5, 1947. Note also that the story, if true, indicates thatthe object was observed to “explode” on the radar screens in three differentplaces, during the electrical storm on the night of July 4, 1947.K. WALTER HAUT’S POST-MORTEM AFFIDAVIT AND ITS IMPLICATIONS First Lieutenant and Roswell base public information officer, Walter Haut, as iswell known, put out the now famous press release about the U.S. Army havingrecovered a flying saucer on July 8, 1947. As has been seen in the previouschapter, there is every indication that Colonel Blanchard himself ordered thestory to be put out in just that fashion. In their 2007 book Witness to Roswell,authors Thomas J. Carey and Donald R. Schmitt revealed that Haut had sworn anaffidavit, to be unsealed only after his death. It makes for revealing reading,both for what it says, what it does not say, and for its implications:SEALED AFFIDAVIT OF WALTER G. HAUT > DATE: December 26, 2002> WITNESS: Chris Xxxxx> NOTARY: Beverlee Morgan > (1) My name is Walter G.

I had spent the> 4th of July weekend (Saturday, the 5th, and Sunday, the 6th) at my private> residence about 10 miles north of the base, which was located south of town.> (6) I was aware that someone had reported the remains of a downed vehicle by> midmorning after my return to duty at the base on Monday, July 7. I was aware> that Major Jesse A. Marcel, head of intelligence, was sent by the base> commander, Col. William Blanchard, to investigate.> (7) By late in the afternoon that same day, I would learn that additional> civilian reports came in regarding a second site just north of Roswell. I> would spend the better part of the day attending to my regular duties hearing> little if anything more.> (8) On Tuesday morning, July 8, I would attend the regularly scheduled staff> meeting at 7:30 a.m. Besides Blanchard, Marcel; CIC Capt. Sheridan Cavitt;> Col. James I. Hopkins, the operations officer; Major Patrick Saunders, the> base adjutant; Major Isadore Brown, the personnel officer; Lt. Col. Ulysses S.> Nero, the supply officer; and from Carswell AAF in Fort Worth, Texas,> Blanchard’s boss, Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey and his chief of staff, Col. Thomas> J. DuBose were also in attendance. The main topic of discussion was reported> by Marcel and Cavitt regarding an extensive debris field in Lincoln County> approximate 74 miles NW of Roswell. A preliminary briefing was provided by> Blanchard about the second site approx. 40 miles north of town. Samples of> wreckage were passed around the table. It was unlike any material I had or> have ever seen in my life. Pieces, which resembled metal foil, paper thin yet> extremely strong, and pieces with unusual markings along their length were> handled from man to man, each voicing their opinion. No one was able to> identify the crash debris.> (9) One of the main concerns discussed at the meeting was whether we should go> public or not with the discovery. Gen Ramey proposed a plan, which I believe> originated with his bosses at the Pentagon. Attention needed to be diverted> from the more important site north of town by acknowledging the other> location. Too many civilians were already involved and the press already was> informed. I was not completely informed how this would be accomplished.> (10) At approximately 9:30 a.m. Col., Blanchard phoned my office and dictated> the press release of having in our possession a flying disc, coming from a> ranch northwest of Roswell, and Marcel flying the material to higher> headquarters. I was to deliver the news release to radio stations KGFL and> KSWS, and newspapers the Daily Record and the Morning Dispatch.> (11) By the time the news had hit the wire services, my office was inundated> with phone calls from around the world. Messages stacked up on my desk, and> rather than deal with the media concern, Col. Blanchard suggested that I go> home and “hide out.”> (12) Before leaving the base, Col. Blanchard took me personally to Building> 84, a B-29 hangar located on the east side of the tarmac. Upon first> approaching the building, I observed that it was under heavy guard both> outside and inside. Once inside, I was permitted from a safe distance to first> observe the object just recovered north of town. It was approx. 12’ to 15 feet> in length, not quite as wide, about 6 feet high, and more of an egg shape.> Lighting was poor, but its surface did appear metallic. No windows, portholes,> wings, tail section, or landing gear were visible.> (13) Also from a distance, I was able to see a couple of bodies under a canvas> tarpaulin. Only the heads extended beyond the covering, and I was not able to> make out any features. The heads did appear larger than normal and the contour> of the canvas over the bodies suggested the size of a 10-year-old child. At a> later date in Blanchard’s office, he would extend his arm about 4 feet above> the floor to indicate the height.> (14) I was informed of a temporary morgue set up to accommodate the recovered> bodies.> (15) I was informed that the wreckage was no “hot” (radioactive).> (16) Upon his return from Fort Worth, Major Marcel described to me taking> pieces of the wreckage to Gen. Ramey’s office and after returning a weather> balloon and radar kite substituted while he was out of the room. Marcel was> very upset over this situation. We would not discuss it again.> (17) I would be allowed to make at least one visit to one of the recovery> sites during the military cleanup. I would return to the base with some of the> wreckage which I would display in my office.> (18) I was aware two separate teams would return to each site months later for> periodic searches for any remaining evidence.> (19) I am convinced that what I personally observed was some type of craft and> its crew from outer space.> (20) I have not been paid nor given anything of value to make this statement,> and it is the truth to the best of my recollection. > THIS STATEMENT IS TO REMAIN SEALED AND SECURED UNTIL THE TIME OF MY DEATH, AT> WHICH TIME MY SURVIVING FAMILY WILL DETERMINE ITS DISPOSITION. > Signed:  Walter G. Haut> Signature Witnessed by: Chris Xxxxxx> Dated:  December 26, 200287 This affidavit is truly explosive, any which way one slices it.As with other Roswell witness statements, we are first confronted by the nowfamiliar pattern of ambiguity, for on the one hand, Haut clearly and explicitlystates at the end of the affidavit that he believes that what he saw was thewreckage and crew of something extraterrestrial, “from outer space,” as hestates it, yet, on the other hand, there is nothing within the details of thestatement, either about the wreckage or the bodies, that compels necessarily tothat conclusion. This is not to cast aspersions on Haut nor on his motivationsfor releasing this information in this way, it is merely to call attention onceagain to the now familiar pattern.There is, however, a much more important implication that clearly emerges fromthe affidavit, and that is that General Roger Ramey was personally present atthe base during the morning staff meeting on July 8. This makes the twosubsequent statements by Haut stand out all the more:> 1) “Gen Ramey proposed a plan, which I believe originated with his bosses at> the Pentagon. Attention needed to be diverted from the more important site> north of town by acknowledging the other location;” and,> 2) “At approximately 9:30 a.m. Col., Blanchard phoned my office and dictated> the press release of having in our possession a flying disc, coming from a> ranch northwest of Roswell, and Marcel flying the material to higher> headquarters. I was to deliver the news release to radio stations KGFL and> KSWS, and newspapers the Daily Record and the Morning Dispatch.” In other words, Haut seems to be strongly suggesting that the original“articulation,” the original flying saucer story that ran in the July 8, 1947Roswell Daily Record and in other papers around the nation, was also a coverstory, and that General Ramey, who would mere hours later put out the weatherballoon story, was behind it and acting on orders from the Pentagon.To put it succinctly, it is beginning to look an awfully lot like our earliersupposition, that there are two cover stories – a “surface cover story” ofweather balloons, and a deeper cover story of “flying saucers” andextraterrestrials – is making a great deal of sense. On this view it is evenvery remotely possible that Haut, prior to his death, is still acting underorders to perpetuate an “ET” explanation by his statement that he believed it tohave been from outer space, but he is giving strong detailed indication in hisearlier points that this, too, was part of a cover-up. He may have beensimultaneously fulfilling the letter of his security obligations, and alsofulfilling an obligation of conscience to tell the truth. While I regard thispossibility as extremely unlikely, and that Haut meant what he said by hisstatement that he believed it originated from outer space, in either reading ofthat statement, Haut is giving clear indication that there was a cover-up inplace from the first issuance of his press release! In the final analysis, it isnot necessary to “construct” an interpretation for Haut’s remark about the craftbeing from outer space, for the details of his affidavit, as noted before, donot compel to that conclusion.But the story of the Haut Affidavit is not yet concluded.Roswell “Truth Seeker” Dennis Balthaser wrote an interesting article on hiswebsite, shortly after the appearance of the affidavit in Carey’s and Schmitt’sbook. The article is entitled, appropriately enough, “Walter Haut, Roswell and aWhole Lotta Questions.” The first question the article raised was precisely theconditions or situation under which the affidavit was signed:> A few things are now known, and by Don Schmitt’s own admission on the> “Paracast radio show” recently, we have learned that Walter Haut did not write> the affidavit he signed in 2002, but rather it was prepared for his signature> based on comments and remarks Haut had made over a period of time to Schmitt,> Carey and others.88 But that was not the only problem.The other problem, as is evident from our own citation of the affidavit, is thatthe witness’s “last name on the 2002 document is not shown, preventing anyopportunity for verifying what that person witnessed.”89 Finally, as Balthaserpoints out, the whole “content and style of writing in the 2002 affidavit istotally different from the 1993 affidavit Haut wrote, in which he denied anyinvolvement.”90 But the final problem was Haut himself, or rather, his memory:> We also know that the oral history videotape of Walter Haut done on November> 15, 2000 and copyrighted by Wendy Connors and myself shows a man that couldn’t> remember where he took basic training, names, dates, etc., while the 2002> affidavit is very detailed and precise with information Haut could accurately> remember 2 years after he was video taped (sic). Under constant questioning by> Wendy Connors during the video interview in 2000, Walter did agree to several> points mentioned in the 2002 affidavit such as seeing a body, a meeting in> Roswell with General Ramey and Colonel DuBose present, leaving me with the> impression of not knowing if he was still trying to cover-up what he knew> during our video taping(sic), or actually couldn’t remember. All quite> different than the 2002 written affidavit.91 The bottom line for Balthaser is that “we now know that he didn’t write theaffidavit, nor are we able at this time to determine under what conditions itwas signed.”92Balthaser readily grants that the central implication of the 2002 affidavit –the presence in Roswell on July 8 at the morning staff meeting of General RogerRamey and his chief of staff, Colonel Dubose — is “of utmost importance to theresearch of the Roswell Incident.”93 He then asks, if such a meeting in factoccurred, why it was necessary for Major Marcel to fly the debris to Fort Worthlater that day “Since they had all handled the debris in the meeting andapparently set up the cover-up operation?”94 But if the meeting truly took placeas the affidavit describes, then the answer is implicit in the question: theflight to Fort Worth and the subsequent press conference with Marcel and Rameyholding pieces of a weather balloon, was itself part of the agreed upon plan ofdeception.The 2002 Haut Affidavit thus, for the moment, must be placed in what StantonFriedman calls his “gray basket,” for neither can one hundred percentcredibility be ascribed to it, nor can it be entirely dismissed, sinceBalthaser’s and Connor’s 2000 interview itself mentioned the presence of GeneralRamey and Colonel DuBose at the July 8 morning staff meeting. However, if it iseventually proven as genuine, then as has been briefly argued above, it doeslittle to advance the cause of an extraterrestrial interpretation of Roswell.And if, on the other hand, it is eventually proven as a hoaxed document, theextraterrestrial cause is hardly advanced by that case either.L. DON SCHMITT’S ILLUSTRATION OF THE CRAFT AND THE TESTORS’ MODEL RENDITION Not all the revisionist scenario elaborated by Randle and Schmitt can be dealtwith entirely with words, for one of the major highlights of their book TheTruth About the UFO Crash at Roswell is that Schmitt, a capable drawer, was ableto sketch an overhead view of what the craft allegedly looked like, based inturn on sketches of “a first-hand witness, a high-ranking army officer stationedat Roswell.”95 That witness, whose name Randle and Schmitt never disclose,allegedly drew the following sketch on July 26, 1947:image [images/00017.jpg] The Original Hand-Drawn Sketch by a “High-Ranking Army Officer Stationed atRoswell,” which sketch was allegedly drawn on July 26, 194796 Schmitt then re-drew the sketch, adding shading and appropriate details asdescribed by the anonymous source, and produced the following sketch:image [images/00018.jpg] The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell’s Co-Author, Don Schmitt’s, Sketch ofthe Craft, Based upon the Previous Sketch and Descriptions97 Interestingly enough, it would appear that Schmitt’s sketch became the basis forthe Testors Model Company’s plastic model kit of the Roswell craft:image [images/00019.jpg] Testors Model Kit Diagram of the Roswell Craft from its Instruction Manual (Notethe Painting Color Schematic Suggested) Whatever the validity or resemblance of Schmitt’s or the Testors kit’sreconstructions to the actual craft may be, their versions are very suggestiveof some very terrestrial designs.M. JESSE MARCEL JR’S HIEROGLYPHICS In the same class of pictorial details that become part of the revisionistscenario, Randle and Schmitt persuaded Jesse Marcel Jr., M.D., to undergoregressive hypnosis to see if he could recall and draw the shapes of thehieroglyphic pictograms he and his father saw on some of the Roswell debris.98image [images/00020.jpg] Jesse Marcel Jr’s Hand-drawn Heiroglyphics, Drawn under Hypnosis99 Whether or not these symbols represent something terrestrial or extraterrestrialremains to be seen, but they do constitute the only pictorial basis on which torationalize a possibly explanation.B. TAKING ACCOUNT OF “ALL THE EVIDENCE” So what does one have at the end of this outline of the revisionist scenario?It is best to let its principal exponents, Randle and Schmitt, state the case intheir own words:> In short, no mundane explanation works. A (black projects) craft classified as> top secret in 1947 would no longer be classified today…> Balloons, practice atomic bombs, experimental aircraft, and Soviet spy planes> cannot have been responsible for the debris discovered by Mac Brazel. No> alternative, nonextraordinary hypotheses account for the strange metals with> strange properties described by the men and women who handled them. No> evidence attests to the presence of a balloon, a practice bomb, or an> experimental aircraft. Such explanations have one fatal fact in common: an> utter absence of supporting evidence.100Note the clever word-craft and the tendentiousness of these remarks, for anyterrestrial explanation has been reduced to the “mundane” and“non-extraordinary.” And there is a hidden logic at work here, one which Randleand Schmitt explicitly state: any top secret project could not be advancedenough to be kept secret this long.But this merely assumes two things: firstly, that no human technological advancecan be decades in advance of the public knowledge — a dubious assumption atbest, and, as will become evident in Part Three, a fallacious one as well.However, their remarks also assume that such technological prowess would be theonly conceivable rational explanation for keeping things covered-up for so longin a veil and mantle of classification and cover stories, barring anextraterrestrial interpretation. But there are, in fact, other possibilities fordoing so: there could be moral or political reasons for doing so; merely toexclude a technological reason does not logically exhaust all terrestrialpossibilities.Randle and Schmitt, however, will have none of it, for they state their casewith a dangerous extremity and tendentiousness that Berlitz and Moore, andBerliner and Friedman, before them, avoided: “No mundane explanation works.”1. RANDLE AND SCHMITT ON THE DEBRIS, THE BODIES, AND “OTHER EXPLANATIONS” Behind all the witnesses and stories, the Roswell Incident and itsinterpretation is ultimately about two basic datasets: the debris, and thebodies, and Randle’s and Schmitt’s dangerous tendentiousness is even more inevidence with their handling of the summary of the relative weight andconsistency of the testimonies regarding each, and again, they state theiroverall case with a directness, an all-encompassing universality, and sweepingclaim that leaves them little margin for error or maneuver: “When all theevidence is examined, the possibility that Roswell can be explained in themundane drops to zero.”101While Randle and Schmitt argue a convincing case throughout their books that theballoon explanation is inadequate,102 they also point out the obvious fact that“Balloons were used as a cover to eliminate speculation about the identificationof the object that crashed.”103 But whatever its genuine or contrived status maybe, the 2002 Haut Affidavit also makes it clear that the flying saucer story,and by implication the associated “extraterrestrial” origin of it, is logicallyconceivable as a cover story in itself. In short, “extraterrestrials” canfunction every bit as nicely as a “cover to eliminate speculation about theidentification of the object that crashed” as balloons can.As for the crash of an American black project, Randle and Schmitt point out theobvious difficulty of this explanation as well: “What sort of experimentalaircraft was being tested in New Mexico… at night… during a storm? Again, thereare no records available anywhere that attest to any type of balloon experimentor experimental aircraft test late on the evening of July 4.”104 Indeed, theyare correct, for the logic of such a test, at night, during a storm, makes nosense. What crashed could not have been American. And this brings them back tothe two essential datasets any theory of the Roswell Incident must rationalize:the debris, and the bodies.Concerning the debris, however, again Randle and Schmitt make some very sweepingclaims:> There were three types of debris that were consistently described by the> witnesses. First, by far the most common, was the foil that was thicker than> normal aluminum foil, more like a lead foil. But unlike either of those, this> foil, when folded or wadded into a ball, would unfold itself, with no sign of> a crease. Among the witnesses to the foil are Bill Brazel, Frankie Rowe,> Robert Smith, Sallye Tadolini, and Jim Ragsdale.> Second, Bill Brazel talked of the lightweight material that reminded him of> balsa wood but that was so strong that it couldn’t be cut. Loretta Proctor> handled something with similar properties. Rickett, Marcel, Easley, Boldra,> Kromschroeder, and W.E. Lounsbury talked of lightweight material “as thin as> newsprint” that couldn’t be bent or marked.> Finally, there were the wirelike pieces that Bill Brazel described as> flexible. He said that he could shine a light in one end and it would come out> the other no matter how he twisted the wire around. This sounds suspiciously> like fiber optics.> These are the eyewitnesses who saw or handled the debris found on either the> debris field or the impact site — dozens of people who saw the material and> who describe it in the same terms over and over. These remains are not the> stuff of balloons, experimental aircraft, or rockets….> The point is that no such material exists today. There are, after a fashion,> molecules with a memory… (Hmmm!)> …but nothing that can be twisted out of shape and then return to its original> shape when the pressure is released.> The question becomes, who was making material with such strange properties in> 1947? Why isn’t there a hint of that material anywhere today?105 It will be discovered in Part Three that Randle and Schmitt are off by no lessthan fifteen years, for the first such material was in fact discovered in 1932!And that raises the thorny question of what enough money, manpower, and researchmight have been able to accomplish between 1932 and 1947.This tendentiousness regarding the potential technology represented by thedebris is brought into full illumination by a comment that they make in theirprevious book:> If (Major Jesse Marcel Sr) had somehow been fooled by mundane wreckage picked> up under extraordinary circumstances, Blanchard, or one of his staff, would> have been able to identify it. Certainly, before they announced to the world> they had a flying saucer, they would have made sure that it couldn’t be> explained by the mundane.106 But in “seeking to explain all the facts” Randle and Schmitt seem to haveforgotten that their explanation does not encompass all the logicalpossibilities, for it is equally possible that Marcel and Blanchard did havesuspicions about the origin of the debris, and, as the 2002 Haut Affidavitlogically suggests, contrived a cover story to deflect attention and speculationaway from consideration of possible terrestrial sources.This makes their following comment even more interesting:> The unusual qualities of the material described to date by fourteen known> eyewitnesses are consistent in every detail. In appearance, tensile strength,> apparent weightlessness, memory characteristics, uninterpretable symbology,> and plastic-like, metal-like composition, its physical makeup would be> difficult to duplicate even by today’s standards.107 But “difficult” is not “impossible,” especially if one of those allegedcharacteristics, the memory characteristic, was, as alluded to above, firstdiscovered in 1932, and given a great deal of money and research to investigate.2. COLONEL BLANCHARD’S STRANGE REMARK TO HIS WIFE In this respect it is also worth noting what Randle and Schmitt themselvesrecord about Colonel Blanchard’s first reaction to the material:> Colonel William Blanchard (commander of the 509th Bomb Group), Major Jesse A.> Marcel (the air intelligence officer), and a man in civilian clothes (a> counter-intelligence agent) responded to the sheriff’s call. According to> Phyllis McGuire, daughter of the sheriff, the military arrived almost as soon> as the sheriff had hung up the phone. The officers interviewed Brazel,> examined some pieces of the material, and then Blanchard ordered Marcel and> the CIC man to accompany Brazel to the ranch.> Blanchard, sure that he was in possession of something unusual, alerted the> next higher headquarters. According to Blanchard’s first wife, Ethyl, he> thought that they might have found something that belonged to the Soviets. No> one mentioned any type of balloon.108 And no one was mentioning an extraterrestrial craft either, for obviously,something “Soviet” implies something terrestrial. Time and again we are remindedby the proponents of the extraterrestrial explanation of the Roswell Incidentthat Blanchard and Marcel and others of the 509th Bomb Group were members of theonly atomic bomb group in the world at that time, and that they were allhand-picked, highly trained officers, and that we should trust their judgments.The same holds equally true, therefore, for Blanchard’s first instincts that hewas holding something not only highly unusual and exotic, but very terrestrial.3. THE PATHOLOGY OF A METHODOLOGY: THE PRIMACY OF THE BODIES All of this brings us, finally, to what is the real centerpiece of theirargument that the Roswell Incident was something extraterrestrial and unearthly,whose origins were “not of this world.” Randle and Schmitt state that “Witnessdescriptions” of the bodies “make it clear that they were neither human noranimal.”109 But as is by now abundantly clear from the numerous citations theirown witnesses has demonstrated, time and again they describe the bodies as“children,” or “ten-year-old children,” or “midgets,” occasionally addingdetails such as large heads, small mouths, slender fragile bodies, and so on. Inshort, there is nothing about these details compelling to the conclusion thatthe bodies were in fact those of extraterrestrials. In only one instance, thatof Melvin Brown, is there a detail that does persuasively suggest anextraterrestrial origin: that of “yellowish-orange” skin that was leathery andbeaded, like a lizard’s skin. Thus, notwithstanding the fact that most of thewitnesses to the bodies are from the same military as was putting out stories ofrecovered flying saucers and crashed weather balloons,110 their descriptions ofthe bodies’ physiological characteristics are also remarkably consistent.111So what is the importance of the bodies vis-à-vis the debris? It is the sameprimacy of bodies over debris that was encountered in our examination ofBerliner and Friedman’s articulation of the Incident: “The debris itself couldbe explained in an ordinary way. Metal was metal and wires were wires, even ifthat metal and those wires seemed to be extraordinary. Bodies, however, couldnot be explained so easily.”112 It comes back, once more, to bodies:> What we are left with, then, is a large body of eyewitness testimony to the> high strangeness of the debris. Thin metal of extraordinary strength; foil> that unfolds itself, assuming its original shape; strands of “wire” that sound> like fiber optics; and I beams that flex. No one has been able to discover a> single example of this material from that time frame. The properties described> are unique.> While it is true there are always rumors of classified materials that can> match those descriptions, when the conversation turns to the bodies, the> debate ends. There is no way to explain them.113 Poppycock and balderdash. There are certainly terrestrial explanations for largeheads, small bodies, and their midget-like child-like appearance. The only thingreally with which we must contend is that one detail — beady yellowish orangelizard-like skin — of one witness, Melvin Brown.All the rest, as will eventually be seen, is “rationalizable” on a terrestrialbasis.What Randle and Schmitt’s pathological methodology actually exposes is the fact— perhaps one might even say the intuition or suspicion — among extraterrestrialproponents of the Roswell Incident that the technology is not exotic norcompelling enough to be extraterrestrial. They have consequently had to exaltthe exotic status of the bodies to mythical, extraterrestrial proportions.In doing so, they have made a critical, strategic, error fatal to their case.image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Kevin D.

The first simplyexamines the various claims, subjects the adduced witnesses to close vetting andscrutiny, and challenges the basic assumptions underpinning that interpretation.The second does all this, but also goes on to propose its own terrestrialexplanation of the Incident, usually by proposing very mundane solutions, suchas resurrecting the U.S. Army Air Force’s own balloon explanation, this timedressed up in new Mogul balloon clothing and the latest “official” explanation.In surveying the skeptical response to the claims of a crashed extraterrestrialcraft at Roswell in 1947, we shall concentrate on the second type, and its twomost capable, and indeed formidable proponents, Kal Korff, and Karl Pflock.3Both men subject the Roswell story — both in its standard Berlitz-Moore andBerliner-Friedman, and in its revisionist Randle-Schmitt versions — to acritical analysis, and offer in turn a very plausible, very terrestrial, and inthe end, very mundane interpretation.A. KAL KORFF1. AND THE WITNESSES As already noted in previous chapters, many of the “hundreds of witnesses” tothe Roswell Incident are in fact second-hand witnesses presenting hearsaytestimony, often of things they heard from other people, who are in turn dead.As Kal. Korff observes, this number is “at first impressive,”4 but as he alsoastutely observes, “the relevant issue is not how many witnesses wereinterviewed but rather what type of witnesses (i.e., firsthand, secondhand,etc.) these people are and how truthful and accurate their statements are.”5When this problem is examined in detail and then compared with the actualnumbers of witnesses, yet another problem begins to emerge for any presentationof the Roswell Incident, whether the “standard scenario” of Berlitz and Moore,and Berliner and Friedman, or the “revisionist scenario of Randle, Schmitt, andCarey:> Unfortunately, a careful reading of Moore and Berlitz’s Roswell Incident> reveals that despite the impressive claim of having “interviewed more than> seventy witnesses,” the testimonies of just twenty-five people are presented.> Out of these twenty-five, only seven of them are firsthand sources who claim> to have seen the alleged saucer debris, and one of these accounts is suspect.> Of these seven people, however, only five of them claim to have actually> handled the material personally and one of them is adamant that it was not> from an extraterrestrial spacecraft.6 Though it is not mentioned by Korff, some of the testimony concerningdescriptions of “alien” bodies comes from witnesses whose credibility has beenimpeached, as was seen in the previous chapter in the case of Glenn Dennis’story of his nurse friend. In any case, Korff notes that such secondhandtestimony would not be admissible in an American court of law.7With these general observations in hand, Korff turns to an examination ofcertain crucial features in the Roswell Incident. It should be noted that asboth Korff and Pflock cover many of these same incidents in the same manner, inorder to avoid duplication, I shall concentrate on certain incidents in eachcase when summarizing each researcher’s individual findings, with the exceptionsof Frank Kaufman and Jim Ragsdale, two key “witnesses” in the emergence of the“revisionist scenario.”A. THE “COLLAPSE” OF THE LYDIA SLEPPY “INTERRUPTED TELETYPE” STORY As has already been detailed, Berliner and Friedman maintain that whenAlbuquerque radio station KOAT employee Lydia Sleppy was attempting to transmitthe Roswell story over the wire, the transmission was abruptly halted by theFBI, which ordered her to stop transmission. “Friedman,” notes Korff, “claimsthis came as no surprise, ‘in view of all the classified work that was going onat that time.’”8Deciding to check the details of this story, Korff contacted the FBIheadquarters in Washington, D.C. as well as the FBI field office in Dallas,Texas. What Korff learned from both offices was that there was no such system ofmonitoring any news transmissions in place at that time.9 More importantly,Korff learned that the particular teletype machine she used at that time “hadboth send and receive capabilities. This discovery seemed to initially supportthe feasibility of Sleppy’s story.”10 However, according to Korffin order forSleppy to have received any incoming message, a bell on the teletype machinewould have rung to inform her that a transmission was incoming. She would “haveto have then thrown a manual switch to put the teletype machine into the‘receive’ mode!”11 But Sleppy claimed in her story that “she was on the phonewith reporter Johnny McBoyle at the time of the alleged transmission.”12 Korffseems to be implying that Sleppy could not be on the phone and flip the manualteletype switch at the same time. If so, then, to this author, this seems alittle far-fetched.But Korff’s main point remains: according to the FBI itself, it had no suchsystem in place at that time to monitor any news transmissions over the presswires. His conclusion is sharp and direct: “Although conspiracy buffs will nodoubt cry ‘cover-up,’ the burden of proof remains on their shoulders. Until suchevidence is forthcoming, the statements made by the FBI must stand.”13 Strictlyspeaking, this is quite true.14B. THE COLLAPSE OF THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JOSEPH MONTOYA STORY One of the salient features of the “revisionist scenario” was the allegation ofRuben Anaya, close friend of then New Mexico Lieutenant Governor Joseph Montoya,later a U.S. Congressman and finally a U.S. Senator from that state. As was seenin the previous chapter, Anaya claimed to have picked up Montoya at the RoswellAir base, later learning that Montoya maintained he saw wreckage and strangebodies.Korff notes that the principal difficulty with Anaya’s story is that there areno records that Lieutenant Governor Montoya travelled anywhere in the earlyweeks of July 1947,15 but remained in the state’s capital, Santa Fe.Additionally, the Roswell air base’s official visitors logs for the entire monthof July 1947 reveal that Montoya did not visit the base.16C. THE COLLAPSE OF THE MELVIN BROWN STORY As has been seen, the story of Sergeant Melvin Brown is another key item in theRoswell Incident, since Brown described rather different characteristics for the“aliens” allegedly recovered at Roswell, describing them as having lizard-likebeady, leathery, and yellowish-orange skin. Korff points out firstly that, likeso many other Roswell witnesses, Brown’s testimony is not firsthand.17 All ofthe details Brown allegedly described came “from only one source: his daughter,Beverly Bean,”18 who first related them, two years after her father’s death, toBritish UFO researcher Timothy Good in 1988. She then repeated her story toStanton “Friedman in 1989, and (to) Randle and Schmitt in 1990 and 1991.”19 Thelatter two authors, moreover, utilized what may best be considered “journalisticlicense” according to Korff:> Moreover, in what are blatant examples of what I will politely call> journalistic license, Randle and Schmitt write phrases in their books such as> “Brown said that (the crate) had been prepared for shipment (of the alien> bodies) out that night” and “According to him (Brown), (the aliens) were> smaller than human and had a skin that was yellowish-orange and like that of a> lizard, meaning it was leathery and beaded, but not scaly.”> Obviously, since Brown was never interviewed by anyone and had died roughly> four years before Randle and Schmitt were told about his purported “remarks”> from his daughter, one does not know with any certainty that “Brown said”> anything, contrary to what the authors claim.> Indeed, a more honest way for Randle and Schmitt to convey Brown’s alleged> testimony in their books would have been to preface their dogmatic> declarations with simple phrases such as “According to Beverly Bean, Brown’s> daughter, he said….” Instead, Randle and Schmitt’s presentation, as written,> is misleading if not followed carefully by the discerning reader.20Nor are Berliner and Friedman exempt from the practice of using “journalisticlicense,” for when they introduce the testimony of Brown, they “start by saying‘Another man who saw bodies was Sgt. Melvin E. Brown….’”21Then what of Brown’s daughter, Beverly Bean herself? Is she a crediblesecondhand source of information?> Do her comments constitute credible evidence for the presence of alieans in> the Roswell stewpot of claims? Unfortunately, there are problems with several> aspects of Bean’s various accounts which cast doubt on their veracity. Like so> many other so-called witnesses to Roswell, Bean has changed her story over the> years.22 When first interviewed by British researcher Timothy Good, Bean claimed that herfather first informed her about having been involved with the shipment of alienbodies after reading an article about Roswell in the British tabloid The DailyMail. Later, however, when interviewed by Stanton Friedman,> Bean told a significantly different story. Instead of her father having first> told her about his involvement with the recovery of the aliens after reading> the article in the Daily Mail, Bean told Friedman: “when we were young, he> (Brown) used to tell us stories about things that had happened to him when he> was young. We got to know those stories by heart and would all say together,> ‘Here we go again!’”> “Sometimes, but not too often, he used to say that he saw a man from outer> space. That used to make us all giggle like mad.”23 But that was not the end of the saga. When interviewed by Randle and Schmitt,Bean changed her story yet again, maintaining that her father had first toldthem that he had seen aliens at Roswell while they were watching the Apollo moonlandings in 1969.24There’s more.Brown’s military records indicated that his duties while he was stationed at theRoswell air base “were limited to that of being a cook.”25 Brown was neverinvolved in any intelligence or counter-intelligence duties, making it highlyunlikely> That Melvin Brown would have been chosen to carry out the all-important task> of “escorting” the recovered extraterrestrials back to the base at Roswell. Of> the thousands of personnel stationed at Roswell Army Air Field in 1947, there> were simply too many others who would have been chosen for this task.26 This author concurs with the implications of Korff’s argument: Beverly Bean’stestimony is simply not credible, and therefore, the whole Melvin Browndescription of the alleged aliens must be discounted. Indeed, as Korff observes,Brown’s (or rather, Bean’s) description of the dead aliens is entirelyinconsistent with all other descriptions by Roswell “witnesses.”27 Since theentire story of Melvin Brown now stands as lacking credibility, this means oneis left with the basic description of the bodies as being small, humanoid, withlarge heads and eyes, small mouths, bald, hairless, and so on. And, as alreadynoted, these details are not sufficient to compel to the conclusion that thebodies — if indeed there were any — were of extraterrestrial origin.D. THE COLLAPSE OF THE GLENN DENNIS STORY As noted in the previous chapter, not even revisionist scenario proponents andRoswell “true believers” Thomas Carey and Donald Schmitt any longer accept GlennDennis’ story of the nurse, and her description of the bodies. As his entirestory — and therewith its secondhand description of dead aliens by the nurse —now stands impeached even among the revisionists, we simply note that Korff’smain difficulty with Dennis’ story is precisely its changing, ever-embellisheddetails over time,28 and that his own efforts to track down the alleged nursemet with similar difficulties as other researchers.29E. THE COLLAPSE OF THE FRANK KAUFMANN STORY Two of the key “witnesses” in the revisionist scenario were Frank Kaufmann andJim Ragsdale, and accordingly, both Korff’s and Pflock’s analysis of theirtestimonies will be summarized here. In Korff’s presentation there areessentially four problems to Kaufman: firstly, Kaufman is not “universallyendorsed” as a credible witness by researchers advocating the extraterrestrialinterpretation of the Incident; secondly, Randle and Schmitt actually presentedKaufman in their two books as three entirely different people; thirdly, Kaufman,by his own statements, appears to have been involved at nearly every crucialmoment of the Roswell Incident; and finally, there are too many internalcontradictions in Kaufman’s story.(1) KAUFMAN’S LACK OF “UNIVERSAL ENDORSEMENT” Korff notes that, according to Randle and Schmitt, “Kaufman is the centralcharacter in what took place and is ‘Roswell’s’ most important witness.”30 WhileKaufman may be, for Randle and Schmitt, the witness with top billing on theRoswell marquee, Friedman does not view Kaufman as a credible witness.31(2) RANDLE AND SCHMITT’S PRESENTATION OF KAUFMAN AS THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE Korff notes that one of the biggest problems in the Kaufmann story was in therather disingenuous manner in which Randle and Schmitt chose to present it:> In what is a somewhat misleading and downright confusing portrayal, Randle and> Schmitt in their two books present Kaufmann as three different people! Using> various names that Randle made up (literally), such as Joseph Osborn and Frank> MacKenzie, the authors present the numerous accounts of Kaufmann and weave> them throughout their narrative as if they’re the actions of separate people.> In truth, it’s all Frank Kaufmann as the source.32 Note that the tale of Frank MacKenzie being assigned to a special “radar watch”of the New Mexico UFOs is in fact Frank Kaufmann! But why would Randle andSchmitt resort to such a tactic? One answer is that by doing so, Kaufmann’stales might be rendered more palatable.(3) KAUFMAN’S APPEARANCE AT NEARLY EVERY CRITICAL JUNCTURE OF THE ROSWELL STORY Korff hints at this possibility in a witty passage that suggests that Kaufmanhimself — not Major Jesse Marcel, not Colonel Blanchard, not Max Brazel orGeneral Ramey nor even General Nathan Twining — is at the center of the Roswellmaelstrom, at least, according to Kaufmann:> Frank Kaufman has the distinction of being the only “witness” to have> participated in virtually every aspect of the Roswell incident. He observed> the UFO on radar as a member of a secret military elite unit. He was there> observing on the radar screen the very moment the UFO crashed and its location> was triangulated. Kaufman was ordered out to the crash site where he saw both> the spaceship and five dead extraterrestrials. But wait, there’s more! Frank> Kaufman was a privileged member of an elite UFO recovery team, “The Unholy> 13,” that still exists today!> UFO researcher Karl Pflock has written extensively about the ongoing saga and> tales of Frank Kaufman. To put it politely, they are voluminous: a whole book> could be written about them and nothing else. Kaufman can show you drawings of> both the craft and the aliens. He can also tell you which technologies of> modern science are a direct result of reverse-engineering the technology of> the crashed UFO. Kaufman can also show you still-classified and secret> government documents concerning Roswell. Kaufman can sketch out various> components of the inner workings of the saucer. Dubbed by writer Arthur S.> Levine as the “Zelig of Roswell,” Kaufman has literally seen and done it> all.33As Korff notes, Kaufman-”MacKenzie’s” story about being present at a secretradar tracking assignment of the UFO makes no sense, since the radar sets of1947 were too primitive to detect an object being struck by lightning andballooning on the radar screen like an explosion.34 The other major difficultywith his radar story is simply that the radar set at White Sands at the timesimply did not have the range to track any object near Roswell, thus making hisclaimed triangulation impossible.35(4) TOO MANY INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS As if that were not enough, Kaufman, in his pseudonym guise as “FrankMacKenzie,” claimed to have been assigned to his secret radar duty by GeneralScanlon, which was, of course, in 1947. However, “Kaufman would later admit thathe was discharged from the service in 1945, some two years before!”36 To put itbluntly, Kaufman’s 37 imaginative stories are “just not credible.”37 Hisstatements cannot be accepted as credible, and with that, another “witness” tothe recovery of “alien bodies” disappears.F. JIM RAGSDALE AND THE GOLDEN HELMETS Jim Ragsdale, another crucial “witness” for the revisionist scenario, suffersfrom the same credibility problem as so many others: an ever-evolving andembellished story. Initially, it will be recalled, Ragsdale claimed to have comeupon the primary crash site with his companion, Trudy Truelove, and seen bodiesscattered around the craft.38> However, over the next few months Ragsdale began to tell a more elaborate> story of having actually gone down to the hull of the spaceship, where he now> said there were four bodies. Not stopping there, Ragsdale started claiming> that he had gotten close to the bodies and even tried unsuccessfully to remove> a helmet from one of the aliens. Indeed, before Ragsdale died, his tale had> grown to include the claim that he had removed eleven gold helmets and had> buried them in the desert. Of course, these valuable helmets have never been> found.39 In a nutshell, Ragsdale’s credibility as a witness is just not believable, andhis stories must be discounted. And with that, another “witness” to the recoveryof “alien bodies” goes by the wayside.40G. THE ROWE STORY AND THE ROSWELL FIRE DEPARTMENT According to the revisionist scenario, Frankie Rowe stated that her father, afireman with the Roswell Fire Department, responded to a call to the site somethirty miles north of the city. The problem is, “there are no records anywhereindicating that the Roswell Fire Department made a run outside of town anytimeduring the month of July 1947!”41 As Korff also perceptively observes, theRoswell Fire Department at that time had only two trucks available, and hence itseldom dispatched them outside the city, since this would leave the townunprotected.42 The second major problem with Frankie Rowe’s story is that iffire trucks were needed at the site, it would have been highly unlikely that themilitary would have called a civilian fire department, when it had its own suchpersonnel and equipment on the airbase. Involving a civilian fire department ina supposedly top secret operation makes no sense.43 In short, Frankie Rowe’sstory “does not hold up under critical evaluation. Until evidence emerges thatsupports her claims, her account must be considered highly suspect.”44H. COLONEL BLANCHARD’S LEAVE Both in the standard and revisionist scenarios, there are two events that figurelarge in the interpretation of the Roswell Incident as an extraterrestrialincident: Colonel Blanchard’s “sudden leave” on the evening of July 8, andGeneral Nathan Twining’s “sudden change of schedule” from a visit to the Boeingplant in Seattle, to a trip to New Mexico. It will be recalled that GeneralTwining was the commander of the Air Material Command, based in Dayton, Ohio, atWright Field.In both scenarios, these events are understood to reflect the gravity of thesituation, with Colonel Blanchard’s leave being a cover for his personal visitto the crash site, and with Twining’s appearance in New Mexico being for thepurpose of coordinating the initial analysis of the debris, its transfer toWright Field for more in depth analysis, and coordination of the ensuingcover-up.However, Korff notes that researcher Robert Todd uncovered serious discrepanciesto the “Roswell conspiracy” version of Colonel Blanchard’s leave. Citing Todd’sown research, the July 15th edition of the Albuquerque Journal noted that onJuly 14th, Lieutenant Governor Joseph Montoya decreed that August 1st would be“Air Force Day,” commemorating the 40th anniversary of the establishment of theArmy Air Force.45 Montoya was at that time “Acting Governor” as New MexicoGovernor Malory was preparing to attend a conference. But Todd also noted thatthe same newspaper story mentioned that Colonel Blanchard was present when thedecree was made by Montoya. The Roswell Army Air base’s own base newspaper alsoshowed a picture of Blanchard with Montoya at his desk in the state capital atSanta Fe signing the decree in its July 25th edition.46Citing a communication from acting Roswell air base commander, LieutenantColonel Payne Jennings that explicitly stated that Blanchard was going on leaveto meet with Governor Mabry on July 9th to coordinate the proclamation of AirForce Day,47 Todd concludes, from all this information, that Blanchard may havebeen in Santa Fe from July 9th to July 14th when Acting Governor Joseph Montoyasigned the decree.48While all this is very suggestive, it is not, in my opinion, entirelypersuasive, since we do not know for a certainty that Blanchard was in Santa Feon July 9th. He could have arrived in New Mexico’s state capital on any day fromthe 9th through the 14th itself. Needless to say, this leaves open thepossibility suggested both by standard and by revisionist scenario authors thatBlanchard’s leave may indeed have been in part a cover story in order for him tocoordinate personally whatever operation may have been taking place north ofRoswell, assuming that such an operation was indeed taking place.I. GENERAL NATHAN TWINING’S SCHEDULE CHANGE As noted above, the other major event that Roswell Incident proponents adduce insupport of its extraordinary nature is the sudden schedule change of the AirMaterials Command commander, General Nathan Twining, from a scheduled visit toBoeing’s Seattle plant, to a flight into Alamogordo on July 7, 1947. This suddenschedule change, they argue, is further testimony to the extraordinary nature ofthe event. But Korff will have none of it:> According to a now-declassified document dated June 5, 1947 from Army Air> Force Headquarters in Washington, D.C., and written to the commanding general,> Air Material Command, a request was made that confidential orders be issued> that would place Lt. Gen. Twining and others on three-day temporary duty> status at Sandia Base, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The purpose of thie request> was so that Twining could attend the “Bomb Commanders Course,” which was> scheduled to begin on July 8. The document also reveals that other> high-powered brass such as Maj. Gen. Benjamin W. Childlaw, Brig. Gen. Samuel> C. Brentnall, and Brig. Arthur Thomas were also signed up to attend the same> course.> Visitors logs and secretaries calendars prove conclusively that Generals> Twining, Childlaw, Brentnall, and Thomas all took the three-day course, which> lasted through July 11 — the very same window that the pro-UFO Roswell authors> would have us believe that an extraterrestrial spacecraft was being> recovered!...> It stands to reason that if an actual alien ship and its crew had been> recovered near Roswell, one would expect that the schedules of at least one of> these generals, especially that of Nathan Twining, would have been affected.> Instead, the generals proceeded with their scheduled training and commanders> [sic] course because in reality no flying saucer had been recovered!49This is indeed a telling argument and one which, to my knowledge, has not beenanswered by the Roswell “ET proponents.”That being said, however, it does not in and of itself preclude the possibilitythat something extraordinary may have happened at Roswell, for it is entirelypossible that, not knowing at that juncture what had crashed nor where it wasfrom, the Army Air Force deemed that it was more important for the generals tomaintain their schedule and attend the course, leaving Twining to deal with theextraordinary event after further analysis could be done on whatever wasrecovered, and after he had returned to his command at Wright Field. This, aswill be seen in Part Three, is a plausible interpretation.2. AND THE DEBRISA. THE DEBRIS AND THE ORIGINAL WITNESSES(1) PROCTOR PROBLEMS Both in the standard and in the revisionist scenarios, rancher Mac Brazel firstwent to his neighbors, Floyd and Loretta Proctor, with some of the debris, andattempted to get them to come to his ranch to see the debris field forthemselves. Loretta Proctor described the debris in 1990 as a tan, light-brownplastic like material like balsa wood. She maintained that they also tried tocut it and burn it, without success.50 But according to Korff, like so manyother Roswell witnesses, Loretta Proctor’s story changed over time, forapproximately one year earlier, she was directly asked if she had ever tried toburn the material, or do anything else with it. Her answer? She had not.51This is not the only problem with her story, for as Korff also observes, thereis a question whether or not she ever actually saw any of the debris, for in herinterview with William Moore in 1979 she “made no mention at all of ever havingpersonally seen any of the debris Brazel claimed had fallen on the Fosterranch.”52 In fact, as Korff makes clear, her husband Floyd, when interviewed byMoore, never made any statement to the effect that he had seen any of the debriseither. Quite the opposite, for as Berlitz’s and Moore’s book The RoswellIncident explicitly reveals, it was Mac Brazel himself who described thematerial to the Proctors. Indeed, in that articulation of the Incident, Brazelmerely informed them of the fact that the debris could not be cut. There was nomention of its inability to be burnt.53Korff correctly concludes that Loretta Proctor’s testimony should only beaccepted when it agrees with that of her late husband. Moreover, as he alsocorrectly notes, nothing in the details of the debris as originally describedcompel to the conclusion that what Mac Brazel had recovered was indeedextraterrestrial.54(2) BILL BRAZEL, BESSIE BRAZEL SCHREIBER AND KORFF’S ANALYSIS Noting discrepancies between Bill Brazel’s original timeline of the Army AirForce’s confiscation of the debris he had found on his father’s ranch asrecounted to William Moore and Stanton Friedman,55 Korff observes that “thereare other issues with Brazel Jr.’s account concerning the purported Air Forcepersonnel” that he encountered.56 In his original account to Moore, Bill Brazelmaintained that one of the Army Air Force officers who had contacted him was a“Captain Armstrong,” yet, there is no record for a Captain Armstrong stationedat the Roswell base between 1947 and 1949.57 Brazel also described encounteringa black sergeant; ? yet once again, there are no records of a black sergeant atthe Roswell base for 1947.58Korff’s conclusions regarding Bill Brazel’s testimony are worth citing in full:> The truth is, a significant portion of Bill Brazel’s testimony muct be> considered suspect. About the only thing we can be reasonably certain of is> that foil-like material, very strong in nature, was recovered. We can assume> that Brazel Yr.’s description of the material is fairly accurate, since it is> consistent with what other witnesses have reported.59 This is a significant statement, as will eventually be seen, for Korff isadmitting that Bill Brazel’s testimony regarding the debris is trustworthy inits details, which include a thin foil with extraordinary strength. The debris,in other words, remains unusual, and thus, one would not associate this type ofmaterial with a Mogul balloon. This point should be borne in mind when we turnto Korff’s exposition of that hypothesis below.In this respect, Korff cites a portion of Bill Brazel’s sister’s, Bessie BrazelSchreiber’s, description of the debris:> There was what appeared to be pieces of heavily waxed paper and a sort of> aluminum-like foil. Some of these pieces had something like numbers and> lettering on them, but there were no words that we were able to make out. Some> of the metal-foil pieces had a sort of tape stuck to them, and when these were> held to the light they showed what looked like pastel flowers or designs. Even> though the stuff looked like tape it could not be peeled off or removed at> all. It was very light in weight but there sure was a lot of it.60 From this Korff concludes that the materials Bill Brazel’s sister describes areconsistent with those of other witnesses: “aluminum-like foil, wax paper, tapewith flowers or pastel designs on it, and some writing.”61 Of course, none ofthis leads or compels to the conclusion that the debris’ origin wasextraterrestrial. It does suggest, according to Korff, “that whatever the devicewas, it consisted of manmade materials.”62 There, however, Korff leaves it, butthe fact of the matter remains, that while the debris may be terrestrial, thinfoil-like material that cannot be torn or cut are qualities do not resemble anymaterial used in the proposed “latest official explanation” and the favoredinterpretation of the skeptical Roswell community, the Mogul balloon.B. “ART’S PARTS” The famous talk show host, Art Bell, former host of the nationwide “Coast toCoast AM” and “Dreamland” radio talk shows, received a letter on April 18, 1996,from “an anonymous individual who claimed to be serving in the U.S. military andwhose father was part of the secret ‘recovery team’ at Roswell.”63 Along withthe first letter “were pieces of metal said to be some of the actualextraterrestrial material collected by the military.”64 This material wasquickly dubbed “Art’s Parts.” Bell arranged for the materials to bescientifically tested, and on May 19, 1996, Bell hosted paranormal and UFOresearcher Linda Moulton Howe, who reported on the findings.65 According toKorff,> (The) electron dispersion spectroscopy revealed that some of the samples were> almost pure aluminum. The other items, various odd-shaped pieces of metal,> consisted of silicon granules (i.e., sand), iron, manganese, calcium, bismuth,> and zinc.> Nowhere, among any of the samples Art Bell had received, was there any> indication that the items were extraterrestrial in nature or had not been> manufactured on Earth.66But this does not tell the whole story. While the material may have beenterrestrial, it was nevertheless unusual, as Linda Moulton Howe herself makesvery clear:> April 28, 2006 Harvest, Alabama - Ten years ago in 1996, I was investigating> strange metal of alternating layers of bismuth and a magnesium/zinc alloy> allegedly taken in 1947 from the bottom of a “wedge-shaped extraterrestrial> vehicle.” Several pieces of the layered metal had been shipped to Art Bell,> then radio host of Dreamland and Coast to Coast AM for which I was reporting.> To this day, that layered metal is a mystery and so far has never been> duplicated. > One scientist who helped me in my investigation was Travis Taylor, Ph.D. and> optical physicist, who worked at the Army Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville,> Alabama.> Alleged extraterrestrial metal taken from the bottom of a “wedge-shaped craft> in 1947” was created from alternating layers of 1-4 microns dark bismuth and> 100-200 microns silver magnesium/zinc alloy, approximately twenty-five to> thirty layers thick. Each of six pieces received were “formed” with a> curvature that tapered.67If genuine, then “Art’s Parts” were indeed unusual and even somewhat exotic.But there were two further problems, as Korff pointed out. Firstly, it could notbe assumed that the “parts” were indeed from the Roswell Incident, since therewas no chain of evidence connecting them to Roswell.68 Secondly, the samplesBell received from his anonymous “benefactor” did not resemble in any way thedebris as described by Marcel, Bill Brazel and Bessie Schreiber Brazel or,indeed, any other witness’ description of it:> None of the samples bore any resemblance to the thin, lightweight aluminum> foil-like metal that Jesse Marcel and others claimed would straighten itself> right back out after being folded up. Instead, all of the metallic specimens> Bell had received were hard, sharp pieces of metal…some of which were as thick> as four millimeters.69 “Art’s Parts” thus failed to fulfill the expectations of the Roswell UFOproponents, not only for the insufficiency of their chemical composition tocompel to any extraterrestrial interpretation, but more importantly, becausethey did not resemble any actual descriptions of the debris, and theirprovenance and connection to the Roswell Incident could not be established.C. THE BLAKE LARSEN DEBRIS HOAX However, there was more alleged Roswell debris that turned up, this time at theRoswell International UFO Museum and Research Center, which received a piece ofmetal from Blake Larsen. The museum made arrangements to test the metalscientifically, paying for the analysis out of its own funds. The crucial testwas mass spectroscopy ratio analysis, and this will require some explanation.While the same chemical elements can be found on various planets, each planetwill bear its own template or signature of the relative percentages of thepresence of various isotopes of any given element that would be present in asample of that element. For example, a sample of copper from the Earth mighthave “x” percentage of the copper isotope Cu-63, while a similar copper samplefrom another planet might have “x+y” percentage of the same isotope present inits sample.Blake Larsen’s alleged Roswell debris was tested by this method at the LosAlamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. A control sample was tested, revealinga Cu-63 isotope reading of 69.174 percent, while in Larsen’s samples, theisotopic ratio of Cu-63 was found to be 69.174 and 69.120 percent.70 In otherwords, the difference was not significant enough to indicate that the Larsensample came from anywhere else other than the Earth itself.Various media, including the Albuquerque Journal reported the results along withpictures of a Larsen fragment, and a local jewelry artist, Randy Fullbright ofSt. George, Utah, recognized the piece as one of his own creations.71 Fullbrighthad given the piece to a gallery owner who in turn had given it to Larsen,telling Larsen that it was from Roswell and was found in 1947. Korff noted thatthe museum had spent $725 “of its own money to analyze the fragment for isotopiccontent alone,” and that the episode had cost “innocent, well-intendingindividuals their money and their valuable time.”72D. KORFF’S SUMMARY OF THE DEBRIS In the end, neither episode advanced — or for that matter, hindered -the causeof the Roswell debris, for after all the elimination of non-credible“witnesses,” even skeptic Korff had to conclude that the debris elements of theRoswell Incident remained more or less intact, and that it still consisted ofthe following eight elements:> 1. An object scattered debris over the Foster ranch. Some of this debris was> collected and turned over to the military authorities by William “Mac” Brazel.> However, there is no way to know exactly when Brazel found the debris, as> accounts vary.> 2. The debris consisted, in part, of aluminum foil-like material. The> substance was hard to tear, would straighten itself out when folded up, and> could not be burnt.> 3. There were dark beams of what appeared to be a balsa-like wood. This wood> could not be burned and had strange “hieroglyphic”-type writing on it, as did> some of the pieces of foil-like material.> 4. The strange symbols observed were pink or pastel in color and were not> readable.> 5. The debris included some thread-like material that could not be torn or> broken.> 6. All of the material was very light in weight and very strong.> 7. No one recognized the material or device as anything he or she had seen> before.> 8. The material was originally identified as being the remains of a flying> disc. Later, this same material was “explained” by military authorities as> being from a weather balloon.73 However, Korff is quick to point out two significant implications of this list:> …(As) bizarre as the material described above appears to have been, the> corroborated descriptions fall short of what science demands as sufficient> proof to say that this material was extraterrestrial in origin. We must> remember that two key factors are missing here: (1) No one has ever described> the remains of an intact ship, airborne vehicle, or any sort of fuselage; and> (2) No “alien” bodies were ever described by any of the primary eyewitnesses.> At best we can say that the object and its debris remain unexplained. Indeed,> in order to gain further insight into what it was that scattered debris over> the Foster ranch we need to look at additional testimonies if we are to be> successful.74 Those “additional testimonies” that Korff advances concern the “new balloonhypothesis,” the latest official U.S. Air Force explanation for the RoswellIncident, the Mogul balloon. It remains to be seen if those “additionaltestimonies” can account for all eight bizarre characteristics that Korffenumerated in the quotation cited above.3. AND THE NEW BALLOON HYPOTHESISA. MAJOR MARCEL’S “BAIT AND SWITCH” SCENARIO IN FORT WORTH Major Jesse Marcel consistently maintained up to his death that the debris thatwas originally displayed on the floor of General Ramey’s office in Fort Worthhad been replaced by that of a real weather balloon when he left the office fora few minutes and then returned. Two of the key elements in Korff’s refutationof this claim are an interview conducted by Jamie Shandera — who would gainfurther notoriety for his role in the Majic-12 documents episode75 — and GeneralThomas DuBose, and the Affidavit of the Roswell Army Air Base’scounterintelligence officer during the Roswell Incident, Sheridan Cavitt.B. THE SHANDERA INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL THOMAS DUBOSE, THE TESTIMONY OF WARRANTOFFICER IRVING NEWTON, AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AGENT SHERIDAN CAVITT’S AFFIDAVIT At the time of the Roswell Incident, General Thomas DuBose was a Colonel, and atop aide to Brigadier General Roger Ramey at the Eighth Air Force headquartersin Fort Worth, Texas. DuBose received a telephone call from General ClementsMcMullen in Washington, D.C., ordering him to meet the incoming B-29 fromRoswell when it arrived in Fort Worth. “DuBose not only greeted the incomingplane, but hand carried the wreckage remnants in a sealed canvas mail pouch,immediately escorting it to General Ramey’s office.”76Shandera conducted an interview of General DuBose, in which the latter clearlyand explicitly contradicted Marcel’s “bait and switch” scenario:> (SHANDERA): There are two researchers (Don Schmitt and Kevin Randle) who are> presently saying that the debris in general Ramey’s office had been switched> and that you men had a weather balloon there.> (DUBose): Oh Bull! That material was never switched!> (SHANDERA): So what you’re saying is that the material in General Ramey’s> office was the actual debris brought in from Roswell?> (DUBOSE): That’s absolutely right.> (SHANDERA): Could General Ramey or someone else have ordered a switch without> you knowing it?> (DUBOSE): …I had charge of that material, and it was never switched.77 In other words, according to General DuBose, Major Marcel’s “bait and switch”scenario in Fort Worth never happened.Additionally, according to an affidavit of the Fort Worth Carswell air fieldweatherman, warrant officer Irving Newton, made on July 21, 1994, when orderedby General Ramey to report to his office, Newton stated:> I was met at the General’s office by a Lieutenant Colonel or Colonel DuBose> who told me that someone had found a flying saucer in new Mexico and they had> it in the General’s office. And that a flight had been set up to send it to> Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, but the General suspicioned [sic] that> it might be meteorological equipment of something of that nature and wanted it> examined by qualified meteorological personnel.> The colonel and I walked into the General’s office where this supposed flying> saucer was laying all over the floor. As soon as I saw it, I giggled and asked> if that was the flying saucer. I was told it was.> …> I told them that this was a balloon and a Rawin target. I believed this> because I had seen many of these before.> …> While I was examining the debris, Major Marcel was picking up pieces of the> target sticks and trying to convince me that some notations on the sticks were> alien writings. There were figures on the sticks lavender or pink in color,> appeared to be weather faded markings with no rhyme or reason. He did not> convince me these were alien writings.78 But Korff’s normal analytical acuity momentarily abandons him here, for he doesnot notice the significant discrepancy between his own admissions concerning theunusual nature of the Roswell debris, and Irving’s reaction to it in Fort Worth,for nowhere does Irving - who by his own admission was “examining the debris,”thus implying that he was handling it — ever once mention anything about thinfoil-like material and its unusual properties, which one would expect him to doif, as DuBose stated, the material was taken straight to Ramey’s office in asealed mail bag under his personal escort! In other words, the debris Newton isdescribing would appear to be too ordinary to be the Roswell debris, and thus,Marcel’s original “bait and switch” scenario may in fact be true. Consequently,in this analysis, General DuBose is either lying, or, much more preferably,simply not recalling the events of that day with complete accuracy.But there is another possible way to analyze Newton’s statements, and that is toassume General DuBose is not lying, and that, for whatever reason, Newton didnot have sufficient opportunity to examine all the debris that closely. On thisreading, one must look at Newton’s statements that Marcel was trying to persuadehim that he was holding extraterrestrial debris, and to convince him that the“notations on the sticks were alien writings.” On this view, Marcel is stilloperating under the assumption that the original “cover story” he had heard fromthe staff meeting with Colonel Blanchard that morning, July 8, 1947, in Roswell,and under the assumption that the story Blanchard ordered Lieutenant Haut torelease to the public — that a flying saucer had been recovered — was still thepolicy. On this reading, Marcel is not trying to convince Warrant Officer Newtonabout the nature of the debris, but of what the Army Air Force wants him tothink about it. In this reading, the “bait and switch” is not of the material,but of the story the Air Force wants its own personnel to believe, and no onebothered to inform Marcel ahead of time that the “official story” had beenchanged. Admittedly, this latter analysis has many more problems than the firstone, for it makes many more assumptions.I therefore tend to accept the first reading, and that Warrant Officer Newton’somission of any mention of odd properties of the debris — properties that Korffhimself, as was seen, acknowledges — is at variance with the original debris,that therefore General DuBose’s recollection here must be discounted, and thatMarcel’s “Bait and switch” scenario stands.Korff, however, has one last witness to adduce, and that is counterintelligenceagent Sheridan Cavitt, who accompanied Major Marcel and rancher Mac Brazel tothe original debris field on the Foster ranch. In a sworn statement dated May24, 1994, for the U.S. Air Force’s official study of the Roswell Incident — thesame one that first proposed the Mogul balloon project at the explanation forthe incident — Cavitt made a number of statements that contradicted hisintelligence colleague, Major Marcel, quite directly:> 1) The area of the debris field was quite small, being about 20 feet square,> with no gouge, crater or “other obvious sign of impact;”> 2) That there “certainly wasn’t a lot of material, or enough to make up crates> of it for multiple flights;” and,> 3) That neither he nor Marcel conducted any preliminary on-site testing of the> material, neither hitting it with sledgehammers nor testing it for> radioactivity with a Geiger counter.79 Cavitt concludes by stating “My bottom line is that this whole incident was nobig deal and it certainly did not involve anything extraterrestrial.”80C. THE MOGUL BALLOON AND THE ROSWELL DEBRIS These three considerations — among some others — are employed by Korff to arguehis case that what was found at Roswell was the wreckage of a crashed top secretMogul balloon. The Mogul project was indeed “so secret and sensitive in factthat it had a national security rating of ‘Top Secret A-1,’ equal to theoriginal Manhattan Project…”81 There was nothing significant about thetechnology of the Mogul project; what was so secret was that these balloons werebeing employed to spy on the Soviet Union. By employing “constant level balloontrains” the U.S. military hoped, via the use of special low frequencymicrophones, to determine when the Soviet Union had detonated its first atombomb. These “constant level balloon trains” were “clusters of balloons that(were) balanced by size, shape, and the gasses they (were) filled with,” whichallowed the balloons to float “at a fairly consistent altitude and notcontinually rise up into the atmosphere.”82 As such, the entire assembly ofthese balloons was very long, reaching approximately 660 feet in length.83Professor Charles B. Moore was the individual “who launched most of the Moguldevices,”84 and was the engineer for the Mogul balloon project. Korff statesthat Moore’s descriptions of the Mogul balloons lists characteristics “whichcertainly explain and match the descriptions of the ‘flying saucer’ debris astestified to by the Roswell witnesses.”85 In a sworn affidavit Professor Mooredescribed the balloons’ materials in detail:> The neoprene balloons were susceptible to degradation in sunlight turning from> a translucent milky white to a dark brown. Some of the material would almost> look like dark gray or black flakes or ashes after exposure to the sun for> only a few days. The balloon material and radar target material would be> scattered after returning to the earth depending on surface winds. The balloon> material also had a peculiar acrid odor due to plasticizers and anti-oxidants.> There is a recollection from another procurement person…that he had obtained> radar reflectors from a toy manufacturer. I have a specific recollection of> reinforcing tape applied to the seams of the reflectors that had some symbols> such as arcs, flowers, circles, and diamonds. These were pinkish in color.> …> Concerning the make up [sic] of the balloon trains, we used braided or twisted> nylon lines — there were no monofilament lines…during the 1947 time frame.> Some of the balloons in early June carried radar targets for tracking purposes> since we did not have radiosonde receivers (which could pick up information> transmitted via radio waves) with us.

And as has also been seen, Korff allows the eightcharacteristics of the debris cited above to stand, including those statementsconcerning the “memory metal” characteristics of some of the debris, the extremetoughness of the foil-like material and its imperviousness to tearing, cutting,and burning. None of these characteristics are mentioned by Professor Moore, soit can hardly be concluded that any Mogul debris “certainly explain and matchthe descriptions of the ‘flying saucer’ debris as testified to by the Roswellwitnesses.” Finally, since the Mogul balloons themselves were fairly largedevices, composed of a long train of balloons and equipment, counterintelligenceagent’s Cavitt’s description of a debris field only twenty feet square simplydoes not seem large enough to accommodate such a device, unless it came crashingdown in a nice neat pile.In short, on the point of the characteristics of the debris alone, whichcharacteristics Korff himself enumerated, the Mogul explanation utterly fails,since it fails to rationalize enough of the debris characteristics as describedby the Roswell witnesses to be a plausible and credible explanation.All this knocks Korff’s attempt to discredit Kevin Randle’s response to theMogul balloon theory into a cocked hat. Collecting winds aloft data from thenational Climatic Data center in Asheville, North Carolina, Randle demonstratedthat the winds at 20,000 feet during the period of various proposed Mogullaunches were unlikely to have allowed one of the balloons to crash on theFoster ranch.88 However, Korff notes that Professor Moore used the same weatherservice data and the performance characteristics of the balloons themselves tosimulate “likely trajectories of the Mogul flights he launched with recordedground trackings” and “his results showed conclusively that Randle is wrong, andthat a Mogul balloon could have easily fallen on the Foster ranch.”89 But Randleneed not have bothered to go to those lengths, for had he paid attention to thedetails and inconsistency both of Korff’s argument and of Professor Moore’s withthe original debris descriptions, he could have easily refuted the Mogul theory.Likewise, Professor Moore’s simulation is irrelevant, for as already noted, hisdescriptions of Mogul materials and the Roswell debris descriptions do notmatch.D. BERLINER’S AND FRIEDMAN’S REFUSAL TO HEAR PROFESSOR MOORE’S SIDE OF THE STORY Korff relates one final intriguing bit of information, however, in hisrecounting of the Mogul balloon saga, and it is worth noting here:> When I asked if UFO researcher Stanton Friedman had ever contacted or> interviewed Professor Moore about Roswell, Moore told me that in the early> 1990s Friedman had placed a newspaper ad in the local paper soliciting> witnesses to Roswell. Moore then told me that he wrote to Friedman, and later> met him and Don Berliner at a hotel in Socorro. > When I inquired as to how their discussion went, Moore told me bluntly that> Friedman and Berliner did not want to hear his side of the story and then> accused him and his group as being part of the “flying saucer cover-up”!> It is curious that nowhere in Friedman and Berliner’s Crash at Corona is this> meeting ever mentioned, nor has Friedman ever noted it in his published> writings…90 As Korff demonstrated previously, this is not the first time significant detailswent unmentioned by Berliner and Friedman.Nonetheless, the fact remains that there are serious discrepancies betweenProfessor Moore’s description of the Mogul materials and that of the witnessesof the Roswell debris. And that means that, so far as Korff’s case for the Mogultheory goes, that what crashed at Roswell was not a Mogul balloon.B. KARL PFLOCK The late Karl T. Pflock authored what is perhaps the most magisterial and lucidsurvey of the skeptics’ interpretation of the Roswell Incident, Roswell:Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe.91 As with our surveys of theresearch of the pro-ET research community, our survey here will of necessityhave to leave many things out in order to show the main points of Pflock’sanalysis of the Incident. Like all Roswell Incident researchers, Pflock contendswith three main points throughout his book:> 1) The fact that most testimony concerning the bodies comes from secondhand> and in some cases impeached witnesses;> 2) The fact that most of the debris described is unusual, but not in and of> itself compelling to the conclusion that it was of extraterrestrial origin;> and,> 3) The fact that the bodies are described in ambiguous terms, which could lead> one to the conclusion that they may have been extraterrestrial, or of a> terrestrial but anomalous nature. In surveying Pflock’s analysis of the Incident, then, our focus will be on thesethree crucial areas.1. AND THE STANDARD SCENARIOA. THE DEBRIS As is by now evident, the highly unusual debris of the Incident owes its crucialrole in the story of the Roswell Incident to the researchers expounding whatPflock calls the “conventional wisdom,” and what we have been calling the“standard scenario.” Those researchers — Berlitz, Moore, Friedman, and Berliner— in turn owed the accounts of the unusual nature of this debris to the 509thBomb Group’s intelligence officer, Major Jesse Marcel Sr., to rancher MacBrazel, who first informed local civilian and later military authorities of it,and to the statements of Brazel’s children Bill Brazel and Bessie BrazelSchreiber, who claim to have seen it and handled it. Other second hand testimonyfrom Brazel’s neighbors, Floyd and Loretta Proctor, corroborated certain detailsof the descriptions of the debris, though whether or not they are describing itbecause they actually saw it, or whether Mac Brazel simply told them about it,remains a point in contention.Following the emergence of the timeline of events closely, Pflock notes thatwhile the debris was always known to be highly unusual, it was not at its firstemergence in the story considered to be extraterrestrial:> According to contemporary news reports of a July 8 interview with Mack [sic]> Brazel and the much later accounts of Bill Brazel, Bill’s younger sister> Bessie Schreiber, Mack’s sister Lorraine Ferguson and some of the Foster Ranch> area neighbors, the debris was peculiar but not something they considered at> the time of the crash to be out of this world. It included a grayish-silver> metallic foil, in pieces ranging from a few inches to two, three, or more feet> across; many small, lightweight “beams” the color and texture of balsa wood,> one-half to three-eighths of an inch thick and ranging from a few inches to a> couple of feet in length; a quantity of tough, parchmentlike [sic] paper;> pieces of hard, black or blackish-brown plastic; and lengths of something> resembling monofilament fishing line. Some of the beams were attached to> fragments of the foil-like material with wide, “whitish” or clear tape> imprinted with pastel designs resembling flowers or, as Lorraine Ferguson said> her brother Mack put it, “like the kind of stuff you find all over Japanese or> Chinese firecrackers; not really writing, just wiggles and such.”92 Note that Pflock leaves out of this list of witnesses’ descriptions thestatements Major Marcel, and that he also leaves out of the descriptions of thedebris the fact that Bill Brazel clearly stated that it could not be cut, orburnt, and that it had “memory metal” characteristics.When Brazel told (or brought pieces of the debris to) the Proctors, theysuggested, as has been seen, that “Brazel report his find to officials inRoswell. They thought it might be something belonging to or of interest to thegovernment, and he might get a reward if he took it in.”93 As is by now known,Brazel drove into Roswell on Sunday, July 6, 1947, to report the strange debristo the Chaves county sheriff, George Wilcox, who in turn suggested Brazeltelephone the air base and inform the military. As Pflock notes, Brazeldescribed the debris to his daughter Bessie as “just a bunch of garbage.”94Of course, if the debris is “just a bunch of garbage” and if his neighborsoriginally thought it belonged to or might be of interest to the government,then this clearly points to a terrestrial origin of the debris, notwithstandingthe fact, as Bill Brazel also explicitly stated when interviewed, that it hadsome very strange if not downright extraordinary properties.Then, according to the standard scenario, the military became involved, with thebase intelligence officer, Major Jesse Marcel, taking the box of debris fromBrazel, and showing it to the base commander, Colonel William Blanchard.Blanchard then ordered Marcel and the base counter-intelligence officer SheridanCavitt to accompany Brazel back to his ranch, where they could examine thedebris field itself. The July 8 morning staff meeting was held, after which Lt.Walter Haut was ordered by Colonel Blanchard to release the now famous — ordepending on one’s lights, infamous — press release about the U.S. Army AirForce having recovered a flying saucer.But the question that now occurs, given Pflock’s presentation of the debris —which is as has been seen, decidedly one-sided and omissive of its more peculiardetails - is why would the U.S. Army Air Force draw such extraordinary attentionto such ordinary material, only to deny it mere hours later? Neither ColonelBlanchard, nor Major Marcel, were fools, unless one is willing to believe thatthe Air Force in 1947 entrusted atom bombs to fools. Pflock’s eventual answeris, of course, that many of the details of the debris do correspond to thematerials used in the construction of the top secret Mogul balloons. But thequestion that now occurs is this: If the debris was from a crashed top secretballoon project, why draw the world’s attention to it with a crazy story aboutflying saucers? Why not simply issue the story that a local rancher hadrecovered a weather balloon on his ranch right then and there?To put this question differently we state it as boldly as possible in order toexpose the hidden assumptions about the press release that are made both by thepro-ET research community on the one hand, and the hidden assumptions made aboutit by the skeptical community on the other: What was the purpose behind the U.S.Army Air Force’s original “recovered flying saucer” press release, issued fromthe 509th base, in Roswell, New Mexico?For the proponents of the “crashed extraterrestrial craft” interpretation, theoriginal release had no ulterior purpose; it was merely an inadvertent admissionof the truth, which was later covered up by the military.At the other end of this pole are the skeptics such as Korff and Pflock, forwhom the original release was already a cover story to disguise the fact thatthe military, via Brazel, had recovered a top secret crashed Mogul balloon. Somewithin the skeptical community insinuate, as does Pflock, that the originalpress release was dictated after the morning staff meeting on the base, duringwhich the debris was the chief article of discussion.95However, if this was the case, then it stands to reason that — as therevisionist proponents of the “crashed extraterrestrial scenario” have proposed— at least some contact would have been made with higher headquarters during orimmediately after this meeting as to what to do, and say, about what had beenfound. But why say something so extraordinary and outlandish as having recovereda flying saucer?In order for any sort of disinformation to be effective, it has to have twoelements: firstly, it must contain enough of the truth to be believable, but,secondly, must contain a context for that truth that lends to, if not compels, amisinterpretation of the truth. In other words, the context much be contrived insuch a manner that the kernel of truth will invariably and inevitably bemisinterpreted.So, while this author agrees with the skeptics that the cover-up began with theinitial story stemming from Haut’s press release itself, he disagrees with themthat the Mogul balloon theory is a sufficient basis on which to account for it,for the “flying saucer context” far exceeds the nature of the kernel of truththat the Air Force is trying to get people to misinterpret, namely, the debris.Haut’s press release does make sense, however, if there was genuinely somethingabout the debris that was truly extraordinary, and which the U.S. Air Force didnot want people to look too closely into. And finally, while the Mogul balloontheory does make sense of the ordinary properties of the debris, it can only doso by ignoring its extraordinary ones. And even if the Mogul theory were true,it would not account for the fact that it was kept secret for so long.B. THE BODIES As was evident throughout both the standard and revisionist scenarios, the“bodies” became another interpretive context by which to interpret the debris,and by which to give its extraordinary properties a context which, supposedly,pointed in the direction of an extraterrestrial origin. Again, sticking closelyto an analysis of the actual timeline of the emergence of certain details withinthe Roswell Incident scenarios, Pflock correctly observes that the debrisflights to Fort Worth were “certain” and that there is little room for doubt forflights of debris from there to Wright Field.96 Pflock also notes, quitecorrectly, that the first claims for the recovery of “alien bodies” did notsurface “until three decades had passed and original Roswell investigatorsStanton T. Friedman and William L. Moore were conducting their inquiries.”97One witness contacted by Pflock in August of 2000 was Dr. George Agogino, one ofthose witnesses involved with the archaeologist’s story, and uncovered byrevisionist author Thomas Carey in the ongoing investigation of the Roswellincident. As Agogino was ill at the time, his wife agreed to talk to Pflock.According to her, the bodies “were human but old and bald.”98But as has also already been seen, within the standard scenario, the only clearstatements regarding bodies came from the Grady Barnett story, and thenow-discredited story of Gerald Anderson. While there were peculiarities tosuggest that others — Brazel and Marcel for example — might have seen bodies,there was absolutely nothing clear and unequivocal to suggest they did. Indeed,as we have also seen, the only time Mac Brazel said anything about bodies waswhen he was under military escort! This could be construed as duress, andwitness statements made under duress are, needless to say, questionable at bestand inadmissible at worst.This leaves the witnesses to bodies uncovered in the revisionist scenario.2. AND THE REVISIONIST SCENARIO:A. THE WITNESSES(1) JIM RAGSDALE Pflock, like Korff, pointed out the many inconsistencies and confabulations inRagsdale’s ever-evolving story, a story which Pflock humorously characterized as“a work in progress.”99 In an initial contact via telephone with Ragsdale,Pflock recounts how Ragsdale had told him he did not hear well on the telephone,and that he would have to talk to his wife.> When Mrs. Ragsdale came on the line, I explained I was doing historical> research concerning events in and around Roswell and involving Roswell Army> Air Field. I said I understood her husband may have witnessed something in> 1947 north of Roswell which was relevant to my research. “I don’t think he can> help you,” she replied. “He didn’t live here then.”> I asked when her husband moved to Roswell. “In nineteen fifty-nine,” She> replied. “I think you have the wrong Ragsdale.” That ended the conversation,> but not my interest in Mrs. Ragsdale’s husband, who indeed was the correct> Ragsdale and whom she would divorce about a year later.100 However, that was not the end to the problems with Jim Ragsdale.Pflock also observed that Ragsdale, like so many others, claimed to haverecovered debris that was later confiscated by authorities. Only in this case,Ragsdale claimed he was followed, had his car stolen, and his house burgled, byauthorities desperate to recover some of the telltale and precious debris. Butwhy, asks Pflock, “resort to the risky business of trailing him…and stealing hiscar…(or breaking into his house)? Why not do what was reported to have been doneonly the year before, after Bill Brazel talked too much in a Corona bar?” Whydid the Air Force not simply demand that Ragsdale, as it had with Bill Brazell,turn over the debris?101While discussing Brazel, however, Pflock reveals his own tendentiousness, and acertain kind of willingness to call into question every detail. Ragsdale, itwill be recalled, like many other witnesses, recalled — in his now discreditedstory — “seeing” the crash during a severe electrical thunderstorm with femalecompanion Trudy Truelove. Pflock checked the local weather service records andnoted that the only storm activity from July 2 to July 7 was at Alamagordo onJuly 2. “Clearly,” Pflock notes, “as the alert reader will have realized, theseweather data raise storm warnings not only for the Ragsdale-Truelove tale butalso other accounts central to both versions of the Roswell story.”102 But dothey really?In an age before the entire country was masked in weather radar overlays, itwould be very easy for localized severe storms — such as can arise in the vastemptiness of the New Mexico desert as any visitor or dweller in the region canattest — and have been completely missed by weather stations in the cities andinstallations that had them back then. Here, in this author’s opinion, Pflockwas reaching.In the end, Pflock comes to the same conclusion as Korff (and as we shalleventually see, Randle himself): Ragsdale’s ever-evolving story was ofabsolutely no value to aid in an understanding of the Roswell Incident, and mustbe discounted.103(2) FRANK KAUFMANN Like Korff, and even “standard scenario” proponent Stanton T. Friedman, Pflockrejects what he calls, in a bit of Offenbach-esque humor, “The Tales ofKaufmann.”104 As already noted in Korff’s humorous summary of Kaufmann’s role inthe revisionist scenario, Kaufmann seems to turn up, Walter Mitty-like, at everymajor juncture — and by his own “admission” — in the Roswell operetta. Hismultiple stories, plus the lack of information about how Randle and Schmitt wereeven put onto this source,105 is, for Pflock, reason enough to reject histestimony. Like Korff, Pflock has major difficulties with the fact that Randleand Schmitt originally told his various tales by giving Kaufmann variousaliases, “Joseph Osborne” and “Mr. X,” in their research.106 For Pflock, theproblem with Kaufmann was the same as the problem with Ragsdale, for he toldever more elaborate stories, even claiming eventually to have been a member of aspecial UFO recovery and study unit which he called “The Nine.”107And, in elaborating his “second version” of his “work in progress,” Kaufmanninformed Pflock, without any prompting from Pflock, “that the standardalien-Gray description — big black eyes set in a disproportionately large headperched upon a short, spindly body — ‘is all wrong. See, these people were justlike us. Well, just like us only better.’” When Pflock asked him what thismeant, Kaufmann responded “More perfectly formed.”108Not to be outdone by other proponents of the “crash, retrieval, and reverseengineering scenario,” Kaufmann also maintained that he was also involved in aspecial group recovering the alien technology and seeding it into Americanindustry, and that the whole concept of the radar stealthy bomber “came fromthis,” the crashed and recovered craft.109But as Pflock notes, in addition to these rather obvious “Walter Mitty”credibility problems, Kaufmann himself was discharged from the military in 1945,two years before the Roswell Incident even happened, and was employed “as acivilian at the Roswell base in the singularly routine job of personnel clerk,the same job he did in uniform,”110 making it highly unlikely that Kaufmannwould have been selected for any one of the secretive tasks he maintained he wasinvolved in, much less all of them.B. THE RADAR TRACKING STORY It was Kaufmann, in his alias as “Joseph Osborne,” who of course had told Randleand Schmitt the story about him being ordered to a special radar unit to trackthe UFOs flying over New Mexico in 1947, and it was Kaufmann who told them hehad watched as it had ballooned up on the radar screen, and then apparentlycrashed. Finally, it was Kaufmann who maintained that there had been threedifferent radar sites involved in the alleged operation, giving the military arough approximation of where the object had crashed based on triangulation.But it was the same Kaufmann who, as noted by Pflock, later maintained that thecraft was radar “stealthy” and which was responsible for the stealth bomber! So,as Pflock rightly notes, “if the alien vehicle Kaufman says was recovered at theimpact site had ‘stealthy’ properties, how would it have been possible for theradars at White Sands, Roswell, and Kirtland to detect it?”111But there were other big problems with Kaufmann’s radar tracking story, and wehave already noted some of them in our survey of Korff’s research. Pflock dugdeeper:> First, what Kaufmann claims appeared on the radars when the craft was struck> by lightning is strictly in the science-fiction special effects category. One> expert with whom I spoke characterized it as “very creative.” If a target> being tracked by a radar of the types then in use by the army in New Mexico,> members of the long-wave (ten centimeters plus) SCR-70 and -584 families, were> hit by lightning, the results on the radarscope, if any at all, would be no> more than a slight, momentary brightening of the target blip or a tiny segment> of the cursor line that sweeps around the circular scope at the same rate the> radar’s antenna rotates. … Moreover, something would be seen only if the> lightning struck precisely at the same instant the radar beam swept across the> target….> Second, mountains ranging in elevation from seven thousand to twelve thousand> feet lie between White Sands and the debris field and the alleged impact site.> The elevation of the White Sands area is between four thousand and forty-five> hundred feet. A similar mountain barrier exists between the sites and Kirtland> Air Force Base… which lies at about fifty-three hundred feet. Anything flying> at an altitude putting it behind the mountains as seen from these locations> would be invisible to their radars. Anything flying only slightly higher than> the mountains would be lost to the Lloyd’s Mirror effect, in which the radar> signal return from the aerial target and that from the ground (mountains)> cancel each other out.112 This means only the Roswell radar would have been in> a position to track the craft, and even if only on a limited basis, as> Roswell’s elevation is about thirty-six hundred feet, while the alleged impact> site and the debris field like at approximately forty-one hundred and> fifty-eight hundred feet, respectively.> As for Kaufmann’s claim that triangulated radar plots were used to determine> where the craft crashed, it merely exposes his woeful ignorance of radar. Data> from more than one radar is not required to determine the direction and> distance of a target that has gone down.113 The crash location can be> calculated quickly from the last azimuth (directional) reading and slant range> (straight-line distance from the radar antenna to the object in flight) from a> single radar. The name radar, after all, is a contraction of the phrase “radio> detedection and ranging.”> Third, there is Kaufmann’s claim the damaged but intact craft was transported> out of Roswell by air without being dismantled. According to Kaufmann, the> alien vehicle spanned fifteen feet and was twenty-two to twenty-five feet long> and five feet think. In July 1947 and for years after, there was no aircraft> in the world, let alone the American military inventory, capable of> accommodating a [sic] object of those dimensions.114 In short, there is nothing whatsoever credible in Frank Kaufman’s stories,neither in their totality nor their details. And this means, once again, thatanother witness who saw “bodies” is discredited.C. “THE TERROR AND OTHER EXAGGERATIONS” Another area both of the standard and of the revisionist scenarios that Pflockinvestigated was the assertion of many witnesses that they were threatened intosilence by the military. Indeed, as Pflock himself observes, at one time he tookthese threats and intimidations as an indicator that something more than just acrashed Mogul balloon had to have been involved in the Roswell Incident.115Pflock, however, began to question his own reasoning, because with theappearance of the second official explanation — the downed weather balloon story— “taking the sort of heavy-handed actions testified to by some could havebackfired, reigniting press interest and exposing the project to hostile foreignpowers,”116 namely, the Soviet Union.However, there is another problem according to Pflock, and that is that therewere only five such witnesses, namely, “Glenn Dennis, Frankie Rowe, Ruben Anaya,Jim Ragsdale, and Barbara Dugger, granddaughter of Chaves County Sheriff GeorgeWilcox and his wife, Inez.”117 As Pflock notes, and as we have already seen, thefirst four witnesses — including Frankie Rowe and her assertions that her fatherresponded to a fire department call out of town — have significant credibilityproblems. Dennis and Ragsdale stand as impeached or incredible witnesses, andFrankie Rowe’s story suffers from the problem that the military would not likelyhave allowed a civilian agency on the site as it had its own equipment, and evenif it did, would most likely simply have sworn any civilian witnesses tosecrecy, sans any threats. As for Dugger, as Pflock notes, her story of threatsemerged as an “unsupported secondhand account” only weeks after the Roswellstory ran on the now famous television episode of Unsolved Mysteries.118D. KEVIN RANDLE’S BREAK WITH DON SCHMITT As the revisionist scenario and its witnesses came increasingly unglued, anotherepisode surfaced to cast a pall of suspicion over the whole affair, and that wasKevin Randle’s co-author, Don Schmitt, who had been caught by UFO researchers ina number of contradictions about his personal life as well as his conduct ofinvestigations. While this is not the appropriate place to summarize thisepisode,119 they did lead to a break between Randle and Schmitt. Randle, in aletter to Pflock and other UFO researchers in which he severed all professionaland personal connections with Schmitt, and warned them about his one-timecoauthor’s credibility.1203. A PERSONAL NOTE ON MAJOR JESSE MARCEL SR. In their quest to dismiss any extraordinary aspects to the Roswell story —whether terrestrial or extraterrestrial — the Roswell skeptics have concentratedon certain aspects of Major Jesse Marcel’s character, claiming tendencies toexaggeration, as noted in some of his army records, to his apparently “false”claims of his piloting ability or claims to having shot down enemy aircraft incombat, and so on.Personally, I find such attacks to be both pettifogging in a certain sense, andreprehensible in another, and completely neglecting the fact that, for whateverMajor Marcel’s alleged “shortcomings,” the overall, and major fact remains,namely, that he was the senior intelligence officer of the world’s only atomicbomb group in the world at that time, and that he would hardly have beenentrusted with that position unless the Army Air Force reposed some confidencein his abilities. All else, it seems to me, is mere tendentiousness, designed toget rid of one incontrovertible fact about the Roswell Incident: theextraordinary properties of the debris, and the extraordinary lengths to whichthe military went to cover it up, from its initial flying saucer story, to itsweather balloon story, and now, its Mogul balloon story.I will not, therefore, engage in attacks on Major Marcel, nor repeat here thearguments and attacks of others, nor call into question either his integrity asa man or as a witness, for the fact remains that someone in his position wouldhardly be prone to mistake a balloon — weather balloon or otherwise — for theexotic properties he consistently described throughout his life. In any case,Marcel is not the only witness describing them. So this brings us to the debrisagain, and to Pflock’s handling of it.4. THE DEBRIS AGAIN As was seen in our recounting of Kaufmann’s and Radsdale’s descriptions of thebodies — testimony from witnesses now no longer accepted — nothing in thedetails even of their descriptions compelled to the conclusion that they wereextraterrestrials.121However, Pflock observes that “when all is said and done” that those first- orsecondhand witnesses that “can unequivocally be considered genuine” are “just41. Of these, 23 are known, claim, or can reasonably be thought to have seenphysical evidence, debris recovered from the Foster Ranch. Of this group, only 7have asserted that what they saw had unusual properties of exhibited somethingelse suggestive of otherworldly origins.”122This debris, with its unusual “hieroglyphics” and “tape,” its foil-like andbalsa-wood-like materials, is what would be pointed to time and again by Mogulballoon proponents — Pflock included — as the “final solution” to the RoswellIncident mystery.Pflock, however, was a bit more honest, and much less disingenuous, than the airforce.Noting that Marcel had given an interview in 1981, Pflock observes that Marcelmentioned a “`porous material (that) you could blow through’ which he and(counter-intelligence officer Sheridan) Cavitt found on the site.”123 This doesnot sound too much like the material of a balloon, nor like the foil on itsradar reflectors!Additionally, Pflock notes that fellow skeptic Kal Korff maintained that he hada close “confidential ufological working relationship with the late LeonardStringfield, an important figure in crashed-saucer research and lore.”124According to Korff, Marcel gave an interview in April 1978 with Stringfield and“Chicago radio personality Steve Tom,” only two months after Marcel had firstspoken with researcher Stanton T. Friedman. Korff maintains that during thatinterview “Marcel had indicated he never even considered the ‘alien’ part ofthings as a possible explanation until UFO ‘researchers’ started SUGGESTING thatidea to him.”125If true, then this would indeed knock the whole extraterrestrial interpretationof the Roswell Incident into a cocked hat. But as we shall also see in PartThree, it is not necessary to assume this; one can indeed assume that Marcelsaid, from the outset, that it was his belief that it was extraterrestrial, onecan explain it along extraordinary though terrestrial lines, and do so withoutcalling into question Marcel’s memory, his integrity, or the reasons for his“extraterrestrial” conclusions.In any case, Pflock himself admits, even while advocating the Mogul hypothesis,that in the final analysis to do so “Admittedly…requires discounting some ofwhat the witnesses say they recall about certain properties of the debris,something I was loath to do a few years ago…. Now, however, armed with muchadditional countervailing information and my will to believe in check, I amcertain it is entirely reasonable to disregard testimony about anomalousproperties.”126But this, as Pflock admits, can really only be done by discounting what thesewitnesses describe, and doing so by calling into question their integrity, theirmemories, their motivations, and so on. It can only be done by entertaining a“will to disbelieve,” and a corresponding will to believe a military that,within one day, first said it had a flying saucer, then said it was all amistake and that it was just a weather balloon, and asked us to believe that thesenior intelligence officer of the only atom bomb group in the entire world atthe time, was unable to tell the difference, and to believe a military that nowsays it was yet another kind of balloon.Skeptics may, if they wish, accuse the advocates of the extraterrestrialhypothesis of the Roswell Incident of a “will to believe” and of a gallopingcredulousness. But frankly, this author finds the same fault with their ownspeculations and reconstructions.Indeed, as we shall now see, Kevin Randle was not about to take the skeptics’arguments, and the “Hot Air Force’s” Mogul balloon explanation, lying down.image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Kal K.

Kaufmann’s story,if credible, would mean that it had to have been flying above these altitudes ina range where it would have been visible to the radars. This, of course, doesnot do away with the first problem, namely, that Kaufmann’s description ofhaving witnessed the “explosion” of the craft on radar is pure fabrication, forthe sets in use them could not have seen such a thing.113 Pflock’s point here is rather obvious, since “radar” stands for “radiodetection and ranging,” and had Kaufmann’s nonsensical story any physical basisin fact, it would have been necessary for warships during the war to carry morethan one radar set in order to determine the bearing and distance of a target inorder to direct their guns by radar range-finding.

It was to be the AirForce’s second, final, and as we shall see momentarily, ultimately failedattempt to convince the public that what crashed in Roswell was merely aballoon, although this time around, the Air Force did not make the mistake oftrying to sell a mere weather balloon to the public. This time the explanationhad to be more exotic, as whatever else may have emerged from the variousRoswell researchers, one thing seemed incontrovertible: “something” of an exoticnature had to have crashed, because the Air Force went to such extraordinarylengths to cover it up. Whatever the Air Force’s latest explanation turned outto be, it had to be more exotic than a mere weather balloon in order to accountfor all the initial hullaballoo.This thankless task fell to Captain James McAndrew, and his The Roswell Report:Case Closed, the last word of the U.S. Air Force on the Roswell matter, waspublished by the U.S. Government Printing Office in June of 1997, under thesignature of the Clinton Administration’s Secretary of the Air Force, Sheila W.Widnall.2 While this book is indeed full of fascinating and interestinginformation in its own right, one does not have to read very far in order towonder whether any of it has any relevance to the Roswell Incident, for as willbe seen, the report suffers from a fatal flaw, a flaw that was not immediatelyevident when the 3 report was first published.3 Moreover, this flaw, as willalso be seen, raises certain questions about many of the Roswell “witnesses”themselves, if one dares to entertain those questions.A. THE U.S. AIR FORCE’S BALLOON EXPLANATIONS: “CASE CLOSED”? Captain McAndrew begins the final Air Force report by making two admissions, andtwo very direct claims and assertions. First, the first admission:> The July 1994 Air Force report concluded that the predecessor to the U.S. Air> Force, the U.S. Army Air Forces, did indeed recover material near Roswell in> July 1947.4 The second admission occurs a short while later:> The issue of “bodies” was not discussed extensively in the 1994 report because> there were not any bodies connected with events that occurred in 1947.5 Before proceeding, it is worth pausing to consider the implications of these tworemarks carefully, and in the light of the previous chapters’ presentations.What these two admissions amount to is that the “first articulation” of theRoswell Incident, namely, that the U.S. Army Air Forces had recovered a flyingsaucer near Roswell in July 1947 is substantially true in one important respect:there was no mention in the first articulation of recovered bodies, only arecovered technology. In a roundabout way, therefore, the U.S. Air Force isadmitting to the first version of the story: “something” crashed, and the U.S.Air Force recovered it.It is within this context that McAndrew’s report makes its two assertions. Thefirst is that what was recovered near Roswell in 1947 was nothing more than“debris from an Army Air Forces balloon-borne research project code-namedMOGUL.”6 McAndrews’s report, in other words, makes it clear that the U.S. AirForce is sticking by its Mogul balloon explanation, and in a certain sense, ithad to, because as McAndrew notes, the original 1994 report carefully argued itsMogul case with a nearly exhaustive 1,000 page study of the Roswell Incident andthe Mogul project records.7 This is followed closely by a reassertion of the AirForce’s claims that the Project Mogul explanation is an adequate explanation ofthe descriptions of the Roswell debris, for Captain McAndrew explicitly claimsthat the Mogul project “components clearly accounted for the claims of ‘flyingsaucer’ debris recovered in 1947,”8 although as has been observed immediatelyabove, he acknowledges that the original Air Force report failed to account forthe second component of the Roswell data-set, the bodies.9In other words, already, on page one of the Air Force’s final official statementon the Roswell Incident, its case has already collapsed, and that for a verysimple reason. That reason is that, while the Mogul project components do indeedaccount for many of the descriptions of the Roswell debris by witnesses, they donot account for most or all of those descriptions. For example, the Mogulcomponents do account for the descriptions of the “tape” with the hieroglyphicsin purplish or pink hues, for such tape was indeed used on the Mogul balloons.Moreover, the descriptions of parchment like material and of foil can also beaccounted for by the Mogul project’s use of neoprene balloons and various radarreflector targets made of foil. Finally, the Mogul components also account forthe descriptions of balsa-wood like components described by Marjor Marcel, hisson Jesse Marcel Jr., and by Bill Brazel and his sister, Bessie BrazelSchreiber.However, there all resemblance between the Mogul components and the descriptionsof these witnesses – most of them primary first hand witnesses who all claim tohave seen and handled the material – ends, for those witnesses clearly describedfoil-like material of great tensile strength, of “balsa” wood-like material thatcould neither be cut nor burned, and of a “memory” metal that, when wadded up,would unfold and return to its original state, without any evidence of creases.And finally, Major Marcel also described some of this material as “porous,” suchthat one could blow through it. Throughout McAndrew’s report, one looks in vainfor a credible explanation of these properties. Such explanations are utterlylacking, and a simple glance at the list of “witnesses” that Captain McAndrewadduces will show why this is so.1. THE AIR FORCE CALLS THE ROSWELL WITNESSES On pages 69 through 74 of The Roswell Report: Case Closed, Captain McAndrewproduces a table entitled “Comparison of Testimony to Actual Air ForceEquipment, Vehicles, and Procedures Used to Launch and Recover AnthropomorphicDummies.”10 This is an indicator of the case that the report tries to establish,namely, that while the Mogul Project is used by the Air Force to account –unsuccessfully – for the Roswell debris, something else was needed to accountfor the bodies. Enter the various high-altitude balloon experiments withanthropomorphic dummies. More of this “explanation” in a moment. For the presentmoment, our concentration must remain on this table, and its massive, andmassively fatal, implications.If one studies this table carefully, five categories of witness descriptions –of aliens, of the alleged crashed craft, of vehicles the witnesses observed theArmy Air Force using in the recovery, of aircraft, and of the recoveryprocedures themselves – are arranged in columnar fashion, with the specificwitness and his or her description on the left, and the alleged correspondingAir Force equipment or procedure in the middle column, and on the right, acolumn indicating where the “crash site” was supposed to be where the equipment,aliens, or procedure were allegedly observed.It is when one examines who these witnesses are that one encounters the massiveproblem, for absolutely nowhere do the names of Major Jesse Marcel – the AirForce’s own on-site intelligence officer at that time – or Mac Brazel’s son,Bill Brazel, or his sister, Bessie Brazel Schreiber, appear! In other words, theAir Force is even more blatant in its tendentiousness than some of theproponents of the extraterrestrial interpretation of the Roswell Incidentexamined in previous chapters!But that’s not all, nor does this constitute the massive, fatal problem.2. ITS POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE: THE MASSIVE, FATAL PROBLEM A glance at who the witnesses are, reveals that fatal problem. Not only are theprimary debris witnesses completely missing, but the witnesses Captain McAndrewcites are none other than Jim Ragsdale (eleven times), Gerald Anderson of theforged diary claim (thirty-three times!), Frank Kaufmann of the “Tales ofKaufmann” fame (once), Knight (once), and the Maltaises, who first informedStanton Friedman of the Grady Barnett and recovered bodies story (seven times).In short, not only is the handling of the witnesses utterly tendentious – foronly those witnesses agreeing with the Air Force’s case are cited – but thesewitnesses are those who, in turn, have been found by both the Roswell skeptics’and believers’ communities to be not-credible! In fact, the vast majority ofcitations in McAndrew’s table are from Ragsdale and Anderson (forty-fourcitations out of a total of fifty-three)!To put it bluntly and succinctly, the case for the crash of balloons and crashdummies so carefully outlined by Captain McAndrew is based almost entirely onthe testimony of witnesses that neither the Roswell believers’ nor skeptics’communities any longer accept, and that means that the main witness case thatMcAndrew adduces has collapsed.This means that the Air Force’s careful table of comparisons is utterly uselessand irrelevant to the interpretation of the Roswell Incident. The table ofcomparison fails utterly to account for the clear statements of Major Marcel andBill Brazel as to the unique and extraordinary properties of the debris, andthat means, that Mogul is not the solution to the Roswell Incident.This conclusion now casts a unique light on Captain McAndrew’s initialadmissions, and on the statements of the witnesses cited in this table, for onthe one hand, by admitting that it did indeed perform recovery efforts inRoswell in July of 1947, and by the fact that the Mogul components do notexplain the debris, the strong possibility arises that the Air Force did indeedrecover something, and that a Mogul balloon was not what it recovered, but is infact part of an ongoing cover-up. And on the other hand, because the witnessesadduced in the table do in fact describe specifics that are so self-evidentlysimilar to Air Force equipment and procedures, even though the majority of thecitations come from witnesses no longer acknowledged by either the sleptics’ orbelievers’ communities are being credible, the possibility also arises and bearsmentioning that those witnesses themselves may have been planted, anddeliberately seeding disinformation into the Roswell research community.This possibility now casts the refusal of researchers Stanton T. Friedman andDon Berliner to hear the case of Mogul project participant Professor Moore intoa new light. McAndrew states that episode in the following fashion:> In response to the newspaper announcement (by Friedman soliciting witnesses to> come forward and share information about the Roswell incident), two scientists> central to the actual explanation of the “Roswell” events. Professor Charles> B. Moore, a former U.S. Army Air Forces contract engineer, and Bernard D.> Gildenberg, retired Holloman (Air Force Base) Branch Physical Science> Administrator and Meteorologist, came forward with pertinent information.> According to Moore and Gildenberg, when they met with the authors their> explanations that some of the Air Force projects they participated in were> mostly likely responsible for the incident, they were summarily dismissed. The> authors even went so far as to suggest that these distinguished scientists> were participants in a multifaceted government cover-up to conceal the truth> about the Roswell Incident.11 But rather than read this incident with Friedman and Berliner as the culprits,why not the reverse? Why not read it with Moore and Gildenberg as the culprits,for as is evident from the later context of the Air Force’s “final report,” itis evident that the Air Force will go to almost any length to implant the ideaof the balloon interpretation of the Incident, including the exclusion ofMarcel’s and Brazel’s debris testimony to the citation of witnesses not viewedas credible by either the skeptical or believers’ community! Thus, Friedman andBerliner, who clearly already knew of the unusual property of the debris asdescribed by Marcel and others, were rightfully concerned about being approachedby former Air Force personnel who could do nothing but “spin” those propertiesaway.In short, Berliner and Friedman appear to have been exercising due caution,rather than the ham-fisted tendentiousness as insinuated by Korff in theprevious chapter, or as insinuated by the Air Force report. If there is anyham-fisted tendentiousness, it is in this table of correspondences between“witness” descriptions and Air Force equipment and procedures.The bottom line is that the Air Force explanation simply fails to explain theunusual properties of the debris, and the possibility must be entertained, forall the above reasons, that the Mogul explanation is the latest, and cleverest,attempt to perpetuate a cover-up of what happened in Roswell in 1947. And in thefinal analysis, it is not really that clever.3. THE BALLOON LAUNCH HYPOTHESIS: BODIES AND DEBRIS These considerations cast the rest of the report into an unusual light as well.Perhaps sensing that its clumsy attempt to explain the Roswell debris by theMogul balloon explanation alone was ultimately a futile exercise, the Air Forcenow maintained that the descriptions of “witnesses” got the basic facts right,but the times wrong, and that they were describing secret high altitude balloonlaunches of anthropomorphic dummies – which would “explain” the bodies — and ofspace probes, which loosely would account for the debris properties that wereclearly not attributable to any balloon. In testimony of this explanation, theAir Force report reproduced several photos of balloons actually launchingunusual cargos consisting of space probes:image [images/00021.jpg] Launch of a High Altitude Balloon and Payload from Holloman Air Force Base,197612 image [images/00022.jpg] Another High Altitude Payload Launch with an Air Force Balloon13 Intriguing and suggestive as these pictures are, they fail to account for twosimple facts: firstly, all of the pictures depicted in the Air Force report arefrom periods subsequent to the Roswell Incident, and it can only argue that thenon-credible “witnesses” it adduces were confused as to what time the event tookplace. Secondly, even if one were to grant that a similar project was under wayat the time of the Incident, none of the exotic probes being launched by theseballoons would seem to possess the unusual properties attested to by Marcel,Bill Brazel, and others, namely, great tensile strength, the inability to be cutor burnt, or the “memory metal” characteristics.And there is a final problem, and the careful reader will have noticed itimmediately, and that is that these pictures of balloons launching unusual and“exotic” equipment are an explanation that can “account” for the first twoexplanations offered by the Air Force on July 8, 1947, namely, its initialreport that it had recovered a flying saucer, and its subsequent report, merehours later, that it was just a weather balloon.Succinctly stated, the Air Force’s 1997 report tends inadvertently to supportour previously-stated consideration that the initial press release by FirstLieutenant Walter Haut was itself a part of the cover-up, and not an inadvertentadmission of the truth. If that be the case, however, it seems suspicious thatthose two cover stories of 1947 — the crashed saucer and the weather balloon —would have been prepared so long in advance of these most recent revelations.If, as has been suggested, the current Air Force theory still does not accountfor all the properties of the debris — and it clearly does not — then thissuggests that a very elaborate and long range disinformation campaign was putinto place at the outset, and that the current revelations are part of thatcampaign. If this be the case, then the Roswell Incident likely still containsan exotic, extraordinary core. Moreover, as the above pictures suggest, thetruth of the Roswell Incident may lie somewhere between the skeptical end of thespectrum, with its “mere balloon” explanation, and the believers’ end of thespectrum, with its “crashed extraterrestrial craft” interpretation.In any case, the problem remains what is was from the very moment Major Marceldescribed the debris to Stanton Friedman: the initial problem was the debris,not the bodies. The bodies, as the Air Force report itself observes, entered theRoswell story at a subsequent point.4. THE HIEROGLYPHICS: A FAILURE TO EXPLAIN The debris’s unusual properties are not the only material problems that the AirForce report encounters. The other one is the repeated assertions by MajorMarcel, his son Jesse Marcel Jr, Mac Brazel’s son Bill Brazel, and his daughterBessie Brazel Schreiber, to have seen strange Chinese- or Japanese-like writingor even “hieroglyphics” on some of the Roswell material. The Air Force’s RoswellReport: Case Closed, may contain what is the most egregiously inane explanationof them all. Indeed, in a certain sense, it actually boggles the mind that aftersuch an initial careful report as its Mogul explanation of 1994, that the AirForce would release a final report that, once again, relied on a “witness” withwhom the Roswell research community was increasingly having credibilitydifficulties.That witness was the now-impeached Glenn Dennis, whose fanciful tales of anurse, alien bodies, and debris with hieroglyphics in the back of an armyambulance, were coming under increasing doubt by the Roswell research community,which at that time was pressuring Dennis to release the name of his anonymousnurse friend. As is now known, he eventually did so, but when no record of thatnurse could be found in the records, Dennis changed his tune and said that hehad deliberately given a false name of the nurse in order to protect heridentity and keep a promise he had made to her. In that step, Dennis impeachedhimself as a witness.Any testimony of Dennis to the Air Force thus stands in the same position as the“witnesses” cited in Captain McAndrew’s careful table of comparisons between“witness” statements and actual Air Force equipment and procedures at that time:it is entirely valueless as testimony.Nonetheless, it is worth examining what the 1997 Air Force report says, orrather, pictures, about Dennis, and about his “ambulance with debris, a canoe,and “hieroglyphics.” The following picture of an army ambulance, configured as aradio vehicle for the balloon projects of the period, is offered as anexplanation both of the “debris” that he saw, of the “craft” that looked like a“canoe,” and of the “hieroglyphics.”image [images/00023.jpg] Ambulance with “Hieroglyphics”14 The explanation of this equation of clear, plain Roman letters in clear, simpleEnglish, as “hieroglyphics,” is almost as comical as its early “swamp gas” and“Venus” explanations for early UFO sightings:> …the so called “hieroglyphics were a probable reference to the lettering> painted on the equipment support rack above the panels. The lettering on the> rack would be visible, but probably not readable, to an observer that quickly> walked past the ambulance. Other wreckage “all over the floor” that was “like> broken glass,” was a probable reference to the clear plastic 30-foot> polyethylene balloon that was recovered following the balloon training mission> and placed in the back of the converted ambulance or the weapons carrier for> later disposal.15 Uh-huh. I know that whenever I walk by a sign and see it in my peripheralvision, and cannot really make out what it says, that I immediately think thatmy illiteracy is probably due to that sign’s being written in hieroglyphics. AndI know that the reader probably thinks this as well.The sheer lunacy of “explanation” here is about as nutty as Arlen Specter’s“magic bullet” theory for the Warren Commission, only in this case, it is muchworse, for now we have a nutty explanation for a story that ultimately bears norelevance to the Roswell Incident whatsoever. Even if one allows Dennis’testimony for the sake of argument, he was hardly a fool, and would hardlymistake plain English for hieroglyphics, nor common radio racks for unusualdebris and a canoe-shaped craft.Whatever one makes of Glenn Dennis, he was hardly this big of a fool, andneither are we.5. SUMMING UP In summary, the Air Force’s “final report” is, at the minimum, a major failureto explain the Roswell Incident, and at the maximum, an utter failure to do so.As has been seen, its preponderant and tendentious reliance upon discreditedwitnesses only marginalizes the whole effort to compare their statements withknown equipment, procedures, and secret projects of the era into a vastirrelevancy. The report fails to explain the most unusual properties of thedebris as recounted by firsthand witnesses Jesse Marcel Sr., and Jesse MarcelJr., not to mention Bill Brazel and his sister Bessie. Indeed, those witnessesare not even mentioned in the Air Force report. This fact, plus its relianceupon witnesses discredited both by the Roswell believers’ and skeptics’community means that the report cannot be viewed as anything other thandeliberately tendentious, and a continuing cover-up, since it refuses to dealwith these anomalous descriptions.Similarly, the report’s attempt to explain the bodies is suspect simply becauseits explanations are anachronistic and obfuscate those witnesses’s testimony byinsinuating that they remember all details correctly, except the timing of theincidents. This is clearly a tendentious and a dubious methodology, for itallows the Air Force to cherry-pick which memories of a witness are “genuine”and which are “faulty,” an almost Soviet-style psychological procedure, and adangerous and dubious moral precedent for any agency of the American federalgovernment to establish.Nonetheless, the report does raise interesting questions, for its official“explanation” of high-altitude balloon-launched anthropomorphic dummies andhighly unusual space probes does suggest that the actual Roswell Incident truthlies somewhere between “mere balloons” and “extraterrestrial craft.” As was alsosuggested, its’ easy and convenient explanation also raises the possibility thatboth the original “recovered flying saucer” and “crashed weather balloon”stories were part of a cover-up. In this respect, the central properties of theRoswell Incident that remained unexplained by the Mogul theory were the exoticproperties of the Roswell debris described by primary witnesses Jesse Marcel Sr.Jesse Marcel Jr, and Bill Brazel.B. KEVIN RANDLE’S RESPONSES Some of the most subtle responses to the questions raised by the skeptics, andby the Air Force reports themselves, were given by Kevin Randle, who, now freeof the “extraterrestrial euphoria” and “saucer logic” of his former partner DonSchmitt, has returned to a more balanced tone and tempered analysis in hisrecent writings. Indeed, in this author’s opinion, if one compares the tone ofRandle’s more recent Roswell Revisited (2007) with that of his and thenco-author Don Schmitt’s UFO Crash at Roswell (1991) or The Truth About the UFOCrash at Roswell (1994), that tone is downright subdued.1. RANDLE’S ADMISSIONS REGARDING THE PRINCIPAL REVISIONIST WITNESSES The signal example of this new, “less confident” but “more analytical” tone isevident in Randle’s admissions and statements about the status of the twoprimary witnesses in the revisionist scenario, Jim Ragsdale and Frank Kaufmann:> A number of years ago I believed that I had interviewed more than a half a> dozen people who had seen the bodies of the alien creatures killed in the> Roswell UFO crash. These were men who claimed to have firsthand knowledge, had> been stationed in Roswell at the time, or who lived in Roswell at the time,> and who seemed to be telling me the truth. One by one I learned that they> hadn’t seen alien bodies and their stories, while quite exciting, were not> based in reality.> That seemed to set the investigation back to its original point, meaning we> had only the testimony of those who had seen the strange metallic debris, who> had walked the Debris Field on the Foster Ranch, or had seen something in the> air that might have been the craft just prior to the crash.16 Note carefully what Randle is saying here: without the testimony of discreditedwitnesses such as Gerald Anderson, Frank Kaufmann, Glenn Dennis, or JimRagsdale, the whole nature of the Roswell Incident reverts back to its originalfirst articulation: the recovery of a technology only. Indeed, out of theoriginal crop of witnesses testifying to bodies of some sort, the only witness’stestimony that remains is that of Sergeant Melvin Brown, and in that instance,one is reliant upon second-hand dead man’s testimony.In this respect, Randle’s very next admission is interesting in its own right,and it is worth citing again its context:> That seemed to set the investigation back to its original point, meaning we> had only the testimony of those who had seen the strange metallic debris, who> had walked the Debris Field on the Foster Ranch, or had seen something in the> air that might have been the craft just prior to the crash.> While that is enough to get us started again, it certainly doesn’t take us to> the extraterrestrial.17 In other words, Randle is admitting what we’ve been arguing all along, that thedescriptions of the debris, while exotic, are not exotic enough to compel to theconclusion that it is exotic enough to come from something extraterrestrial.18Randle is even more specific with respect to the two principal witnesses thatformed so much a part of the “revisionist scenario,” Frank Kaufmann and JimRagsdale; regarding these two now thoroughly discredited and discountedwitnesses, Randle observes that> In the years since the Roswell case exploded all over the media and dozens of> people have begun investigations, there has been quite a bit of false, faked,> and lousy information published. I confess that I have been guilty of my share> of it, such as giving Frank Kaufmann a voice much louder than he deserved, but> I’m not alone. We’ve been graced with Glenn Dennis, Gerald Anderson, Jim> Ragsdale, and dozens of other lesser lights who really knew no more about the> case than we did.19 Randle also observes that one of the principal reasons Kaufmann’s storyunraveled was that, after he died, original documents were discovered upon whichKaufmann had concocted forgeries in order to falsify his military record.20 “SoKaufmann’s story, like that of Dennis, fell apart…. No corroboration for hiswild tales meant that we could now reject his story as invention.”21He is equally as unsparing of one-time star witness Jim Ragsdale:> The discrepancies that have appeared are more than the minor changes expected> as someone tries to remember events in the distant past. Researchers expect a> story to shift with each telling simply because of the mechanisms of memory,> but these changes go beyond that. Ragsdale first reported seeing the bodies in> the distance and then, in his second, more dramatic version, claimed he tried> to pull a helmet off one. He originally provided a vague description of the> alien and then gave one that seems to match those given by people claiming to> be abducted by aliens. Ragsdale said he watched the arrival of the military> and described the convoy and later claimed to have left before the trucks were> in view. Originally he said the crash site was thirty to forty miles north of> Roswell but this later changed to sixty or seventy miles away.22 The same accusations — an ever-evolving “work in progress,” shifting details,forged and fabricated documents, could also be said to be true of one timeprimary “alien bodies” witness Gerald Anderson.23Randle does mention one crucial detail about some of these “witnesses” thatcould be highly significant in the light of our above-proposed deep-cover andlong-range disinformation scenario, and that is that it was former firstlieutenant Walter Haut, the same Haut responsible for the now famous flyingsaucer press release of 1947, who led Roswell researchers to Glenn Dennis,24 andto Frank Kaufmann!252. “NEW” WITNESSES, AND OLD ONES RETREADED With these admissions, the search was under way once again for witnesses —primary or otherwise — who could speak to the issue of the bodies, for thebodies were what they always were, the key to arguing a convincing case thatwhat crashed was extraterrestrial.Randle and others soon uncovered them, only this time, the collective picturethat they presented was not nearly as tidy as his and one-time co-author DonSchmitt’s, nor even as tidy as the “standard scenario” of Berlitz, Moore,Berliner, and Friedman. One of these was Anne Robbins, whose husband, ErnestRobert Robbins, had been a tech sergeant on the base during the Incident. Annerelated that her husband had come home wet one night from the base, stating thathe had gone through some sort of decontamination process. When asked what it wasall about, she related that he told her that “there had been a flying saucercrash outside of Roswell.” According to Anne, her husband described it as“saucer shaped and that there was a top layer that was oblong and had windows init.”26Robbins’ alleged description of the aliens was more interesting:> Robbins told his wife that there had been three beings on the craft. He used> the word people. One was dead and two were alive. Later he would tell his son> that the creatures had pear-shaped heads with large black eyes and brown skin.> In a break with traditional descriptions, he said that they had no nose and no> mouth.27 The only truly and genuinely unusual physiological features allegedly describedby Ernest Robbins to his wife are the lack of a nose and mouth.Randle also returned in Roswell Revisited to defend the statements of FrankieRowe, who maintained that her father, a fireman with the Roswell Fire Departmentin 1947, had responded to a call north of Roswell, where he saw both debris andaliens. In response to the criticism of skeptics that the fire department, withonly two trucks at that time, would hardly have responded to calls from outsidethe city, Randle consulted the logs for a period going “back into the 1920s.”Contrary to the arguments of the skeptics, he did indeed find records thatshowed responses to alarms outside the city.28 Randle admits, however, thatthere are no records for a response to a call during the period of the RoswellIncident.29 Randle hints that “For those with a conspiratorial turn of the mind,the claim might be that the Army managed to get the entry of that specific runremoved so that there would be no documentation if anyone ever looked.”30 In anycase, Rowe described he father as seeing three bodies, two dead and one alive.They were small, about the size of a ten-year old, and with copper-coloredskin.31 Unfortunately for the extraterrestrial scenario, there is nothing inthese physiological details to compel to the conclusion that Rowe’s bodies wereextraterrestrial.And there was another problem. Randle admitted that the original reason thatRowe submitted she was in Roswell during the Incident was for oral surgery. Butchecks with local dentists by various Roswell investigators have never been ableto confirm this.32 On the other hand, Rowe’s sister Helen Cahill was able toconfirm that she did hear stories of the crash during a visit to her family inNew Mexico in 1960.33 In the end, however, Rowe’s story has neither beenadvanced, nor completely discredited.A. ANNA WILLMON Anna Willmon was a firsthand witness to the Roswell Incident, and though hermemory “was not as sharp as it once had been,”34 her story is worth citing, asRandle presents it.> She told me, during both a telephone and later a taped videotaped interview,> that she had been in the Capitan Mountains west of Roswell with her first> husband, W.I. Witcamp. As they returned from a long morning of work at a> sawmill, they saw something shining off the highway and stopped to look for> it. They were about twenty miles from Roswell along what is known as the Pine> Lodge Road.> Together she and her husband moved through the brush until they came to an> object shaped like an overturned washtub, which means that it was circular, or> to stretch the point, saucer-like. She didn’t think it was very large, maybe> twelve to fifteen feet in diameter. She did see bodies of the flight crew, or> “little guys” as she called them.> She said that the surface of the craft was very shiny, almost mirrorlike. It> was in two pieces. One of them sat up on four short, stubby legs and the> other, looking as if it had been knocked from the top in the crash, was> sitting a short distance away. She insisted on calling it a flying saucer and> said that her husband had called it that repeatedly.> She didn’t see much of the creatures because as she approached one, with the> thought of turning it over, her husband stopped her. He was afraid of> radiation or maybe disease. He didn’t want her to touch them, or the remains> of the craft.> She said that there were two bodies: one lying face-down in the dirt and the> other in the shade of some cedar trees, as if he had crawled over there before> he died. The skin looked like burnt rubber. It was a grayish-brown, she said,> that was hard to define.> She said, “…that other one was laying up kinda towards this brush and the> other was out back… like he had been flung out of the thing. And this other> little guy looked like he’d got out and went off and laid down… And he wasn’t> very big. He was about a big as a little five-ear-old kid. A little one.”> She said that one of them was slim, skinny, with short arms and little hands> and feet. The other one, the one she thought might have survived the crash> only to die a little later, was chubby. His arms were short and his feet> looked like human feet. His skin tone matched those of the other. The only> real difference was that he was heavier than his fellows.> She said that they were dressed the same. They (wore) green shorts and nothing> else. She could see their backs and said that they looked normal. The skin was> rubber-like. But she made it clear that these were small creatures. She> mentioned that repeatedly.35 Other than the skin color and apparent texture (recall that Willmon did notactually touch the beings) there is nothing in these details, once again,compelling to the conclusion that they were extraterrestrials.But there are other problems, as Randle notes. Willmon’s “aliens” are somewhatdifferent than others’ descriptions. Moreover, “the timing of her story and thelocation, only twenty miles from Roswell and north of the Pine Lodge Road,doesn’t fit with other information that has been developed.”36 She admittedcontact with the military, but unlike other witnesses who claimed to have seenbodies, never mentioned that she or her husband had been threatened orintimidated into silence.37B. JOHNSON, THE DEBRIS, AND THE BODIES Another significant witness is a former member of the Roswell base’s 1395thMilitary Police Company, a man that Randle simply calls “sergeant Johnson,” toprotect his identity, though Johnson was not a sergeant at the time of theRoswell Incident, but the “acting corporal of the guard.”38 Randle states thateven though the man’s real surname is Johnson, it is such a common surname and“since his picture does not appear in the (Roswell base’s) Yearbook, it will bedifficult to trace him.”39 According to Johnson, while he was acting corporal ofthe guard, his unit> Received a telephone call that said there was a crash up near Corona. Johnson> was told to take a detail of four men but ended up taking about a dozen to> secure the site. They drove to Corona, talked to the police and a few people> to get directions and then drove out to the crash site. Johnson said that the> craft had impacted and was standing at a twenty-to thirty-degree angle from> the ground. He said, sort of confirming what Anna Willmon said, that the craft> was about twelve to fourteen feet in diameter and that it was very light, no> more than half a ton or maybe 1,200 pounds. Reflecting on it, he now suspects> the craft was made of some kind of composite material.> According to what he told John Carpenter, there were three dead creatures and> one that was alive. In a variation of a theme, Johnson said that the aliens> were wearing “what looked like a complete fabric covering over their bodies.”> It was silver colored.> He said the creatures were short, just over four feet tall and maybe weighed> ninety pounds. Their heads were covered by some kind of a hood but he could> see two oval-shaped eyes, and two holes where the nose would be, only lower on> the face. He said that there might have been glass or plastic or something> covering the eyes. They were a dark color that was so black that it looked to> be slightly blue…40> He said that the suit covered everything so that he couldn’t see the skin or> if there was hair on the head. He didn’t see enough, or remember enough to> describe hands or feet…> Johnson said that he, along with the men he had taken with him, were the only> people there the first night. He said that they didn’t sleep, not with the> alien creature walking around, though at some point it did lay down. He said> that he wasn’t sure if the alien had gone to sleep or not but though it had> remained awake because it seemed to be moving restlessly all the time.> According to Johnson, the bodies and the living creature were taken from the> site early the next morning. According to Johnson, the bodies, and later he> craft, were taken to Wright Field, now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in> Dayton, Ohio. He had no direct knowledge of this, but it was what he had been> told, or what he learned later.> Once his tour at the site was over, he, along with the others, were taken back> to Roswell. Johnson said that he hadn’t told his first wife about the crash> because he was under orders not to. Under questioning it became clear that he> was referring to a fairly standard warning given to all soldiers who hold a> top secret clearance. Sharing information with those not authorized to have it> could result in a big fine and up to twenty years in prison.> He did say, however, that every so often he would get a call reminding him of> his obligations. They would tell him he knew the rules and that he had> children.41 Other than the peculiarity about the creatures having apparently no nose, andnostrils slightly lower than normal, it is to be noted once again that nothingeither in Johnson’s descriptions of the crash, nor of the creatures, is sounusual as to compel to an extraterrestrial interpretation for them. But if thatis the case, why did the military continue to remind Johnson of his securityoath some time after the Incident?While military records clearly show that Johnson was indeed assigned to theRoswell air field in 1947 and was a member of the military police,42 Johnsonadmitted that he had had not only heart attacks but a stroke, and that hismemory “wasn’t as good as it once had been.”43 More importantly, StantonFriedman had forwarded copies of his reports and books to Johnson prior toJohnson’s first interview, “so that a case can be made that Johnson’s memory wascontaminated,”44 and in that respect, Randle notes that Johnson’s “darkblue-black eyes,” similar to discredited witness Gerald Anderson’s accounts,indicates that the possibility of contaminated memory must be entertained in hiscase.C. JORGENSON’S STORY: DRONE JETS, HIEROGLYPHICS, AND SOME DESCRIPTIONS Another witness Randle mentions in his latest book is Martin Jorgenson. Randlerecounts Jorgenson’s story in the following manner:> Martin Jorgensen walked into the International UFO Museum and Research Center> in Roswell and mentioned, off-hand, casually, that he had been around Roswell> in 1947. Don Burleson, a Roswell resident, happened to be in the museum at the> time and, according to Burleson, “(I) tackled the guy (almost literally).”> Sometimes called “Tex” by researchers, Jorgenson said that he was a civilian> working for the military and that he, along with his colleagues, stumbled onto> the site while searching for a drone jet aircraft that had been tested on July> 3 but that had crashed somewhere near Roswell. He, along with several NCOs,> had been told to find it.> As they neared the site, Jorgenson said that he saw pieces of bright silver> metal. The metal appeared to be very light and later he would learn quite> hard. He said that he saw some sort of writing, that is “hieroglyphics,” on> it.> The craft, he said, was stubby with curved-back wings. It was a small object,> about twenty feet long and only about 12 to 14 feet wide. It had the look of> some of the rocket ships in the old Buck Rogers serials.> There were three creatures. One was dead; one, though alive, was slumped over,> and the third was standing in the canopy looking at the men. They were small,> with a grayish, greenish skin, and dark slanted eyes. They had large heads and> small noses.> Unlike Willmon, but like others, Jorgenson said they were wearing uniforms, or> what might have been uniforms, but he wasn’t sure. He didn’t notice their> hands or their feeit.> Jorgenson said that he left the site shortly after the recovery began. He> returned to the base and there he was warned not to talk about what he had> seen. He said that he had to sign some kind of an oath or nondisclosure> agreement….45 Notably, Jorgenson does describe unusual physiological features on hiscreatures, the most notable being “greenish-gray skin.” This could indeed betaken as indicative of an extraterrestrial origin. The problem is, the craft hedescribes is a stubby craft “with curved back wings” and unusually smalldimensions, dimensions that are so small, in fact, that it is difficult toenvision the craft as anything practical for interplanetary travel, much lessinter-stellar travel.But like so many other witnesses, there is a “real concern about this story,”and that is that there are no records of any test of a drone jet aircraft thathad gone astray.46D. GONZALES’ ALIENS AND THE “SPACECRAFT” Thomas Gonzales was another witness impressed into service during the RoswellIncident, and he informed famous ufologist Don Ecker and fellow researcher JohnPrice that “he had seen the bodies of the alien creatures.”47 Gonzales’ familymade note of the fact that he began telling them the story in the 1960s, longbefore the Roswell Incident had become part of the wider culture.48 Gonzalesdescribed the “aliens” as “little men,” but definitely “not like the ‘Greys’(sic) of the more recent abduction literature.”49 Like Jorgenson, however, hisdescription of the craft would seem to belie any extraterrestrial origin, for hesaid it looked “more like an airfoil than it did like a saucer.”50E. PROVOST MARSHAL EDWIN EASLEY, AND BARTON’S BODIES, AIRCRAFT, AND RADIATION One of the most significant witnesses developed by subsequent research into theRoswell Incident was the 509th Bomb Group’s Provost Marshal, Edwin Easley. Asthe provost marshal, Easley was in charge of all the military police and all thesecurity functions connected with the base, and as such, if the stories of themilitary cordoning off the debris and crash sites were true, Easley likely hadthe principal role in doing so.51 Easley consistently maintained a discretesilence with Randle and other interviewers, insisting that he had been sworn tosecrecy. All he would confirm was that Mac Brazel had been “held at the guesthouse on the base.”52At the end of an interview with Easley, however, Randle asked him “if he thoughUFO researchers were following the right path.”53 Easley asked what Randle meantby this question, and Randle stated “We believed the craft found was ofextraterrestrial origin.” Easley’s answer was unusually cryptic, though Randle,of course, interprets it as being confirmation of the extraterrestrialhypothesis: “He then said, ‘Let me put it this way. That’s not the wrongpath.’”54 Randle then adds the following important information:> (Easley) went on from Roswell to a long career in the Air Force. He certainly> wasn’t the type of individual to invent such a tale. In fact, had he not been> sought out and interviewed, his role in the Roswell events would never have> been known. He didn’t come forward to find his place in the spotlight or see> himself on television. Because he was so reluctant to talk, his testimony> suggesting the craft was of extraterrestrial origin is extremely important.> The problem for skeptics, and frankly some of the believers, is that I didn’t> get Easley on tape saying this…. I called Easley to verify some things. I was> in the course of this conversation that he verified the idea that the craft> had been extraterrestrial.55 But did Easley in fact say this? He did not. He merely suggested that theextraterrestrial path was not the wrong path. But this does not imply that hemeant it was the right one either. There are other possibilities, and thesepossibilities are evident in the man that Randle next introduces ascorroboration of the Easley story, First Lieutenant Chester Barton.Barton related to researcher Joe Stefula that Major Easley had ordered him tothe crash site. But now note carefully what Barton actually stated, as Randlehimself recounts it:> …Barton said that it took them about forty-five minutes to get out to the> site, confirming a detail from Lewis Rickett. He said that they hit a> checkpoint, confirming still another detail.> The area was filled with parts of the craft and there was a burned area. The> best description that Barton could offer was that the debris looked like the> remains of a crashed aircraft. He did mention that some of the military police> were using Geiger counters and that they did detect some radiation in certain> spots.> Barton said that there weren’t any large pieces of it and no signs of a> propeller or engines. He said that it appeared as if the object had bounced> two or three times before it came to rest.> …> …> To be fair, it must be noted that Barton said, “Based on what I saw, I still> believe it was a B-29, I heard very little about the bodies. They were taken> to the hospital, but I didn’t see them. I know it was a hush-hush deal and> Easley told us to keep our mouths shut.”> …> It should be noted here that nearly everyone who has researched the crash> looked into the possibility of an aircraft accident. None of us found anything> like that. The Air Force, which would have much better access to such records,> did the same thing with the same results. There were no aircraft accidents,> not military, not civilian, and not experimental, that would account for the> strange debris.> So Easley’s testimony, corroborated by multiple sources, and especially that> from February 1991, is extremely important to understanding the nature of the> Roswell case. Had the object found been of mundane… (There’s that word-play again.)> …configuration, had it merely been an aircraft of some new design, or even a> weather balloon that had been launched as part of a top secret project, Easley> would have known simply because of who he was and what he did at Roswell. He> wouldn’t have been sworn to secrecy, and he certainly wouldn’t have said that> it was something extraterrestrial in origin… (And he did not.)> …if that hadn’t been the case.56 But let us look more closely at the corroborating witness whom Randle himselfintroduced to confirm his extraterrestrial interpretation of Easley’s crypticcomment.F. AN “ESTIMATION OF THE SITUATION” First, we note that Randle specifically asked Easley if the craft was of“extraterrestrial origin,” and that Easley cryptically replied that it was “notthe wrong path.” But this could mean a number of things, including merely thatthe craft had “off-planet capabilities,” and hence, in that sense, was of“extraterrestrial origin.”Indeed, the very witness, Barton, that Randle introduces as corroboration,maintained that what he saw looked “like the remains of a crashed aircraft, andmoreover, thought it was simply the remains of a crashed B-29 Superfortressbomber. This hardly qualifies as extraterrestrial.Finally, Randle himself observes that not only he but other Roswell researchers,including the Air Force itself, had checked records and could find no crashedmilitary, civilian, or experimental craft in that area and for that time. Butthis does not mean that whatever crashed was extraterrestrial, for if one takesthe statements of Randle’s own witness, Barton, seriously, and juxtaposes themwith Easley’s cryptic comment, this points not to an American origin of thecraft, but to some unknown terrestrial origin of it. In other words, somethingabout the craft was so unusual that to Easley, it looked extraterrestrial, butto Barton, something about it was so familiar that it looked terrestrial. And ifthere was no record of any sort of loss of an American craft, experimental orotherwise, then the possibility must be entertained that it was exotic thoughterrestrial, and possibly of an “extraterrestrial capability.”In my opinion, the wider ufology community, and the Roswell research communityin particular, has failed to consider this possibility adequately andthoroughly, and until it does, it may never solve the mystery.In point of fact, what one is now left with are the three basic facts of theRoswell Incident:> 1) “Something” crashed that was of an unusual nature, leaving debris with> partly familiar, partly exotic properties, that no balloon explanation> adequately explains, and that can lead witnesses who saw it to two different> conclusions, that it was “extraterrestrial” because of the exotic properties> of the debris, or that it was merely an “aircraft” and therefore terrestrial> because of its familiar properties. Moreover, in some descriptions of the> craft itself, there is an emphasis on the fact that it is an airfoil of some> sort, with some descriptions even emphasizing its short, small nature and> swept back wings. The dimensions of the craft would, similarly, appear to be> too small for any sort of practical interplanetary travel, and therefore, this> feature would tend to support its terrestrial origin, though something about> the craft is so unusual or exotic as to suggest to various witnesses it might> be extraterrestrial, or at least, have an off-world capability;> 2) The military recovered that “something,” and took great pains to maintain> secrecy about it, even though its origins were unclear. Moreover, as argued> earlier in this chapter, it would appear that both the original flying saucer> story and the later weather balloon story were disinformation, each> emphasizing one or another pole of whatever was recovered, the flying saucer> story emphasizing the unusual nature of what was recovered, and the weather> balloon story emphasizing the “ordinariness” of the object. As also argued> earlier, it would seem apparent that the latest balloon theory — the Mogul> balloon — fails to account adequately for the unusual nature of the debris. As> was also evident, the Air Force utterly failed to cite any witness description> of the debris that referred to its unusual or exotic properties, and thereby> more or less confirmed its second disinformation story, the one emphasizing> the ordinariness of the object;> 3) Finally, at a later point in the unfolding of the story, some witnesses> claim to have seen bodies. In some cases, the details provided would support> an extraterrestrial conclusion, but notably, in those cases, there is no> consistent description of physiological details that would support that> conclusion; whereas, in those cases that are more or less consistent, the> details do not compel to the conclusion that the bodies were in fact> extraterrestrial. As Randle himself aptly and succinctly puts it: “this was not a single-witnesscase with only some dim memory from that single witness, but a multiple-witnesscase with newspaper articles as limited corroboration that somethingextraordinary happened.”57 As mentioned previously, however, there is no logicalargument whatsoever that can lead from “the extraordinary” to the “necessarilyextraterrestrial,” just as there is no logical argument whatsoever that can leadfrom “the terrestrial” to “the ordinary.”3. THE AIR FORCE’S MOGUL INVESTIGATION: WHOM IT DID NOT INTERVIEW, AND WHY This brings us at last to a consideration of Randle’s replies to the skepticsand to the latest balloon theory. As noted in the previous chapter examining the“Roswell skeptics,” the Roswell base counter-intelligence office, SheridanCavitt, swore an affidavit indicating, contrary to Major Jesse Marcel Sr., thatthe debris field on the Foster ranch was rather small. Either Cavitt is wrong,or Marcel is wrong. But now, there is a problem with Cavitt’s story, and Randleis quick to spot what it is:> Remember, however, that Cavitt told Air Force investigators in the 1990s he> knew immediately what it was. He just never said anything about that to> Marcel, if we are to believe him now. Rather than say it was a balloon and> leave, he stayed with Marcel as Marcel attempted to identify the wreckage and> spent hours on the Debris Field.58 As we have already observed, it has been suggested by some that Marcel himselfonly began to ascribe specifically extraterrestrial characteristics to theunusual debris when it was suggested to him by UFO researchers, preferring, atfirst, simply to say that he did not know what it was, and maintaining that itwas “other-worldly,” i.e., highly unusual. In any case, Randle’s implication iscorrect: Cavitt’s story really makes no sense, for we are asked to believe thathe wasted his, and Marcel’s, time combing a balloon debris field for an entireday, a field that, by his own account, was very small.But there is another possibility that must now be mentioned: note that bothMarcel, and Cavitt, are each military men, and that each are maintaining bothpoles of that now familiar spectrum of stories regarding the debris, with Marcelemphasizing its unusual “extraterrestrial” nature, and Cavitt emphasizing itsordinariness. It is as if a careful dialectical opposition of interpretationshas been set up within the Incident from the start, a dialectic compelling toone of two interpretations, one toward an “extraterrestrial exaggeration,” andanother, its opposite, inclining towards a “skeptical pole”, an exaggeration ofthe merely ordinary qualities of the event. And if one wishes to press thisobservation, that very dialectic contains within it a potential solution: thatwhat happened was both entirely extraordinary, and entirely terrestrial, andthat it did not originate from the crash of something from this country. Suchdialectical techniques are typical in the process of “crisis management,” andthus, the presence of these dialectical poles within the Roswell Incident andthe initial stories of crashed flying saucers and misidentified weather balloonsare the surest indicator that the Air Force had a crisis on its hands, and wasdealing with it by utilizing all the standard tools of perception management andthe obfuscation of potential interpretations. They are the surest indicator thatthere was something approaching genuine panic within higher echelons of themilitary and the government. Thus, Randle is also very quick to perceive thetendentiousness in the Air Force’s latest balloon theory, and the fact that itemphasizes only one of those dialectical poles in the choice of witnesses itinterviewed. Not only did it fail to interview Brigadier General Arthur Exon(about whom more in Part Two),59 but as has been seen, it failed utterly tomention any of the descriptions of the debris given by Major Marcel, his son, orother witnesses who saw and handled it first-hand:> I know why the Air Force ignored all that testimony. No matter what we’ve seen> in the past, how various writers and investigators have handled the statements> made by Exon, DuBose, Easley, Marcel, and the others, the Air Force didn’t> want to be put in a position of calling retired officers liars. What if Exon> took offense at being labeled a liar and decided to sue? The consequences> would be ugly, no matter what was learned or what the truth was.> … The problem would remain that either high-ranking officers were fairly> incompetent, or were in fact liars.60 In other words, having stuck to one of those dialectical poles — the “ordinary”side — since its second official “weather balloon” explanation emanating fromGeneral Roger Ramey’s office in Fort Worth, the Air Force could not afford to beobjective in its examination of witness statements. Witnesses had to be selectedwho could buttress the new, more refined, Mogul balloon theory, a theory thatonly explains that particular pole of the evidence, while ignoring the“extraordinary” pole! And lest the significance of Randle’s insight goesunnoticed here, it is best to state it baldly, for that tendentiousness means ineffect that the dialectic of crisis management is still in place, and that meansthat whatever crisis the Roswell Incident signaled is also, to whatever extent,still ongoing.614. GENERAL DUBOSE In the previous chapter, it was seen that General Ramey’s then chief of staff,Colonel, later Brigadier General, Thomas J. Dubose completely discredited MajorJesse Marcel’s “Bait and Switch,” scenario, i.e., that the original Roswelldebris which had been spread out on General Ramey’s office floor was removed,and actual weather balloon debris substituted for it while Major Marcel andbriefly left the office. According to that scenario, when Marcel re-entered theoffice, much to his consternation and perplexity, he was ordered by GeneralRamey to have his picture taken with the new debris, and made the fall-guy inthe weather balloon explanation. This, of course, raises the significantquestion of why the Army Air Force would have as the intelligence officer of theonly atom bomb group in the world at that time a man who could not tell thedifference between weather balloons and “something else.”Randle raises a significant question in his recounting of the role of ColonelDuBose in this aspect of the Roswell Incident:> According to a statement signed in front of a state of Florida notary public,> Colonel DuBose received a telephone call from Maj. Gen. Clements McMullen, the> Deputy Commander of the Strategic Air Command, who asked about the events that> had occurred outside of Roswell. DuBose, in turn, called Blanchard in Roswell> and ordered him to send the material, in a sealed container, to him at Fort> Worth. It was never made clear if this was some of the stuff that was brought> to Roswell by (Mac) Brazel, or if it was some of the debris recovered by> Marcel. The timing, based on what DuBose said during his videotaped interview> made in August 1991, would indicate that it was some of the Brazel debris.62 Now, however, the details between DuBose interview with Jamie Shandera, and hisearlier interviews, begin to surface:> DuBose also identified the material photographed in Ramey’s office as part of> a weather balloon. DuBose said that the weather balloon explanation was a> cover story designed to divert attention of the press. Please note here that> we have testimony from a high-ranking officer who was in the office at the> time, telling us that the debris displayed there was a weather balloon. He> would make it clear that this debris was not the strange stuff that had been> found in New Mexico.> In interviews conducted in the early 1990s, and videotaped for inclusion in> the Fund for UFO Research’s video library, DuBose elaborated. He added that> McMullen ordered Ramey to cover up the whole thing. They, meaning those at a> higher command level, wanted to “put out the fire” as quickly as they could.> Speaking of the orders he received from McMullen, DuBose said, “He (McMullen)> called me and said that I was… there was talk of some elements that had been> found on the ground outside Roswell, New Mexico…that the debris or elements> were to be placed in a suitable container and Blanchard was to see that they> were delivered…they were placed in a suitable contained and Al Clark, the base> commander at Carswell (Fort Worth Army Air Field) would pick them up and hand> deliver them to McMullen in Washington. Nobody, and I must stress this, no one> was to discuss with their wives, me with Ramey, with anyone. The matter as far> as we’re concerned was closed as of that moment.”> DuBose then called Blanchard in Roswell, “…and told him that there is this> material his S-2 (Marcel) found in the desert and I said this is to be put in> a suitable container by this major and you are to see that it is sealed, put> in your little command aircraft, and flown by a proper courier (meaning an> officer or NCO who is cleared to carry classified material), flown to Carswell> and delivered to Al Clark who will then deliver it to McMullen.”> Because it was hot that day, DuBose waited in his office until he was told> that the aircraft from Roswell was in the traffic pattern. Once he had the> word, he drove out onto the ramp and waited for the airplane to land. He> couldn’t remember whether it was a B-25 or a B-26, but did say he knew it> wasn’t a B-29. McMullen would not have approved of using one of the bombers.> As the plane rolled to a stop, Col. Alan Clark walked over and received the> bag from the Roswell crew. DuBose said, “Clark took the package and got into> the B-26 (or B-25, the Fort Worth plane standing by) through the belly of it…> he handed it to somebody…it was one of those things you tied to your wrist and> he handed it to somebody and climbed in there. And that’s the last I saw of> it. In a couple… three hours it was delivered to McMullen and that’s the last> I heard of it.”63 And that, notes Randle, was also the only package according to DuBose, who madeit clear “that the debris in the bag was different from the debris that wouldlater be displayed in Ramey’s office.”64 In other words, there was a “bait andswitch” scenario taking place in Fort Worth, only it was not exactly as Marcelremembered it, for the unusual debris left for Washington DC and GeneralMcMullen.655. RANDLE’S LATEST SUMMATION OF THE INCIDENT The overall impact of the skeptics’ case, and of the Air Force’s recent attemptsto interpret the Roswell Incident as the crash of nothing more than an ordinaryMogul balloon, have left the Roswell Incident with more or less the three basicelements enumerated above. Randle puts it this way:> Where does all this leave us? The best tales told about Roswell, those that> brought in alien bodies in a firsthand sense, have since been shown to be> faked. Kaufmann, Anderson, Dennis, and Ragsdale, who said they had seen the> bodies (or in Dennis’s case, a drawing of them), were later discovered to have> invented their Roswell connections.> Not only has this left a hole in the Roswell case, but it provides the> skeptics with the ammunition to sink the whole report. They can point to the> testimony of any of these men and say, “See, they were making it up and they> fooled you.”> The response will be that we who have investigated the Roswell case were the> ones to expose these reports for what they were. The skeptics stood on the> sidelines without having to get their hands dirty. So, yes, these men have> been exposed, but remember who did the work to expose them.66 While this is true, as has also been seen from Randle’s latest Roswell book,there still remain witnesses who describe — albeit inconsistently — seeingbodies, but more importantly, there still remains the thorny problem of thedebris, and the military’s rather heavy-handed reaction if that debris simplyrepresented a mere balloon, whether a weather balloon, Mogul balloon, or anyother type of balloon. None of those explanations accounts for the unusualproperties of that debris nor the military’s “panicked” reaction to it.But what could be so sensational about mere exotic debris that the Air Forcewould perpetuate a cover-up to this day? What about it was so advanced, or soexplosive, or both, that would require such a thing? The answer to that questionmay lie in an elaborate movie hoax, an even more elaborate “hoax” from alieutenant colonel, a telegram, and the ultimate in Roswell hoaxes: a set ofmysterious “leaked” documents and their contents that — while the Roswellcommunity battles over issues of their provenance and authenticity — no oneseems to bother to read…image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Kevin Randle, Roswell Revisited (Lakeville, Minnesota: Galde Press, Inc.,2007), p. 55.2 Captain James McAndrew, The Roswell Report: Case Closed (Barnes and Noble,1997), p. iii.3 This also means that one can hardly fault Captain McAndrew for his research,for the peculiar nature of the flaw was, as will be seen momentarily, not yetevident to the wider Roswell research community.4 McAndrew, The Roswell Report: Case Closed, p. 1.5 Ibid.6 Ibid.7 McAndrew, The Roswell Report: Case Closed, p. 1.8 Ibid.9 Ibid.10 McAndrew, The Roswell Report: Case Closed, p. 69.11 McAndrew, The Roswell Report: Case Closed, p. 8.12 McAndrew, The Roswell Report: Case Closed, p. 53.13 McAndrew, The Roswell Report: Case Closed, p. 52.14 McAndrew, The Roswell Report: Case Closed, Figures 21 and 22, p. 114.15 McAndrew, The Roswell Report: Case Closed, p. 11416 Randle, Roswell Revisited, p. 19, emphasis added.

Korff1 Thus far the story of the Roswell Incident is fairly straightforward; there arethe various “articulations” of the story with their various emphases; there arethe various witnesses and even various “fake” witnesses; there are the believersand skeptics. But there are other elements that entered the Roswell story ratherlate, after the main “articulations” had been more or less nailed down and theirtimelines fixed. Like everything else associated with the Roswell Incident,these four things spanned the entire spectrum of credibility, from the carnivalatmosphere of the Alien Autopsy Hoax, to more serious attempts to utilize theadvances in technology to read the telegram being held by Brigadier GeneralRoger Ramey at the famous “weather balloon” press conference in Fort Worth,Texas; to claims somewhere between those two extremes, such as the only slightlyless carnival atmosphere of Lt. Colonel Philip Corso’s claims he helped head aproject to reverse-engineer and seed all the fantastic recoveredextraterrestrial technology into American industry; to more serious claims ofallegedly leaked “Top Secret” documents that purported to be from a highlyclassified UFO study group called Majic-12 or Majestic-12 established as aresult of the Roswell Incident. In this chapter, we shall deal with the extremeson either end of the spectrum, the Alien Autopsy Carnival, and the attempts todecipher the document in General Ramey’s hand in the now famous photograph ofhim kneeling next to the debris of a weather balloon. In the next chapter weshall turn to an analysis of the claims of Lt. Colonel Corso, and in Part Two weshall examine the controversies surrounding the Majic-12 documents, beforeturning finally to a presentation of the Nazi Scenario in Part Three.A. THE ALIEN AUTOPSY CARNIVAL1. KORFF’S AND FRIEDMAN’S INVOLVEMENT The now notorious and infamous Alien Autopsy film that was aired by the Foxtelevision network in the mid-1990s seems to have a life of its own,notwithstanding the efforts of serious ufologists and Roswell Incidentresearchers to demonstrate its completely amateurish and hoaxed nature.Fortunately, both Stanton T. Freidman and Kal Korff were involved in trying toestablish the credibility of the alien autopsy almost from the inception of thestory, and therefore their analysis will be followed here.The story began when a British rock star - Reg Presley of the group called TheTroggs - revealed on a BBC morning television show that he had seen actual filmof an autopsy being conducted on the extraterrestrials recovered from theRoswell crash of 1947. “Shortly thereafter, a British video producer named RaySantilli stepped forward and announced that he had purchased actual autopsy anddebris footage from an elderly cameraman who had filmed it all.”2 And with that,the autopsy carnival was in business.Santilli arranged a “preview” of the film at the London Museum on May 5, 1995for selected members of the media and various ufologists. His purpose, accordingto Korff, was clear, for he then intended to use the preview to “launch abidding war to sell the broadcast rights to the highest bidder in as manycountries as possible.”3 Prior to this event, however, Stanton T. Friedman hadbeen doing preliminary investigation of his own.Contacted by a friend in Great Britain who had seen the original televisionshow, Friedman tracked the film’s owner, Ray Santilli, down and spoke with himby phone.4 Friedman relates that Santilli “claimed he had done two years’research about Roswell to establish the validity of the cameraman and hisfootage, although this was the first time he had heard my name and he wasunfamiliar with the MJ-12 documents.”5 This was the beginning of Santilli’sserious credibility problems, for no one researching Roswell - then or now -could avoid coming across the name of Stanton Friedman, or the Majic-12documents.The other serious difficulty was that Santilli told Friedman that PresidentTruman himself was visible in the film, going on to volunteer that Truman was“in Dallas at the time of the autopsy.”6 Friedman quickly determined that theclaims were beginning to smell fishy, for “why would Truman want to go see thealiens himself? He trusted his advisors...I couldn’t imagine Truman wanting toget involved, what with all the logistic problems of keeping it secret.”7 Butthere was another problem. When Friedman checked the Truman library, thepresident was not anywhere near Texas or New Mexico “between June and October of1947.”8In any case, one of the journalists in attendance at Santilli’s preview was aformer television producer for the NBC television series, “Unsolved Mysteries”and subsequently a producer for the Fox network’s “Encounters” series, RobertKiviat. Kiviat had departed from Fox Television and was looking for excitingmaterial that he could use as he was also starting his own production company,and the alien autopsy film was perfect for his purposes.Also in the running for the film, however, was Friedman, acting as arepresentative for the then prominent alternative radio network, Chuck Harder’s“For the People Network,” for rights to market the film, “contingent on(Friedman’s) acceptance of the footage as genuine and access to the cameraman”that had allegedly filmed the autopsy.9Kiviat met privately with Santilli after the London Museum preview, and the twoeventually reached an agreement when Santilli sold exclusive first broadcastrights to the film to Kiviat’s production company, Kiviat-Green Productions, forthe tidy sum of $125,000.10 Kiviat in turn reached an agreement with his formeremployer, Fox Television, shortly thereafter. Fox would air a one-hour specialon the film.11Santilli was also busy getting ready to market a videocassette of the autopsyfilm under the title “Roswell: The Footage,” for the “tidy price of $59, plusshipping and handling.”12 (The film, in its cassette version, even made a briefcameo appearance on the Fox Network’s popular UFO-related series, “The X Files,”but not even Fox Mulder could be induced to believe it had any credibility!)Korff’s involvement with the Alien Autopsy Carnival came about because he andKiviat had collaborated on an earlier project for the Fox Network’s “Encounters”series. Korff headed a think tank called Total Research, and he volunteered itsservices to Kiviat, who accepted them, requesting that Korff “start puttingtogether an analytical game plan in order to try and authenticate the alienautopsy footage. We joked about the fact that I was going to be the ‘ForensicUFOlogist’ in the affair...”13 According to Korff, Kiviat’s initial idea was“for a live, one-hour simultaneous broadcast in both the United States and GreatBritain, with a variety of medical and film experts, who would collectivelyanalyze the material. By the end of the show, everyone would know what theverdict was.”14However, this did not last long:> The production in which I was eagerly looking forward to participating began> to evaporate.> Almost immediately, I received several telephone calls from mutual> acquaintances in the UFO field who had been in touch with Kiviat. The scope of> the production was changing, and because certain forensic and analytical> issues which could have definitely settled the authenticity issue of the alien> autopsy footage once and for all were now being bypassed, I began to see that> there would be no role for either TotalResearch or myself.... However,> Kiviat’s hands were being shrewdly tied by Ray Santilli, in part because he> would not provide any original film with images of the alien on it for proper> scientific testing and age dating.15 Santilli’s credibility and that of his film thus suffered a further blow.Finally, in August of 1995 the film finally aired on Fox, under the title “AlienAutopsy: Fact or Fiction?” But as Korff observes, without the involvement of anyserious researchers in the production, and with no actual forensic testing beingdone on the film itself, there was little resolution to the issue of itsauthenticity or lack thereof in the program.16But the show was wildly successfulin terms of its ratings, and the Fox network ordered a second airing, for whichKiviat supplied some additional material.17 While Kiviat did indeed listen toKorff’s objections and critiques of the film, even going to far as to inviteKorff to be filmed for an analysis for the second airing, production andscheduling problems prevented Korff’s opinions from ever being aired.182. KORFF’S AND FRIEDMAN’S CRITIQUES OF THE FILM Despite these shortcomings within the Fox productions of the film, Korff wasable to conduct an analysis that all but destroys any hope that the “alienautopsy” is genuine. The first problem is that Ray Santilli claimed that theautopsy was originally filmed with a “Bell and Howell Filmo 70 spring-loaded,manually wound camera.” The problem is that when film in this camera is started,the mechanical spring-driven film takes a while to come up to speed, thusproducing “hot flash” frames at the beginning that are over-exposed due to thefilm traveling slower through the camera. But “Santilli’s alien autopsy filmdisplays no such hot flashes!”19 Additionally, autopsies are normally filmedwith a stationary camera directly above the body to afford a full view of thebody, and with continuous filming. In the Santilli film, the cameraman movesconstantly and also constantly starts and stops the film, producing cuts in theaction at crucial points.20 Santilli also claimed that the film was shot with an85 filter. But this makes no sense either, as the 85 filter s used for colorfilming, and Santilli’s “alien autopsy” film is shot in black and white!21But the real arguments against the authenticity of the film come within the filmitself and the “procedures” it shows. For one thing, during the film thecameraman repeatedly shows a clock on the wall, and according to this,> the entire dissection of the alien took roughly two and a half hours! This is> a remarkably short period of time considering the fact that we’re supposedly> dealing with an extraterrestrial here. One would assume that a real autopsy of> an alien would take weeks, if not months. It would be a one-time historic> opportunity, one that would not be rushed or hurried.22 Nor is this all. As Korff notes, during autopsies the cadaver is normally placedon a small block beneath the back that helps to arch the body, pushing the chestupward and allowing easier access to the chest cavity. But in Santilli’s film,the body lies flat on the table.23As for the “alien body” itself, it seems to be rather stocky and muscular, butwhen the “pathologists” open it up, Korff somewhat humorously observes that “itsinternal organs are just sitting in the body as if they are dumplings floatingin a bowl of soup!”24 Nor is that all. During normal autopsies, when organs orportions thereof are removed, they are always placed in glass jars “to avoidpotential contamination.” Yet, in Santilli’s “autopsy” film, they are placedinto metal pans. Moreover, the alien, who is supposed to have been dead forseveral days, bleeds easily, whereas bodies that have been dead for only a fewhours bleed less easily, as the blood and fluids in them begin to settle due tothe force of gravity.25But perhaps the real telltale internal evidence that the film is a fraud and ahoax is the fact that the scissors are not even being held as a doctor orpathologist would hold them. Korff reproduces the following two frames in hisphoto inset:image [images/00024.jpg] The “Alien Autopsy” Footage of the “Doctor” Holding Surgical Scissors26 image [images/00025.jpg] Actual Doctor Holding Surgical Scissors correctly27 It is worth citing Korff himself on the significance of this crucial comparison:> In real autopsies, the scissors are held in one’s hand with the thumb and> middle finger. the index finger is used to steady the scissors. However...in> the alien autopsy film, the “pathologist” is holding the scissors the wrong> way - as if he’s cutting a piece of paper, using the thumb and index finger to> hold them. This is laughable.28 In fact, it’s so laughable that Korff’s own summary cannot be improved upon:> Imagine this, the most important autopsy ever conducted, and the “specialists”> don’t follow even the most basic of procedures: They can’t hold their> instruments correctly and they don’t elevate their corpse!29 Even the “alien” himself (or herself, we’re never really sure), bears a closerlook:image [images/00026.jpg] Santilli’s “Roswell Alien” image [images/00027.jpg] Santilli’s “Roswell Alien” Friedman notes that “the bodies in the film looked nothing like any aliensdescribed to me by either Roswell eyewitnesses or abductees. None of thewitnesses I interviewed mentioned aliens with six fingers, but there they wereon each hand in the film.”30 Friedman also noted that, while the body in the“alien autopsy” film might be considered unusual enough to be thought of asextraterrestrial, it looked more human than anything else, notwithstanding itssexedigitism:> It could have been a real autopsy of a real earthling with a genetic defect> such as Turner’s Syndrome. The body seemed to be short, definitely female, but> with no breasts; with unusual earlobes, a wide chest, and what seemed to be a> somewhat webbed neck; i.e., more skin at the bottom than at the top. These> characteristics, plus the unusual palate, the angle of the elbow, the length> of the cranial bones, and others, all suggest Turner’s. The eyes were large,> but not like those described so often for aliens. There was a dark flap lifted> off the eyes by the surgeons, but it apparently was not actually attached.> Eyewitnesses have generally described the aliens as having holes for noses and> ears rather than an almost normal human nose and real ear flaps, as shown in> the footage.31 Notwithstanding the fact that Friedman does not mention the proceduraldifficulties of the film noted by Korff, he does note that the body in the filmdoes not match any known Roswell “alien” description.And let us note one other thing about Friedman’s observation here; the apparentsexedigitism of the “creature” is apparently not enough to cause Friedman toignore the resemblance between the autopsy film’s creature and a purelyterrestrial human syndrome, and to note its unusual terrestrialcharacteristics.32 This will become our own method in Part Three, when we turnto examine the descriptions of the “aliens” from Friedman’s own witnesses.In the end, the “Alien Autopsy” film episode was just an entertaining carnival,and we concur in Korff’s conclusion that it lacks any credibility. It wasnothing more than an amusing episode and distraction in the Roswell Incidentstory, and therefore it will not enter our considerations any further in thisbook.33B. GENERAL ROGER RAMEY’S TELEGRAM1. THE DISCOVERED “MESSAGES” Technology has a way of undoing the best of conspiracies. For example, as is nowwell known, Mary Moorman was standing in Dealey Plaza on that Friday morning,November 22, 1963, taking photographs of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy’smotorcade. Decades later, using blowups and the best computer enhancementtechniques, a photograph that Moorman had snapped was shown to contain all butconclusive evidence that there had indeed been a gunman on the “Grassy Knoll”apparently firing a high powered rifle from a position behind the picket fence.The enhancements also revealed that he was apparently disguised in a Dallaspoliceman’s uniform, for what appears to be a police badge is visible in thepicture. The picture also shows the muzzle flash of the gun.In what is something of an irony, the other most-obfuscated event in modernAmerican history - the Roswell Incident - likewise contains a photograph whichhas now become the focus of a similar technological scramble to expose anddecipher its contents. That photograph is the now-famous photograph of BrigadierGeneral Roger Ramey crouching next to his chief of staff, then Colonel Thomas J.DuBose, next to a pile of actual weather balloon debris.image [images/00028.jpg] Brigadier General Roger Ramey, crouching and holding a Piece of Paper. His Chiefof Staff, then-Colonel Thomas J. DuBose, is seated in the Chair next to him. The piece of paper that General Ramey held that day has now become the focus ofan intense effort on the part of Roswell researchers, for by using the sametechniques of blowups, computer enhancements and a variety of analyticaltechniques, some of them claim to have deciphered at least some of the contentsof that piece of paper.Foremost of these researchers is David Rudiak, who has devoted a great deal oftime to the effort.34 According to his analysis, the paper is apparently atelegram from Ramey to General Hoyt Vandenberg who, at that time, was the actingArmy Air forces Chief of Staff. According to Rudiak, the message contains thefollowing key phrases:> 1) “that a ‘disk’ is next new find;”> 2) “the victims of the wreck;”> 3) “a wreck;”> 4) “operation at the ‘ranch’;”> 5) “victims” and “wreckage” (were to be) “forwarded” (to) “Fort Worth, Tex;”> 6) “in the ‘disc’;”> 7) “aviators;”> 8) “AI,” (that is, the personnel director) of some department of “8th army;”> 9) “airfoil;”> 10) “misstate meaning of story;”> 11) “CIC/team;”> 12) “next sent out PR” (or press release);> 13) “weather balloons.”35 A careful consideration of Rudiak’s version of the message reveals somesignificant clues, namely, that the crew is referred to as “victims” and“aviators” and that the craft, referred to twice as a “disc” is also oncereferred to as an “airfoil.” None of these details compel to the conclusion — ifRudiak’s version of the message is indeed correct — that Roswell was somethingextraterrestrial. On the contrary, the use of the words “airfoil” and “aviators”suggests something eminently terrestrial.Rudiak himself makes no claims to the probabilities of his decoding, only to itspossibilities. In fact, Rudiak admits that “the only thing not made explicit isthe exact nature of the bodies or ‘disc.’ Ramey probably does not refer to thebodies as ‘nonhuman,’ ‘alien,’ or some similar term. Nor does he use terms like‘spaceship,’ ‘craft of unknown origin,’ etc. to describe the ‘disc.’”36 At thisjuncture, like many other Roswell researchers, Rudiak observes that many haveargued that Roswell might have been the crash of some government black projectsexperimental craft, but indicates that “nobody has ever presented evidence thatsuch an experimental disk — like craft ever existed or was tested in New Mexicoat that time.”37 As will be seen in Part Three, this is not entirely true. Bythe same token, it is also not true that Roswell — if of terrestrial origin —need have been the crash of something American. After all, as other Roswellresearchers have pointed out — Berliner and Friedman among them as we have seen— the fact that the military did not undertake any search for the craft until itwas informed of its existence by rancher Mac Brazel would seem to preclude thepossibility that it was American.38 Finally, Rudiak repeats the arguments ofothers that, even if it wase terrestrial, the fact that that it has not beendeclassified would, in his opinion, represent the fact that it was unlikely tobe terrestrial, since no terrestrial technology could presumably be so advancedas to maintain classification of the event and its associated technologies tothis day.This of course begs the question, for as has been noted throughout previouschapters, there is no necessary logical argument that leads from “theextraordinary” to “the extraterrestrial origin” of it, nor any logical argumentthat leads from “the terrestrial” to “the ordinary.” And it begs the question inanother significant way, for the assumption is that the only reason formaintaining such strict classification to this day would be a technological one.But as will be seen in Part Three, there may well be political reasons for doingso as well.2. HOURAN’S AND RANDLE’S CRITIQUE Needless to say Rudiak is not the only such researcher attempting to decode theRamey message, but he is perhaps the best known, and for that reason we havefocused on his work here. However, the journalist who first took the Rameyphotograph, D. Bond Johnson, decided in 1998 to investigate the photograph onhis own, using similar techniques. In his version, the message read as follows:> AS THE... 4 HRS THE VICTIMS OF THE ... AT FORT WORTH, TEX... THE “CRASH”> STORY... FOR 0984 ACKNOWLEDGES... EMERGENCY POWERS ARE NEEDED SITE TWO SW OF> MAGDALENA, NMEX... SAFE TALK... FOR MEANING OF STORY AMD MISSION... WEATHER> BALLOONS SENT ON THE ... AND LAND ... rOVER CREWS... (SIGNED)...TEMPLE.39 Roswell researcher Kevin Randle has the distinction of holding a PhD inpsychology, and he and fellow psychologist James Houran decided to study theRamey message decoding, for it holds some interesting psychologicalimplications, for obviously the Ramey memo, if it could be decoded, would havepotentially enormous implications for the Roswell case, for the document was of“an indisputable provenance.”40 The only problem — as is evident from thedifferences between Rudiak’s and Johnson’s “decodings” — was that “many of thosedoing the work were not seeing the same things as Johnson had claimed.”41 Oneresearcher who investigated the Ramey message even accused the others of “seeingfaces in the clouds,” or in this case, a decodable message in the smudges thatresulted even under the best of blowups and computer enhancements.42Randle notes that the attempts to decode the message can hardly be viewed asobjective, since “those who seem to have a specific agenda are seeing in thememo exactly what they expect (so see).”43 Randle also observed that there weresignificant problems in all the attempts to decode the message, because as amilitary message “sent from one military installation to another,” it would bythe very nature of that circumstance have to have contained “some militaryjargon in it,”44 and yet no attempted decoding contained such jargon. EvenRudiak himself observed that his own decoding used civilian, rather thanmilitary, usage of time.45Additionally, there is “the classification problem.” As Houran and Randle putit, “Nearly everyone agrees that Roswell—related message traffic would have beenclassified, particularly if the event involved the crash of an extraterrestrialcraft.”46 In spite of this, no one involved in the work of trying to decode theRamey message had suggested or “decoded” any such declassification markings!> In fact, it seems strange that Ramey, a general officer who had handled> classified material long before this event, would be so cavalier in handling> this message. Before crouching by the wrecked weather balloon and radar target> in his office, had he held a classified message, he would have given it to his> aide, he would have set it in his desk drawer, or he would have had it locked> in the safe by his secretary. That is the proper way to handle classified> material, and Ramey would not have likely made such an elementary mistake,> especially with a camera and a reporter in his office.47 In fact, as Houran and Randle also are careful to point out, the reporter whofirst took the famous picture and later undertook to decode the message, alsosaid that he himself had handed General Ramey the message, and that it was an APwire message his own boss had given to him about the Roswell Incident. As such,“it would be a document from a civilian source” and thus “would contain nothingto establish the reality of a UFO crash.”48 In other words, “the message couldbe about almost anything, could be from almost anywhere, and the words andimages being seen might be a reflection of what the researcher wanted to seerather than what is actually there.”49Houran and Randle decided to test this hypothesis and set up three differentstudy groups in which they asked participants to decode the Ramey memo. Thefirst group was told that the message might contain information relating to theRoswell cover—up. The second group was told that the message might containinformation about the testing of the atom bomb. Finally, a third group was toldnothing at all about what the contents of the message might be nor what it mightpertain to.50 Each individual in each group was informed individually about the“suggestion conditioning” of his group prior to being seated in a quiet room.Once there, they were allowed to view an 8” x 10” enlarged print of the portionof the Ramey photograph showing the message. No time limit was imposed on any ofthe participants.51The results of their study were rather interesting. Group 1, the group that wastold that the message might contain information relating to the RoswellIncident, spent the most time in the effort to “decipher” it, and also“deciphered” the most words. Group 2, the group that was told the messagecontained information about atom bomb testing, “deciphered” slightly fewerwords, and spent slightly less time doing so. Group 3, the group that was givenabsolutely no hints about the contents of the message, spent the least amount oftime and deciphered the fewest words.52 But the most surprising result was thatnot only did all three groups find parts of the document legible, but that“participants across the three groups did show consensus on several words inidentical locations and in the same locations in the document that previousinvestigators also had agreed upon...”53 Nonetheless, in spite of thisagreement, “the meaning or context of those words” that were agreed upon acrossall three groups “remains ambiguous because the degree of interpretation of thedocument is strongly influenced by suggestion effects...”54 Houran and Randlemince no words as to what the study implies for the deciphering effortsurrounding the Ramey memo:> In fact, ufologists are probably among the least effective people to be trying> to decipher the document. This opinion stems from our observation that one of> the main factors arguably influencing the number of words deciphered in this> study is the motivation of the participants. Note that those in the Pro — UFO> condition spent more time examining the images and subsequently perceived the> greatest number of words in the Ramey memo.55 While this conclusion would certainly seem to be warranted by the results thatHouran and Randle obtained from their study, it should be noted that none of thedeciphering attempts specifically refer to “crashed extraterrestrial craft” or“extraterrestrial beings.”In fact, as was seen with Rudiak’s and Johnson’s attempts, the results were farshort of compelling to any extraterrestrial interpretation, and in Rudiak’sversion, some of the specific wording — “airfoil” and “aviators” — even seemedto suggest a more terrestrial origin, so Rudiak at least cannot be accused ofbias or agenda, for he is very much in the pro — extraterrestrial camp forinterpreting the Roswell Incident. Nonetheless, the case, as it now stands, isneither advanced nor hindered by the attempts to decode the Ramey telegram (ifin fact it is a telegram). Like the Alien Autopsy Carnival, completenessrequired it be mentioned, but like the Alien Autopsy Carnival, it will not bementioned again in this book, save for a brief reappearance in Part Three.For now, our focus must be on the problematical case of Lt.

(Ret.) Philip J. Corso3 Most of the serious and reputable Roswell researchers, both “believers” and“skeptics,” regard the claims and assertions of retired U.S. Army Colonel PhilipJ. Corso in his book The Day After Roswell as being a bit of melodramatic andself-serving megalomania at worst, or absurdity at best, and as such, thetendency now in most Roswell research circles is to ignore Corso’s book and itswild claims. Only a few die-hard Roswell fundamentalists cling doggedly to thebook’s assertions. For the rest, the claims of Corso - a career armyintelligence officer - were simply laughable. The criticisms of StantonFriedman, himself a credentialed nuclear physicist, and a man with practicalengineering experience in the black projects world, were telling: Why would theU.S. Army entrust the analysis and reverse-engineering of a recoveredextra-terrestrial craft and its technologies to a (then) mere lieutenant colonelwith absolutely no engineering or science background? To a credentialed nuclearengineer like Friedman, who had spent time in black projects dealing withclassified and, for that matter, dangerous, material, Corso’s claims were simplytoo incredible to be taken seriously.Others pointed out that Colonel Corso had literally hoodwinked the late U.S.Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond, into writing an introduction forhis book. Thurmond did indeed do so, but he thought he was writing anintroduction for a book of “memoirs,” not a book about Roswell. Needless to say,when the Senator’s office found out about the “bait and switch,” it was furious,and demanded that Corso’s publisher withdraw the introduction. Simon andSchuster did so, but Corso’s credibility had taken major damage from theepisode.Still others pointed to “tendencies to exaggerate” within Corso’s character, andto the fact that Corso’s motivations for writing the book appeared simply to beto make money, a fact that the late colonel himself acknowledged in severalinterviews, claiming he wanted to leave his grandchildren a legacy.Yet others point to the fact that in his presentation of the Roswell Incident,Corso relies on the witnesses of Randle’s and Schmitt’s “revisionist scenario”and thus relies, as we shall see, on impeached witnesses like Frank Kaufman, orwitnesses whose story has never been successfully verified, like Frankie Rowe.As such, it could be argued that Corso’s reconstruction of the Incident —already on wobbly and incredible foundations to begin with — is constructed onthe unstable fault lines of dubious testimony.Others point out that Corso was in a certain sense, another Frank Kaufman,literally claiming to be involved, like Walter Mitty, in the center of almostevery major conspiracy and event in modern postwar history. When Corso died hewas rumored to be working on another book — The Day After Dallas — detailing hisrole in the secret investigations into the assassination of President John F.Kennedy.So why pay attention to a completely discredited and somewhat impeached witnessat all, especially when so many serious researchers have pointed out the obviousand patent difficulties of his story?The answer lies in the fact that few pointed to Corso’s intelligence background,and thus few acknowledged the possibility that, like Major Jesse Marcel, he mayhave been carrying out his “last orders,” even at the end of his life, inwriting his book and telling “his story.” Consequently, few have acknowledgedthe possibility that Corso’s book, rather than being a complete and totalfabrication from beginning to end, is a book not so much of lies andfabrications as it is a book of disinformation, of exaggerations, of halftruths, of sleight of hand and misdirection. Equally possible is that his bookis also a “confession,” a confession done in such a way that he is perhapsattempting — within the limitations of whatever security oaths he was stillunder and in the form of whatever obfucation and disinformation he may have beenattempting to promulgate — to give subtle and not-so-subtle clues as to where tolook to find the “real” story. Either way, Corso’s own son, Philip J. Corso,Jr., pointed out that the book was ninety percent fabrication, and that meant,that it was ten percent truth.4 The question is, which ten percent is it?Oddly enough, that ten percent is in those portions of the book where Corsopoints a none-too-subtle finger towards the terrestrial resemblances of thecraft, and in doing so, where he just as clearly denies that any mundane “Mogul”balloon interpretation is an adequate interpretation.To put it succinctly, looked at a different way, it would appear that the samescenario was being replayed in the mid-1990’s as was played out that July 8,1947 in New Mexico and Texas, for on the one hand, the Air Force was busilypublishing its “balloon story” under “official auspices,” and on the other, Armyofficers with intelligence connections — in this case Corso, and not Marcel —were busily putting out publications claiming that the Army had recovered aflying saucer and thus its associated technologies.So once again: why pay attention to Corso at all?Because of that ten percent, and because that ten percent clearly suggests theplace where the Roswell debris came from, a place that was a very terrestrial,and a politically explosive, point of origin. One must look at Corso becausethat ten percent suggests that far from being just another Frank Kaufman on theRoswell landscape out for a quick buck and a place in history, he was alsoeither attempting one final military obfuscation of the incident by cloakingthat genuine ten percent inside a context and a story so laughable that, onceagain, Roswell researchers would overlook it and discount it, for while Corsoclearly points a finger to the extraterrestrial origins of the recoveredtechnology, he just as clearly points a finger, repeatedly, to Nazi Germany.A. A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF CORSO’S STORY So, for those who do not know it, what exactly is Corso’s story?Corso maintains that he inherited the Foreign Technology Desk Research andDevelopment at the Pentagon in 1961. In that capacity, he was approached by hiscommanding officer, General Arthur Trudeau. General Trudeau asked Corso> to use the army’s ongoing weapons development and research program as a way to> filter the Roswell technology into the mainstream of industrial development> through the military defense contracting program. Today, items such as lasers,> integrated circuitry, fiber optics networks, accelerated particle-beam> devices, and even the Kevlar material in bulletproof vests are all> commonplace. Yet the seeds for the development of all of them were found in> the crash of the alien craft at Roswell and turned up in my files fourteen> years later.5 Corso’s Roswell scenario is thus the standard “recovered extraterrestrial craftand reverse engineering scenario” on steroids, for Corso provides throughout hisbook a list of specific technologies that he maintains owe their existence tothe Roswell Incident and the U.S. Army’s, and his, secret reverse engineeringproject. All the files from the Roswell Incident Corso maintains were stored inhis office in a single locked filing cabinet, a filing cabinet that containedsome of the actual debris.6 As will be seen in this chapter, Corso’s “list” ofsuch technologies poses certain problems for his “extraterrestrial” hypothesis,particularly in the light of some of his own statements about them.Colonel Corso also maintains that as a response to all the UFO activity in NewMexico in 1947 the army sent in teams of counter-intelligence agents throughoutthe state (and in fact around the country), to ascertain the level of Sovietespionage activities in response to the incidents.7 As a part of his scenario,he also states that various radar operators around the state noticed the UFOs ontheir radar screens, and mentions that one such operator, Steven Arnold, saw theradar blip explode “in a brilliant white fluorescence” and evaporate “rightbefore his very eyes.”8 Shades of Frank Kaufman! According to Corso at thatpoint the radar operators and counter-intelligence officers looked at each otherand thought the same thing: something had crashed, and as a result, the militarysprung into action and mobilized a search. “This was a national security issue —jump on anything and bring it back before anyone else could find it.”9Then Corso points his first subtle finger, not toward extraterrestrials, but toa more terrestrial origin:> Even before the radar officer called the 509th base commander, Col. William> Blanchard, reporting that radar indicated the crash of an unidentified> aircraft to the north and west of Roswell, the (counter-intelligence) dispatch> team had already mobilized to deploy an immediate response crash-and-retrieval> team to locate and secure the crash site. They believed this was an enemy> aircraft that had slipped through our radar defense system either from South> America or over the Canadian border and had taken photos of top-secret> military installations.10 If there is any truth to this claim — and with Corso one must always be morethan skeptical — then this is a significant observation, for Canada and LatinAmerica were both havens to postwar Nazi activity, as readers of my previousbooks already know, and Latin America in particular was the home of ongoingpostwar independent Nazi research into precisely the type of “field propulsionphysics” represented by “flying saucers.”11 More will be said about theseconnections in Part Three, but it was worth pointing out the basic significanceof Corso’s remarks here.And like many other Roswell witnesses, Corso also maintains that as part of thisrecovery operation, that some of the debris — and bodies — were shipped via landto Fort Riley, Kansas.12Finally, in what many be the ultimate context for the extraterrestrialinterpretation of the Roswell Incident, he also maintained that the real reasonfor the Cold War with the Soviet Union was the presence of the extraterrestrialfactor:> When you examine it, the record itself should have showed that another agenda> was present throughout the Cold War. After all, why did each side really have> ten or more times the number of warheads needed to completely’ destroy the> other side’s nuclear missile arsenal as well as their major population> centers? The real story behind the vast missile arsenals, the huge fleets of> bombers, and the ICBM submarine platforms that both sides deployed was the> threat to the aliens that if they occupied a portion of our planet, we had the> firepower to obliterate them. If they attacked the United States or the Soviet> Union so as to render one of the arsenals inoperable, we had enough missiles> to spare to make them pay so heavy a price for starting a war, it wasn’t even> worth trying.13 Consequently, “the Cold War, while real enough and dangerous enough, was also acover for us to develop a planetary tracking and defense system that looked intospace as well as into the Soviet’s backyard. And the Soviets were doing theexact same thing we were, looking up at the same time they were looking down.”14Whatever one thinks of Colonel Corso, or his book and its wild claims, this is arather intriguing notion, one that bears a little further analysis.Consider only the logical implications of these allegations in the light of hisprevious statements that the counter-intelligence teams that he alleges weredeployed to New Mexico, and in the light of their “first intuitive response”that whatever had crashed represented a terrestrial enemy, for when thesestatements are combined, they point to two rather frightening implications:> 1) That there is a terrestrially based “third force” or “power” that is> neither the United States nor the Soviet Union; and,> 2) It possesses a technology far in advance of either bloc, and that> technology has an off-world capability. And interestingly enough, Corso’s statements, when combined and analyzed in thisfashion, bear a resemblance to someone else’s statements.That person is Hitler’s former rocket expert, and one of the Nazi scientistsbrought to this country after the war under the then very secret ProjectPaperclip, Dr. Wernher Von Braun. According to one time close associate of VonBraun, Dr. Carol Rosin, Von Braun made a series of disclosures to her toward theend of his life, a series of disclosures now more or less well-known within theUFO community called “The Rosin Affidavit.” According to Dr. Rosin,> The strategy that Werner Von Braun taught me was that first the Russians are> going to be considered the enemy... Then terrorists would be identified, and> that was soon to follow... Then we were going to identify third-world country> “crazies.” We now call them Nations of Concern. But he said that would be the> third enemy against whom we would build space-based weapons. The next enemy> was asteroids. Now, at this point he kind of chuckled the first time he said> it. Asteroids — against asteroids we are going to build space-based weapons.> And the funniest one of all was what he called aliens, extraterrestrials.15 While Von Braun’s alleged statements seem to indicate that he viewed the wholeissue of extraterrestrials as a cover or deception, he oddly agrees with theimplications of Corso’s Cold War statements and its hidden agenda, namely, thatthere is a terrestrial power with access to some very sophisticated technology,and that it will be deployed in space. Just how sophisticated that technology ismay also be gleaned from Von Braun’s remarks, for a technology deployed “againstasteroids” would have to be either powerful enough to destroy one, or at leastmove it out of its course, if it were thought to be on a collision course withthe earth.1. CORSO’S EXTRATERRESTRIALS Corso’s descriptions of the extraterrestrials supposedly recovered from Roswellalso bear mentioning, for they depart little in their details from others’statements, save in his assertion that he was privy to the alleged medicalexaminer’s reports of the extraterrestrials. While we have already noted thatthe “alien autopsy film” was a complete hoax, it is worth taking note of whatCorso says about both the alleged extraterrestrials and about their craft, forwhile his Roswell Fantasia knows almost no limitations of imagination, some ofhis observations, once again, point subtle fingers to another origin, andanother agenda.He begins by noting that the Roswell “flying saucer” had no facilities eitherfor food preparation or waste disposal.16 and in the midst of a book about thesupposed crash and recovery of an extraterrestrial craft, this is an oddstatement to make. As Corso himself observes, this was one of the major problemsthat not only the Nazis were working on as a component of their nascent spaceprogram, but it is a major problem for any space program, extraterrestrial orterrestrial.17So again, Corso is perhaps being more subtle than either his defenders ordetractors may have noticed, for he has mentioned Nazis in connection with thefact that the Roswell craft had no food preparation or waste facilities, whichwould be commensurate with a craft designed for short range flights of shortduration.But Corso does talk about the supposedly recovered extraterrestrials, and infact, does so at great length and in great detail, so a word is necessary hereabout my methodology, in case it is not apparent to the reader. As has alreadybeen seen, most of the witnesses describing bodies in connection with theRoswell Incident have either been discredited or impeached. One need only recallKevin Randle’s words from his Roswell Revisited:> The best tales told about Roswell, those that brought in alien bodies in a> firsthand sense, have since been shown to be faked. Kaufmann, Anderson,> Dennis, and Ragsdale, who said they had seen the bodies (or in Dennis’s case,> a drawing of them), were later discovered to have invented their Roswell> connections.> Not only has this left a hole in the Roswell case, but it provides the> skeptics with the ammunition to sink the whole report. They can point to the> testimony of any of these men and say, “See, they were making it up and they> fooled you.”> The response will be that we who have investigated the Roswell case were the> ones to expose these reports for what they were. The skeptics stood on the> sidelines without having to get their hands dirty. So, yes, these men have> been exposed, but remember who did the work to expose them.18 At the time Corso and his co-author William Birnes were writing his book,however, that had not happened, and Corso — in what appears to me to have beenpure confabulation, relying on the then-sensational research of Roswell“revisionists” Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt — merely allowed him to give more orless free rein to his imagination, since he could claim to have had access tothe military’s secret reports, including its secret reports about the “deadextraterrestrials.” Thus, in citing Corso at this point, I am not ascribing anytruthfulness or lack thereof to his claims, I am merely drawing attention to yetanother interesting observation that he makes, notwithstanding his credibilityproblems.So, according to Corso, what were Corso’s intriguing observations about thealleged beings found on the Roswell craft? The first is interesting in and ofitself:> The very small mouths and the lack of a human digestive system troubled the> doctors at first because they didn’t know how these things were sustained. But> their first hypothesis that they processed chemicals released from their skin> and maybe even recirculated waste chemicals would have explained the lack of> any food-preparation or waste-processing facilities on the craft. I> speculated, however, that they didn’t require food or facilities for waste> disposal because they weren’t actual life-forms, only a kind of robot or> android....I kept thinking, also, that the skin analysis that I was reading> sounded more akin to the skin of a houseplant than the skin of a human being.> That, too, could have been another explanation for the lack of food or waste> facilities.19 There is the “big save,” the extraterrestrial “spin,” for now one was notdealing with real live “extraterrestrials,” but with their robotical,genetically engineered hybrids with plants!But a little earlier in the book, Corso dropped another radical conceptualbombshell, and this time, attributed it to General Twining: “General Twiningshowed photographs of these alien beings and autopsy reports that suggested theywere too human; they had to be related to our species in some way.”20 As weshall see in our analysis of the Majic-12 documents in Part Two, this idea findsan echo in them as well, and it could even be that Corso is relying on them forthis statement.Nonetheless, it is an interesting observation to make, for again, one of itslogical implications, regardless of whether there actually were any recoveredbodies, is that whatever the bodies were, they were the products not only of agenetic engineering, but moreover, they were “related to our species in someway,” namely, that one possibility is that they were from Earth and the productsof a terrestrial technology that involved human genetic makeup. Corso’s“extraterrestrials”, in other words, are our genetic “cousins.”Consequently Corso once again appears to be pointing a subtle finger, not in thedirection of outer space and extraterrestrials, but to planet Earth andengineered life-forms, and that finger is being pointed always within a contextthat obfuscates and confuses the reader: now is he pointing toextraterrestrials, now he is not.2. CORSO’S LIST OF RECOVERED EXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY This pattern of obfuscation only becomes more acute and apparent when oneexamines what Corso says in connection with the alleged recovered technology.For example, Corso maintains that much of the technology for President RonaldReagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative came from the Roswell Incident and therecovered craft, including “lasers, accelerated particle-beam weapons, andaircraft equipped with ‘Stealth’ features. And in the end, we not only outlastedthe Soviets and ended the Cold War, but we forced a stalemate with theextraterrestrials, who were not so invulnerable after all.”21 This is yetanother intriguing statement, for Corso is clearly implying that there has beensome sort of “covert war” going on “up there” between “us” and “them,” anobservation that, once again, he wishes his readers to place into theextraterrestrial context that he spins. But it could just as easily fit into theterrestrial context that he also has subtly indicated exists.22Corso like others also makes mention of “fiber optics-like” filaments,23integrated circuits,24 and, in the ultimate embellishment of the alien autopsyfilm, in which one can see a “doctor” removing a dark membrane from one of the“extraterrestrial’s” eyes, he mentions a kind of “infrared sight contactlens.”25 Nor is this all.There was a super-strong fiber cloth from which we obtained Kevlar,26 a kind of“headdress” or “visor” that interfaced directly between the brain of the“creatures” and the craft’s control mechanisms27 (implying thereby that the“creatures” were also some sort of cyborgs), even depleted uranium artilleryshells, hydrogen atom particle beam weapons,28 and even “irradiated food!”29 Andof course, there was the “memory metal.” Boiling all this down, Corso summarizesit all in a convenient list:> Image intensifiers, which ultimately became “night vision”> Fiber optics> Supertenacity fibers> Lasers> Molecular alignment metallic alloys> Integrated circuits and microminiaturization of logic boards> HARP (High Altitude Research Project)> Poject Horizon (moon base)30> Portable atomic generators (ion propulsion drive)> Irradiated Food> “Third Brain” guidance systems (EBE headbands)> Particle beams (“Star Wars” antimissile energy weapons)> Electromagnetic propulsion systems> Depleted uranium projectiles.31 All these things, Corso maintains, owe their existence to the Roswell Incident.As will be seen in a moment, there are those who object — strongly — to Corso’simplication that human intelligence cannot invent this on its own. And as weshall discover in Part Three, many of them have disturbing connections to theThird Reich.3. HOW THE CRAFT WORKED, ACCORDING TO CORSO There is one final detail in Corso’s Roswell Fantasia to be noted, and that ishow he maintains the craft actually travelled. According to Corso,> The craft was able to displace gravity through the propagation of magnetic> (waves), controlled by shifting the magnetic poles around the craft so as to> control, or vector, not a propulsion system but the repulsion force of like> charges. Once they realized this, engineers at our country’s primary defense> contractors raced among themselves to figure out how the craft could retain> its electric capacity and how the pilots who navigated it could live within> the energy field of a wave. At issue was not only a great discovery, but the> nuts-and-bolts chance to land multibillion-dollar development contracts for a> whole generation of military air and undersea craft. The initial revelations into the nature of the spacecraft and its pilotinterface came very quickly during the first few years of testing at Norton. Theair force (sic) discovered that the entire vehicle functioned just like a giantcapacitor. In other words, the craft itself stored the energy necessary topropagate the magnetic wave that elevated it, allowed it to achieve escapevelocity from the earth’s gravity, and enabled it to achieve speeds of over tenthousand miles per hour. The pilots weren’t affected by the tremendous g-forcesthat build up in the acceleration of conventional aircraft because to aliensinside, it was as if gravity was being folded around the outside of the wavethat enveloped the craft. Maybe it was like traveling inside the eye of ahurricane.32Again, there are a number of intriguing points here, not the least of which isthat, according to Corso, the craft was not exactly a typical “anti-gravity”craft, since it still apparently had to reach “escape velocity” to reach space.But there are three further implications to note about Corso’s remarks, and tomy knowledge, no one has noticed them:> 1) First, in order to “displace gravity through the propagation of magnetic> waves” and “fold gravity around the outside of the wave that enveloped the> craft,” one must of necessity posit the direct theoretical connection between> gravity and magnetism. This, of course, was in one sense what the various> “unified field theory” papers that were published in Germany between the two> World Wars were essentially trying to do;> 2) Another implication of Corso’s remarks is that there was apparently a kind> of “magnetic bubble” around the craft, as if it existed inside a kind of> “magnetic bottle;”> 3) Within this “bubble” or “bottle,” the magnetic polarity is apparently> shifting, or oscillating, constantly and, in order to vector repulsion of> charges, apparently rapidly; and finally,> 4) The military was apparently unable to figure out how any intelligent> creature could live in such an environment. For readers of my previous books, this should ring a Bell, for each of thesefour things were, in a direct way, involved in the Third Reich’s most highlyclassified secret weapons project from the war. For readers unfamiliar withthose books, we shall take these four points up again in Part Three.For now, however, it is necessary to point out something very significant aboutCorso’s remarks, for if one grants for the sake of argument the similarity ofhis descriptions with the basic principles operative in that secret Naziresearch project, then once again Corso is pointing an extraordinarily subtlefinger to Nazi Germany, and to its technological accomplishments. Moreover, heis doing so before there was any publication about that project in the Englishlanguage.33B. CORSO’S ASSERTIONS VERSUS THE PUBLIC HISTORIES OF THE TECHNOLOGIES Notwithstanding these intriguing and fascinating observations, Corso’sassertions about the extraterrestrial nature of the technologies on his listfell mostly on unsympathetic ears. For example, his assertion that the“headband” involved some sort of direct interface between the“extraterrestrials” and the craft itself have purely terrestrial antecedents.Since the 1970s there has been research in electro-encephalogram feedbacktechnology, sometimes utilizing electronic implants in the brain itself, for thethought-control of computers. But this research has an even longer terrestrialpedigree, not only to the mind-control projects of the notorious CIA MK-Ultraprogram, but also to the “psychotronic” research of psychologist Dr. JoseDelGado, research that goes back to the 1950s and, if one factors the Nazis intothe mind-control research mix, even farther.As for night vision-enhancement technology, this, as will be seen in Part Three,is definitely a technology with not only a Nazi provenance from the Second WorldWar, but an American one as well, and at least in America’s case, that researchcontinued at Fort Belvoir after the war, and received an impetus in the 1960sfrom the image intensification research of William Spicer.Integrated circuits have a well-known terrestrial pedigree as well, since theidea of imprinting electrical micro-circuits on chips was the brainchild of TedHoff, who began the first research in 1968, and who does not recall any contactwith anyone in the military having suggested the idea to him. In any case, manycritics of Corso’s claims have also pointed out that such a technology wouldalso require the invention of scanning electron microscopes in order to analyzeany such chips, an invention whose public pedigree, at least, stems from 1966.34As for Corso’s assertions about lasers, their public history begins at HughesAircraft in the early 1950s, with physicist Charles Townes working out the firstconcepts, which resulted first in a microwave laser, or maser as they are known,and the first optical laser in 1960.Fiber optics have a similar connection tovery terrestrial technology and thinkers. In fact, the inventor of thetelephone, Alexander Graham Bell, patented an invention which he regarded as farmore significant than the telephone, a device he called the “photophone,” whichtransmitted voice signals on light, and that in the nineteenth century! Theproblem with Bell’s photophone — which was solved by fiber optics — was that onecould not bend those signals around corners. Fiber optics represent a blendingof technologies, namely, the laser, and the ability to make a fused, pliablesilica filament, which was accomplished by a trio of researchers at CorningIndustries: Don Keele, Peter Schultz, and Bob Mauer. The advantage of thisfilament was that it could handle some 65,000 times more information per unitvolume than standard wires.And finally, the superstrong fibers of Kevlar and similar materials owe theirexistence not to extraterrestrials crashing things into the earth, but to aresearcher at Du Point in the 1960s.C. CORSO’S “TECHNOLOGIES LIST” AND THE NAZI CONNECTION Like other things in his book, Corso’s claim that much of this technology has a“hidden history” is itself obfuscated, for he also points the finger not onlysubtly, as in the examples seen previously, but very openly toward a veryterrestrial, and a very sinister, origin: Nazi Germany.In fact, according to Corso, the military’s first suspicions fell upon theSoviet Union, and to the possibility that the craft represented a secret Russianproject based on Nazi designs “because it bore such a resemblance to some of theGerman-designed aircraft that had made their appearances near the end of thewar, especially the crescent-shaped Horton (sic) flying wing.”35 But, to quoteCorso himself, “that’s not even the whole story:”> In those confusing hours after the discovery of the crashed Roswell alien> craft, the army determined that in the absence of any other information it had> to be an extraterrestrial. Worse, the fact that this craft and other flying> saucers had been surveilling our defensive installations and even seemed to> evidence a technology we’d seen evidenced by the Nazis caused the military to> assume these flying saucers had hostile intentions and might have even> interfered in human events during the war.36 Here, Corso has managed to pack his obfuscation all into two sentences, andwithin the same immediate context at that, and has not spread it out all overthe whole book, for on the one hand, he implies that “in the absence of otherinformation” the military had concluded it was extraterrestrial, yet, in thevery next sentence, he points a not-too-subtle and openly self-contradictoryfinger to the Nazi resemblance of the Roswell technology!Apparently this “Nazi resemblance” was so palpable that Corso, when heestablished the secret team he needed to “reverse engineer” and “seed” all thisrecovered “extraterrestrial” technology into American industry, that he went tohis superior officer, General Trudeau, and asked him if he could bring Nazi“scientists with clearance who(sic) we can trust, Oberth and von Braun” into theproject “for advice.”37 Well might Corso turn to “Nazis whom we can trust,” foras a former participant in Operation Paperclip — the secret project designed tobring former Nazi scientists to work in this country after the war — he wasfollowing a pattern that, as will be seen in Part Three, allowed the Armysimultaneously to brand someone “an ardent Nazi” but in the ultimate obfuscationto assert that they posed to security threat to the national security interestsof the United States of America!A final “Nazi whom we can trust,” to whom Corso turned for “advice” in hisalleged secret reverse-engineering group was none other than Hans Kohler,38inventor of odd little coil between the world wars that contained nothing butmagnets in a hexagonal pattern, around which were wound coils in an unusualcircuit. This coil contained no power source, and yet, was able to transduceenergy, i.e., to produce an electrical current, apparently “from nowhere” andjust by the odd configuration of the magnets and coils.image [images/00029.jpg] Schematic of the Kohler Coil I have written previously about this coil in two of my books, and we shallencounter it again in Part Three. For the moment, however, all that need benoted is that once again Colonel Corso is pointing a finger not only in NaziGermany’s direction, but toward specific technologies and devices nevermentioned by the rest of the Roswell community, devices and technologies,moreover, that can only be considered hyper-dimensional, and based on principlesof physics radically different than that of classical electrodynamics. 39And yet, amid all this, once again Corso obfuscates, this time by pushing his“recovered and reverse engineered extraterrestrial craft” scenario further backinto history, not to Roswell, but to Nazi Germany itself:> At the very least, Twining had suggested, the crescent-shaped craft looked so> uncomfortably like the German Horten wings our flyers had seen at the end of> the war that he had to suspect the Germans had bumped into something we didn’t> know about. And his conversations with Wernher von Braun and Willy Ley in the> days after the crash confirmed this. They didn’t want to be thought of as> verrűkt (crazy, ed.) but intimated that there was a deeper story about what> the Germans had engineered. No, the similarity between the Horten wing and the> craft they had pulled out of the arroyo was no accident. We always wondered> how the Germans were able to incorporate such advanced technology into their> weapons development in so short a time and during the Great Depression. Did> they have help? Maybe we were now as lucky as the Germans and broke off a> piece of this technology for ourselves.40 In other words, Nazi technology was itself a product of a similarreverse-engineering project.While it is extremely unlikely that any Allied or Soviet pilot ever saw any ofthe Horten wings in actual flight during combat circumstances as these aircraftwere highly classified, and only flown when the Allies or Soviets were notaround, what is of real interest here is Corso’s mention of the German rocketscientist Willy Ley, who, unlike Wernher Von Braun, was not one of thescientists brought to this country under Operation Paperclip. Ley had emigratedto the United States of America prior to the war because of his disagreementwith the Nazi government.More importantly, Ley was the scientist who mentioned that a German secretsociety, the Vril society, was investigating the physical properties of thespace-time medium itself. The Vril society in turn is alleged to have been theorganization behind an attempt to contact “extraterrestrials” via psychicmediums and “channeling.” During one such attempt after the First World War,held ironically near Berchtesgaden, the medium Maria Orsic is alleged to havemade contact with a civilization in the Aldebaran Star system, and as a result,was able to channel the plans for an advanced hyper-dimensional craft.41The problem with the whole “extraterrestrial contact” in Nazi Germany istwofold. Firstly, those maintaining that this contact occurred are Neo-Nazis,and they have yet to produce one scintilla of evidence in support of theirassertions. Secondly, there are those who allege that Nazi Germany experiencedits own “Roswell event” and recovered and began to reverse engineer thetechnology. The dates and places for this recovery range from the Black Forestin 1936, to the Harz Mountains region of Thuringia in central Germany in 1933.But again, never has any proof or witness come forward, and there is no hint ofsuch an event in the voluminous archives of the Third Reich that have beendeclassified.42In the end, Corso’s claims were simply too incredible for the more scrupulousRoswell researchers, whether believers or skeptics, to be believed, and in themain, this author concurs with their assessments both of the man and his book.However, let it never be forgotten for a moment that Corso was an intelligenceofficer. As such, the possibility must be entertained that his book — far frombeing merely a Walter Mitty fantasia or an attempt to turn a quick and easyprofit — may have been a deliberate disinformation exercise, designed both toreveal, and conceal, information, and to misdirect attention and plant the seedsof misinterpretation.In that light, it is perhaps significant that Corso has provided both blatantand much more subtle clues that clearly point to a possible Nazi aspect to theRoswell Incident, and planted them in such a way that in each and every mentionwithin his book of a possible Nazi root or resemblance of the Roswelltechnologies, the inevitable “extraterrestrial obfuscation” intrudes to imposethe misdirection. But in the final analysis, with close and careful reading itcould be said that the late Colonel Corso would bid us to look across theAtlantic Ocean, as much as he would bid us to look up to the heavens, for theanswer to the Roswell Incident.As we shall now see, he was not the only careful obfuscator bidding us to doso...image [images/00003.jpg] 1 “ RAAF Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch in Roswell Region: No Details of FlyingDisk are Revealed: Roswell Hardware Man and Wife Report Disk Seen,” RoswellDaily Record, July 8, 1947.2 Berlitz and Moore, The Roswell Incident, pp. 28-29, emphasis added.3 Col.

Witkowski had published his Bellproject research in Poland prior to that, so it is possible that Corso, with hisintelligence connections, might have heard about it and have been able to obtainan English translation from those Polish language books from them.

Randle1 Stanton T. Friedman is rightly regarded as the “father of modern ufology,” forunlike many ufologists, Friedman brings to the subject a trained scientificintellect, a penetrating analytical mind, and the discipline and determinationto ferret out the most minute of documentary details. All these he brings tobear in a signally important book analyzing the case for the authenticity ofsome of the so-called Majic-12 or Majestic-12 documents: Top Secret/Majic:operation Majestic-12 and the United States Government’s UFO Cover-up.But for those who may not know the story of this fascinating set of allegedlyleaked and highly classified U.S. government UFO documents, a brief review is inorder.In December 1984 the first of the Majic-12 documents arrived at the home ofufologist Jamie Shandera. Or rather, what arrived at Shandera’s home was adouble-wrapped “plain brown envelope with no return address and an Albuquerque,New Mexico postmark.”2 Inside the envelope was a roll of undevelopedblack-and-white 35mm film. But why would some anonymous “documents leaker” sendthis film to Shandera.Friedman suggests that it was because at that time Shandera was cooperating withhim and fellow-Roswell researcher Bill Moore, and that Shandera, who haddeveloped several “inside” contacts with the Air Force Office of SpecialInvestigations (OSI, or AFOSI), was a logical choice for someone to leakdocuments to.3Once it was developed, the film proved to be nothing less than explosive, forwhat it showed were simple photographs of a top secret briefing documentallegedly prepared by the Truman Administration for incoming President-ElectDwight D. Eisenhower. According to the document, Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetterwas Eisenhower’s briefing officer. Leaving aside the details contained in thedocument for a little later in this chapter, the document outlines the crash andrecovery of a flying saucer, its occupants, its technology, and theestablishment of a super-secret research and development committee knownalternatively as Majic-12 or Majestic-12 which was directly responsible to thePresident. Additionally, the document lists the twelve members of thatcommittee, plus eight annexes or appendices to the document, only the first ofwhich was actually contained on the film mailed to Shandera.Two more documents were later leaked to ufologists, and together, these thedocuments we will simply refer to as the “Original Set” of Majic-12 documents,to distinguish them from a much vaster collection allegedly leaked over time toTimothy Cooper, about which more in a moment. The circumstances surrounding thearrival of these two other documents were as bizarre — if not more so — thanthose by which the Eisenhower Briefing Document arrived at Jamie Shandera’shome.While Friedman, Moore, and Shandera were conducting their invertigations of theEisenhower Briefing Document and trying to authenticate it or prove it to be ahoax, Moore and Shandera began receiving mysterious postcards containing riddleson them:> The return address on one was “Box 189, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,” and it was> postmarked New Zealand. Considering that Jaimie and Bill were in contact with> government insiders, we knew it was easy enough for someone to put a postcard> in an envelope, send it overseas, and have someone else mail the postcard back> here. Moore read one of the cards to me over the phone, and we tried to puzzle> it out. It mentioned Reese’s Pieces and also Suitland, a repository for> government files — and a sort of annex of the National Archives — that I had> visited... We decided that it would be a good idea for somebody to go to> Washington.4 The task of going to “Suitland” in Washington, D.C. fell to Moore and Shandera,who spent several days at the archives examining boxes and files. Then, Shanderamade another astonishing discovery:> While putting one file folder back in a box and pulling out the next file,> Jaimie discovered a piece of paper between the files: the July 14, 1954 memo> from Robert Cutler to General Twining. The box in which Jaimie found this> document? Box 189.> The memo is a carbon copy in blue ink on onionskin paper. The message is> straighforward and simple.... It refers to an NSC/MJ-12 Special Studies> Project briefing. The paper is old, and has a watermark. There is aging around> the edge of the paper. There is a slanted red pencil mark the unusual security> marking in the upper right corner. The text doesn’t provide a clue as to the> subject matter of the project — it is clearly a simple administrative notice> that a briefing will take place during an already scheduled meeting rather> than after, as originally planned.... There is no signature on the memo, nor> even an /s/ next to Cutler’s name indicating that he had signed the original.5 Robert Cutler was the Special Asisistant for National Security to PresidentEisenhower, and General Twining was, of course, the commanding officer of theAir Force’s Air Materiel Command during the time of the Roswell Incident.The other document that was leaked to ufologists was what Friedman calls“perhaps the mother of all majestic-12 documents!”6 In March of 1994 well-knownufologist Don Berliner and Friedman’s co-author of Crash at Corona received adocument in the mail, in the same manner as had Shandera ten years earlier, in amanilla envelope with a roll of film.> The roll of 35mm film had been mailed from Wisconsin, but without a return> address. At first, Don thought nothing of the matter, since he had recently> come back from the huge Experimental Aircraft Show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin,> where he had shot many rolls of film. He presumed that he had left a roll of> film behind and someone from the show had sent it to him.> Only when he had the film developed did he realize that he had black-and-white> pictures of a document, not of aircraft. The first frame was the cover page of> a report entitled Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual:> Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal. It was marked> TOP SECRET/MAJIC Eyes Only, and was dated April 1954. The report outlined how> to secure, package, ship, and store artifacts and extraterrestrial biological> entities from recovered alien flying saucers! The contents page indicated that> the original manual contained six chapters, four appendices, 30 pages of text,> and a section of photographs. Unfortunately, not all of the pages of the> manual had been photographed.7 Needless to say, this document, if genuine, was a veritable smoking gun, if notfor the extraterrestrial interpretation of the Roswell Incident, then at leastfor the existence of a super-secret government program and unit tasked with theretrieval of crashed extraterrestrial technologies and entities. Additionally,notwithstanding that there is no explicit mention of the Roswell Incident in thedocument as currently extant, it nevertheless provided a general corroborativecontext to the extraterrestrial interpretation of that Incident.Of course, it was not long before skeptics accused Friedman and his associatesof forging and then “leaking” the documents to themselves, but theseaccusations, as we shall shortly see, Friedman ably and effectively dispatched.These documents — the Eisenhower Briefing Document, the Cutler-Twining Memo, andthe Special Operations Manual — constitute the “Original Set” of Majic-12documentsBut there is another set of documents also purporting to be Majic-12 documents,and these as we shall see are much more problematical not only with respect tohow they were leaked, but with respect to what many of them contained. These arethe so-called “Cooper-Cantwheel” set of documents, and this set, rather thanconstituting a trickle of leaks, was a veritable flood. And that “flood” indeedconstitutes one of their principal problems.Beginning in late 1992, three new alleged Majic-12 documents were sent toufologist and Roswell researcher Tim Cooper of California.> Tim had become interested in Roswell and MJ-12, and tried to learn as much as> he could about crashed saucers in New Mexico. He had been talking to a number> of retired military personnel who were living near him and who had been> heavily involved in highly classified matters back in the 1940s. His own> father, while running the printing department at Alamogordo Army Air Field,> had apparently been asked to print a long, highly classified document dealing> with at least one crashed saucer and alien bodies. His father always refused> to gvie many details. We had a number of telephone conversations, and Tim> eventually passed on copies of the documents he had received.8 Originally Cooper was reluctant to pass on the first document because it was“extremely poorly reproduced, and Tim was initially reluctant to pass it on forfear he would be accused of forging it.”9 Nonetheless he eventually shared acopy with Friedman.This proved to be a memorandum from Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, and was a“Memorandum for the President,” with security markings that read “TOPSECRET/MAJIC ETES ONLY” at the bottom. The memorandum states that Hillenkoetterhad all the information summaries gleaned from “the machines” summarized andbound into a “Black Book both for convenience...and for greater (security) inhandling,” and goes on to state that Hillenkoetter was sending two of thebooklets to the President for him to “glance through in order to familiarizeyourself with the manner in which the information is presented.” The memorandumends with Hillenkoetter stating that he will send the books to the White Houseeach week.10Somewhat later, Cooper sent Friedman two more documents. One was a memorandumfrom General George C. Marshal to President Truman. The memo states that GeneralTwining would be presenting a “report” to the President that day, and statesthat they should “treat Twining’s report (as) top secret and that no indicationof its content be divulged to the public.”11The final document was “a Top Secret Eyes Only directive to General Twining.This memo had no typed-in date, but at the bottom was a scrawled ‘Approved HarryTruman July 9, 1947.’12 This document directed General Twining to go to theWhite Sands Proving Ground Command Center “without delay for the purpose ofmaking an appraisal of the reported unidentified objects being kept there,” andthat Twining was to to take with him “such experts, technicians, scientists andassistants as you deem necessary to the effectiveness of your mission.”13But as the documents swelled from a trickle to a stream and finally a flood,document examiners Drs. Robert and Ryan Wood disclosed another interestingdetail. Unlike the anonymous posting of rolls of film to Shandera and Berliner,or even the strange postcards with their Addis Ababa return address and NewZealand postmarks, the Woods disclosed that Cooper claimed to be receiving thedocuments from a man calling himself “Thomas Cantwheel,” and that they came inenvelopes with an Albuquerque, New Mexico postmark.14A. FRIEDMAN ON THE NATURE OF MAJIC-12 DOCUMENT AUTHENTICITY1. THE METHODOLOGY There is a problem, however, in authenticating such documents, and the carefulreader will have immediately spotted it: all the documents came on film or, withthe exception of the Cutler-Twining Memo, the Cooper-Cantwheel series ofdocuments were photocopies. Consequently, all documents lack any provenance thatcould determine their authenticity or lack thereof. Furthermore, there was noway to test the originals for the paper that they were written on, nor for theinks used in signatures.15 Only the Cutler-Twining Memo contained a crucialdetail that allowed Freidman and his colleagues to verify its probableauthenticity.Even with access to the original documents, there is another possibility thatFriedman and fellow Majic-12 researchers must contend with:> ...Even the best expert cannot guarantee absolutely that any document is> genuine, for a clever forger or disinformation specialist — especially one> within the intelligence community — would have access to all the appropriate> ink, paper, typewriters, signature samples, and memo formats.> In an area as controversial as ufology, the possibility of fraud or> disinformation is everpresent.16 As far as the Eisenhower Briefing Document — the very first leaked Majic-12document — was concerned, there were three possibilities, as Friedman saw them.First, it could be an outright hoax: “Were these mysterious documents intendedto fool us into going public so that these debunkers could say ‘Gotcha!’ anddiscredit not only us but the entire Roswell story as well?”17 But a plain andsimple hoax was unlikely, since whoever sent the documents to Shandera wouldhave known that he, Moore, and Friedman would spare no effort to authenticatethe documents.That brought up a second, and more likely possibility, namely that the documentscould be some sort of disinformation that contained “some truth mixed with somephony material, sending researchers off on a wild-goose chase and keeping thesecrets for that much longer. Perhaps there was a Majestic-12 group, but itdealt with something entirely different.”18 As will be discovered in Part Three,the Nazi scenario can offer an alternative explanation for the presence of suchdocuments and the formation of such a group, and offers a plausible explanationfor why such documents might be considered disinformation.But the final possibility was that they were “plain straight legitimate.”19Under such circumstances — lacking the original documents by which to comparepapers, inks, signatures and so on — there was really only one method by whichto argue for or against their authenticity, and that was to argue from theinternal evidence itself. That is, did the documents adhere to establishedprotocols for dating and for government memoranda at that time period? Moreimportantly, was the specific information presented in them credible? Did thealleged people involved in the Majic-12 Group make rational sense?It is especially with respect to the last question that Friedman’s analysisshines, for as will be seen, each of the individuals named as a member of theMajic-12 Group makes eminent sense, and, in the case of one of them, makesspecial sense in the light of the Nazi Scenario, but, as I will argue, not muchsense in the light of the extraterrestrial one. Indeed, as we proceed with ourexamination of the Majic-12 documents problem in this part of the book, we willdiscover that — whether legitimate or a hoax — someone seems to be taking painsto point very subtle fingers and plant very subtle clues to “look to the Nazis.”2. THE EISENHOWER BRIEFING DOCUMENT There is no doubt, given the actual contents of the Eisenhower Briefing Document— if authentic — that its contents made it “one of the most important classifiedgovernment documents ever leaked to the public.”20 So first, a look at theimportant pages of the document are in order. I will present actual pictures ofthe document, the present the actual text for ease of reading, beforesummarizing Friedman’s analysis and argumentation for its authenticity.image [images/00030.jpg] Eisenhower Briefing Document, Page 1 Title Page image [images/00031.jpg] Eisenhower Briefing Document, Page 2 image [images/00032.jpg] Eisenhower Briefing Document, Page 3 image [images/00033.jpg] Eisenhower Briefing Document, Page 4 image [images/00034.jpg] Eisenhower Briefing Document, Page 5 image [images/00035.jpg] Eisenhower Briefing Document, Page 6 image [images/00036.jpg] Eisenhower Briefing Document, Truman-Forrestal Memorandum And now the actual text of the document:image [images/00037.jpg] image [images/00038.jpg] image [images/00039.jpg] image [images/00040.jpg] image [images/00041.jpg] image [images/00042.jpg] image [images/00043.jpg] 3. THE MAJETIC-12 MEMBERSHIP LISTA. DR. DONALD MENZEL The document presents the following internal information that can be used toverify the document’s authenticity:> 1) The security classification markings “Top Secret/Eyes Only” and “Top> Secret/Majic/Eyes Only.” Neither classification is all that unusual so from> this standpoint, the document appears authentic, though the classification> “Top Secret/Majic/Eyes Only” is the point in question, i.e., is there a> Majic-12 or Majestic-12 Group. However, from the point of internal consistency> and the document’s own statement that the contents it contains involves> compartmentalized information, such a classification or similar scheme would> be expected.> 2) The document refers to twelve alleged members of the study group, and this> therefore constitutes a major area of verification: do these members make> sense in the context of a top secret study group established to analyze the> Roswell Incident and the alleged recovery of technologies and extraterrestrial> bodies?> 3) The document contains obvious formatting such as dating formats and other> internal references that can also be used as points for verification or denial> of authenticity.> 4) Finally, the document contains internal information which both supports the> extraterrestrial interpretation of the Roswell Incident, and which — in spite> of being ignored by the ufology community — suggests another interpretation as> well. Of these four areas of potential verification, obviously the most specific andimportant are its list of the alleged members of the Majestic-12 study group,and these Friedman rightly and astutely zeros in on in his effort to verify thedocument.And of these twelve, the one that most stood out to Friedman, and rightly so, asbeing the most unusual and unlikely member of such a group was the famousHarvard astronomer, Dr. Donald Menzel. The reason that Dr. Menzel was such anunlikely candidate for membership in such a group was that he was well-knownthroughout the late 1950s and 1960s as one of the major UFO-debunkers, havingauthored some books on the subject that attempted to explain away all suchsightings and incidents along entirely naturalist and “scientific” man-madelines. Menzel concocted a variety of pseudo-scientific explanations for thephenomena ranging from “cloud reflections” to other equally creativeexplanations that remind one of Dr. J. Allen Hynek’s infamous “swamp gas”theory.21 Indeed, one can sense Friedman’s own perplexity at the presence ofMenzel’s name on the Majestic-12 list:> (Why) would a Harvard professor of astronomy, hardly a high-security-level> position, be working with the other people on the Majestic-12 list? These> included the first four directors of the CIA (or its forerunner), the first> Secretary of Defense, and Vannevar Bush, who headed the wartime Office of> Scientific Research and Development and was in charge of the Manhattan Project> and other high-security military research projects.22 Not only that, when Dr. Menzel was being reviewed for an Air Force securityclearance of merely “Secret” level, he actually had to appear before hearings,since he had been “fingered” as potentially disloyal during those days when theMcCarthyite era was just beginning to gather momentum. Indeed, none other thanDr. Vannevar Bush, President Franklin Roosevelt’s “science tsar” testified inbehalf of his friend Menzel. This made it even more curious, for how could suchan individual gain the much-higher security clearance needed for something likeMajestic-12?23Visiting the Harvard University archives to access Dr. Menzel’s papers, Friedmanmade an astonishing discovery about the famous late astronomer:> (I) decided to make a stab in the dark and start with Menzel’s correspondence> with President Kennedy. Frankly, I was curious as to why there even was such a> file. (It turns out that Kennedy was on the Board of Overseers at Harvard, had> chosen astronomy as his special interest area, and was well-acquainted with> Menzel.) To my surprise, the correspondence showed that Menzel led two> separate lives.> Publicly, Menzel was a famous astronomy professor serving on international> committees, leading solar eclipse expeditions, establishing solar> observatories, supervising graduate students, and debunking UFOs.> Privately, he did highly classified consulting work for federal intelligence> agencies, primarily with the huge National Security Agency (NAS), and for more> than thirty corporations on such matters as radio wave propagation,> cryptography, and apparently, alien interstellar spacecraft.> ....> Two quotes form letters to Kennedy (there are many others) show Menzel’s> intelligence involvement and discretion. Speaking of the NSA and its> predecessor U.S. Navy agency in an August 13, 1960 letter, he said, “I have> been associated with this activity for almost 30 years and probably have the> longest continuous record of association of any person in the country.

Obviously in an unclassified letter, I cannot go further into detail..”> So Menzel did belong with the other high-security-level members of> Majestic-12!24 Friedman also discovered that Menzel’s association and friendship with Dr.Vannavar Bush went back to 1934,25 that he also held a Navy Top Secret UltraSecurity Clearance at the very time the “Air Force was trying to withdraw hismuch lower-level Secret clearance,”26 and that he was known for his great careand discretion with respect to classified matters.27 Additionally, “he was wellacquainted with Detlev Bronk and Lloyd Berkner, other members of MJ-12, as wellas most of the other top scientists of the 1950s.”28Finally, Menzel had even learned Japanese as part of his cryptography work. Butat this juncture, Friedman makes a telling observation: “He was an ideal personto analyze the symbols on the Roswell crash debris, since he had the high-levelsecurity clearance to go with his cryptographic skills and understanding of anentirely different — ‘alien’ — symbolic language.”29 This, however, raises a fewproblems.As we saw in the first two chapters of this book, witnesses to the Roswelldebris sometimes described the writing on some of it as appearing to look likeChinese or Japanese writing. While Menzel would certainly be in a position todecipher Japanese writing, for if it was such writing, it does not bode well foran extraterrestrial interpretation of the Roswell Incident. And even if it wasnot, there is no reason to assume that the writing represented a linguistic formof communication to begin with; it could very well have been some other type ofcommunication or symbolism, and the assumption that it was such linguisticcommunication may have been one of the reasons — according to the internalindications of the Eisenhower Briefing Document itself — that it was notdeciphered.But howsoever one slices it, Friedman has, in this author’s opinion,demonstrated Menzel’s mention on the Majestic-12 list in the Eisenhower BriefingDocument makes very rational sense in a certain way, for who better to involvein such a group than a famous astronomer, a known UFO debunker — useful forputting out “spin” — and a capable cryptographer? While Friedman admits that “myresearch has not revealed a ‘smoking gun’ pointing to Menzel’s involvement inOperation Majestic-12,” he nonetheless has successfully demonstrated that thefamous Harvard professor lived a double-life, and that he had> the right kind of specialized theoretical and technical knowledge; he had> written fiction and non-fiction for popular consumption; he had the right> security clearances; he maintained a long and patriotic involvement with> highly classified work; he had a close association with the other top-level> people listed as being involved in Majestic-12.30 This, as Friedman aptly observes, is an argument not for the Eisenhower BriefingDocument’s non-authentic nature, but on the contrary, a very strong argumentfrom the internal evidence as to its probable origin from someone inside thegovernment and close to the project itself, for if the document was “fraudulentor intentionally misleading, they were put together by somebody on the insidewho knew that Menzel would pass muster. None one the outside knew that.”31 WhileFriedman clearly and strongly advocates in favor of the Briefing Document’s pureauthenticity, this comment should not be overlooked, for he is leaving the dooropen — just a sliver — for the possibility that it might have been designed asdisinformation. That possibility will be examined in a moment.B. THE OTHERS But what of the other members of the list in the document? Can a similarrationalization for their presence be found? As Friedman notes, the membershiplist of the Eisenhower Briefing Document lists twelve men, six civilians, andsix others being military members, with two members drawn from each of the threeservice branches.32General Nathan Twining was, of course, an obvious choice, since as thecommanding general of the Air Force’s Air Materiel Command any analysis ofrecovered flying saucer debris would likely be handled by his command.Additionally, Friedman observes that “Alamogordo was the home to a contingent ofTwining’s Air Materiel Command scientists and numerous rocket scientists,including the German contingent under Werner von Braun.”33 Thus, there is a slimpossibility that any analysis of such recovered wreckage might indeed, asColonel Corso suggested, have included some of the Nazi Paperclip scientists.As for Dr. Vannevar Bush, he too is another logical choice for membership in theMajestic-12 Group. As Friedman notes, he had headed the Office of ScientificResearch and Development during the Second World War, and then “the group out ofwhich the (Atomic Energy Commission) was formed.” He was also “the prewarchairman of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA),” theprecursor from World War Two of what would eventually become the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).34General Doolittle also makes sense, since he was “one of the first recipients ofa Ph.D. in aeronautics (from MIT when (Vannevar) Bush was dean.)”35 Dr. JeromeHunsacker also makes sense, since he succeeded Dr. Vannevar Bush as the chairmanof NACA and had also been involved in various intelligence activities.36 Dr.Lloyd Berkner was another logical choice given his association with Brookhaven,and was in fact also a member of the CIA’s Robertson UFO panel established by“then-CIA director Walter Bedell Smith in early 1953 to evaluate UFOs.”37Likewise Gordon Gray’s membership in the Majestic-12 Group could be similarlyrationalized, for he had been in a top oversight position of the Manhattan atombomb Project during the world war, and had intelligence experience whichincluded being the Special Assistant to the President for National SecurityAffairs, “in effect the liaison between the president and the (National SecurityCouncil),” and was also “a member of the President’s Foreign intelligenceAdvisory Board.”38 Certainly someone with black projects experience, and withexperience in handling foreign intelligence and diplomacy, would be an idealmember of such a group as Majestic-12. General Hoyt S. Vandenberg was by thetime of the Eisenhower Briefing Document the Air Force Chief of Staff. AdmiralRoscoe Hillenkoetter, General Walter Bedell Smith and Admiral Sidney Souers hadall been directors of the Central Intelligence Agency, or in Souers’ case, itspredecessor, the Central Intelligence Group, and Bedell Smith had of course alsobeen Eisenhower’s chief of staff during the Second World War.39 And JamesForrestal was, of course, the Secretary of Defense, so again, his presence iseminently logical.There are two other connections that Friedman mentions, and these are that Dr.Detlev Bronk, a principal scientist in the development of the field ofbiophysics, was also a former president of Rockefeller University in New YorkCity.40 He shared this Rockefeller connection with fellow Majestic-12 memberVannevar Bush who was also a member of the 1953 Rockefeller Commission.41 Thepossible significance of this Rockefeller connection in the context of the Naziscenario will be explored more fully in Part Three.C. THE MISSING ANNEXES AND THE TRUMAN-FORRESTAL MEMORANDUM When the Eisenhower Briefing Document arrived in Shandera’s mail, the filmshowed only the first eight pages, including only the first of its eight annexesor “attachments.”> Obviously, it would have been wonderful to have related documents that would> verify the information in the briefing. For example, it would be very useful> to have attachments B through H of the briefing document, which from the> content page received would include details of the alien bodies, the materials> and structures, names of investigators, and so on. Since MJ-12 appears to have> been an ongoing project, documents from before and after the briefing would be> important, too.42 But Friedman was able to verify something very significant about Attachment “A”,the Truman-Forrestal Memorandum. Writing the Truman Library about the document,Friedman learned that the Library was able to confirm that there had indeed beena meeting between President Truman, Secretary of Defense Forrestal, and Dr.Vannevar Bush precisely on the date of the Attachment in the Eisenhower BriefingDocument: September 24, 1947.434. THE CUTLER-TWINING MEMO As was seen previously, the Cutler-Twining Memo emerged under curiouscircumstances, being discovered by Jaimie Shandera sandwiched between folders inBox 189 at the National Archives. It consisted of a carbon copy of a typedmemorandum from Robert Cutler to General Nathan Twining on onion-skin paper witha watermark. The memo read as follows:> MEMORANDUM FOR GENERAL TWINING> SUBJECT: NSC/MJ-12 Special Studies Project> The President has decided that the MJ-12 SSP briefing should take place during> the already scheduled White House meeting of July 16, rather than following it> as previously intended. More precise arrangements will be explained to you> upon arrival. Please alter your plans accordingly.> Your concurrence in the above change of arrangements is assumed. > ROBERT CUTLER> Special Assistant> to the President44 According to Friedman, “there is no signature on the memo, nor even an /s/ nextto Cutler’s name indicating that he had signed the original.”45 This presented aproblem for the verification of the memorandum.Fortunately, however, both Bill Moore and Jaimie Shandera, who had seen theoriginal memorandum in the National Archives, were able to hold the memorandumup to the light and see the watermark on the paper. The paper itself wasmanufactured by a stationer named Fox Paper in Wisconsin. Bill Moore thencontacted Fox paper and spoke to the company’s watermark expert, who informedhim that the stationary> was made only in bid lots between 1953 and the early 1970s. The government> bought a great deal of the paper, and the bid lot limitation meant that it> wouldn’t show up in retail stores all over the country — only major customers> such as the government would buy it. So we know that the paper fits the time> scheme, it would have been available in a number of government offices, and it> would generally not have been available to the public.> Besides the paper checking out, the language, style, format, and typeface of> the memo appear to be genuine, especially when compared to other memos from> Cutler that are known to be valid.46 Indeed, the fact that the watermarked onion-skin paper was sold only in bid lotsand that the government was a major purchaser of the lots strongly establishesthe likely authenticity of the document.And that in turn argues strongly that the “MJ-12 Special Studies Project” didindeed exist, and that General Twining was a member of it.475. THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS MANUAL The final component in the “Original Set” of Majic-12 documents was the SpecialOperations Manual that Don Berliner received on a roll of black-and-white filmin March of 1994. Once again, there was internal evidence to support thedocument’s authenticity. For example, rather than use the term “UFOs” thedocument referred to “UFOBs” which stood for “unidentified flying objects,” andwas a term that had brief currency precisely during the mid-1950s.48Friedman with Berliner’s permission then shared a copy with Dr. Robert Wood,> who had recently retired after more than 40 years as a scientist and project> manager for McDonnell Douglas in California. Bob had a high-level professional> interest in UFOs and advanced technology dating back to the 1960s and had> given lectures on UFOs to several organizations. He is one of a handful of> professional people interested in UFOs whom I trust completely: excellent> technical background, sound judgment, very knowledgeable about UFOs and high> security. I hoped that Bob, because of past efforts on high-security programs,> could check on the appropriateness of the security warning and other> markings(on the Special Operations Manual). We discussed the document at> length.> Bob then did something truly special. Using his computer, he matched the> typefaces in the manual and tried to read every portion of the available> pages.49 Don had better 8” x 10” prints made from some of the negatives and> used a magnifying glass to determine what some of the words were. With a lot> of effort, Don and Bob were finally able to decipher just about every square> inch of the pages.> In addition, Bob and a colleague, who also had long experience with highly> classified reports, each found somebody knowledgeable about the Government> Printing Office and made some sense out of the little numbers on the bottom of> the pages. Everything they found was consistent with a typeset GPO document of> that era. For instance, although Bob’s digitally-typeset version of the manual> is very professional-looking, there are subtle differences between it and the> original typesetting, which was done mechanically. In other words, although> someone could create this document on a computer, and even use the same> typeface and typesize, there would be telltale signs that the pages were not> mechanically set.50 In other words, for all intents and purposes the Special Operations Manualappeared to be the genuine article.And that meant that there was some sort of highly classified crash-and-retrievalteam in place whose mission it was to recover downed aircraft or even UFOs. Butin any case, whether genuine or not, the document does not directly affect theNazi scenario one way or another, save that, if there was an independent postwarNazi group continuing its research into advanced aerodynes, and if one of theseever did crash on U.S. territory, then such a team would presumably handle it,and if one were not in place during the first such instance of a crash, then onewould quickly be organized by the American military to respond to a perceivedpotential threat.6. THE “COOPER-CANTWHEEL” DOCUMENTS But what of the other set of alleged Majic-12 documents, the so-called“Cooper-Cantwheel” set? Here, no matter where one stands within the ufologycommunity on the subject of the Majic-12 documents, the matter is somewhatmurkier, for as Friedman put it, “several of these documents also looked toogood to be true.”51 And in fact that turned out to be the case. One document inthe Cooper-Cantwheel set was a long letter from General George Marshall to CarlHumelsine, dated September 27, 1947. It was marked with the usual “TopSecret/Eyes Only” security classifications. It “referred to ‘MAJIC militarycommunications’ being sent to Humelsine.”52 Friedman needless to say checked outthe letter by sending a copy to the Marshall Foundation itself, and was informedthat it was> a retyped and slightly reworded version of a well-known letter from Marshall> to Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey during the 1944 campaign....> With this unambiguous fraud as a background, I became convinced that several> other items were retyped and slightly changed versions of old memos or> letters. For example, one document dealt with supposed travels to New Mexico> of “Archbishop” Spellman in the summer of 1947, during which he would be> protected by the military. By checking the New York Times Index, I determined> that Spellman was clearly in New York during the summer, did not travel to New> Mexico, and had already been named a Cardinal.53 And of course, one wonders why Francis Cardinal Spellman would need theprotection of the U.S. military to begin with, even if he did go to New Mexico!The Cooper-Cantwheel set of documents is just not credible.B. IMPLICATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS: GENERAL MONTAGUE, MAJESTIC-12, AND THE NAZISCENARIO(S) This brings us to the final, least-known, and for our purposes, perhaps the mostinteresting fact about the Eisenhower Briefing Document, and to the perhaps themost significant and interesting alleged member of the Majestic-12 Groupaccording to the same document: General Robert Montague. According to Friedman,Montague was a West Point classmate of General Nathan Twining, and wasresponsible “for the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico, not too far fromthe Roswell crash site.” An expert in mathematics, and had been “chosen to headthe very highly classified Armed Forces Special Weapons Center at Sandia Base,now Sandia National Laboratory, adjacent to Kirtland Air Force Base inAlbuquerque in early July 1947.54 Thus, Montague “was on the ground in asensitive part of the country,”55 indeed, in the very part of the country thatsome of the “saucers” appeared to have under regular surveillance.But there is one final, very important point for our purposes to be observedabout Montague: he was the commander of Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, the very“point of immigration” for many of the Nazi Paperclip scientists, including onevery significant one who maintained his legal residence there during the RoswellIncident, as will be seen in Part Three. At this juncture, however, it is to benoted that Montague’s presence on Majestic-12 hints at some sort of Naziconnection to the Roswell incident, howsoever tenuous it might be.At this juncture, the Nazi scenario and its implications begin to take shape,and it is best to outline some of them here in order to see how a change ofinterpretive context can affect the way in which this particular Majic-12document is perceived, regardless of whether it is authentic or deliberatedisinformation contrived by some “insider” to the project.Our first consideration is that there are several different types of the “NaziScenario” that must be mentioned:> 1) The “Paperclip” Scenario: this version of the Nazi scenario maintains that> if what crashed at Roswell was indeed Nazi, then it represented a continuation> of some of the research projects begun by German scientists before or during> the Second World War under American auspices after the war, as a part of some> American black project. It is this scenario that is the only version of the> Nazi Scenario ever mentioned by ufologists in connection with the Roswell> Incident, for it is very easily dismissible. For example, Friedman mentions> that the crashed Roswell vehicle could not have been a Nazi Horten Flying Wing> such as the Gotha-229, since the Horten Go-299’s “construction is two layers> of plywood with sawdust and carbon in between, which hardly matches the> Roswell wreckage.”56 And he is correct. Additionally, like many other Roswell> Incident researchers, Friedman correctly observes that if what crashed did> come from any American black project, “appropriate personnel would have been> seeking any ‘lost’ advanced vehicle by radar, on the ground, and by plane.> This clearly was not the case at Roswell.”57 Finally, many Roswell researchers> have pointed out that what crashed could not have been one of the many V-2> German missiles being launched in New Mexico, for two very simple reasons,> namely, no such launches took place around the time of the Roswell Incident,> and even if they did, any debris recovered would have been easily recognizable> and would not have fit the descriptions of the debris given by Major Marcel> and others. Finally, a crashed V-2 nosecone would have left a crater and only> one primary crash site, not two. No craters have ever been described by any of> the Roswell witnesses. So Friedman and those researchers are correct: whatever> crashed at Roswell, it was not a German Horten Flying Wing or a V-2. But to> exhaust these possibilities is not to exhaust the Nazi Scenario. 58 This> brings us to the next scenario:> 2) The Independent Nazi Scenario: This scenario posits that what crashed in> Roswell was Nazi, but that it came not from any American, or for that matter,> any Soviet project based on Nazi technology captured as war booty, but from an> independent postwar Nazi project. The further implication of this version is> the logical requirement that something about either the debris, the bodies, or> both, were recognizable to the American military and that convinced them they> were indeed dealing with such an independent Nazi project, and therefore, that> they were dealing with an organized and well-financed postwar extraterritorial> Nazi organization that had access to a high technology that could enter our> air space over our most sensitive installations with impunity. This would,> indeed, have called forth a high-level top secret response from the American> military, and would have also required a public relations effort to “spin” the> story into acceptable interpretations, namely, weather balloons and, at a> deeper level of misdirection and disinformation, extraterrestrials, for it> would hardly do for the American military to admit to the American people that> the old enemy was not only alive and well, but violating our airspace and> reconnoitering our more secret defense installations! This version must> account for the extraordinary properties of the Roswell debris, and the> alleged writing or hieroglyphics found on some of it.> 3) The Combined Nazi-ET Scenario would posit all the things present in the> “Independent Nazi Scenario” but would include an extraterrestrial component,> one indicating perhaps some collusion between the two. This version, however,> would suffer from all the criticisms of the ordinary extraterrestrial> interpretation of the Roswell Incident, namely, that none of the alleged> characteristics alleged for the recovered Roswell bodies compels toward an> extraterrestrial origin for them. Given this outline, the second consideration to be borne in mind is how thiscontext itself changes the interpretation of the Eisenhower Briefing Document,whether one considers it to be genuine, or considers it to be piece ofdisinformation contrived by someone on the inside. As we have seen, Friedmanhimself admits to this possibility, for if it was forged, it had to have beenforged by someone with detailed inside information.If genuine, then the document would point to some combination of the Paperclipand Combined Nazi-ET scenario, for General Montague’s presence implies almostthe same thing averred by Colonel Corso: there was something about Roswell thatlooked “too familiar.” Another possibility is that if the document is genuine,and if the Independent Nazi Scenario is true, then the military is hiding thetruth from Eisenhower himself. And in a certain way, this makes sense, forconsider for the sake of argument: if it were discovered that there was apostwar Nazi organization with access to such technologies, and it moreover wasviolating American airspace, it would be virtually impossible at that period ofhistory, before spy-satellites blanketed the globe with space-based cameras, todetermine where on earth it was coming from.But how would one deal with the bodies mentioned in the document, and with thestatements of their “human-like” appearance but “different evolutionarydevelopment?” For that matter, how would one deal with the document’s statementsthat Dr. Donald Menzel maintained that the creatures came from outside the solarsystem?Bluntly stated, the answer is very simple: there is no evidence internal to thedocument that compels to the extraterrestrial conclusion; all that the documentcontains is mere assertion; there are no details given either of the technologyor of the recovered that support or compel to this conclusion. Add to this thefact that according to the document itself, the recovered craft was consideredto be a short range reconnaissance craft. Here, it is to be noted carefully, thedocument does provide a corroborating detail, for it mentions the lack of“provisions” for food and waste disposal for a long range ship.In other words, if genuine, the Eisenhower Briefing Document suffers from thesame internal and dialectical contradiction of the Roswell Incident itself: itcontains no detail about the bodies compelling to an extraterrestrialconclusion, and on the other hand, the document itself, by suggesting a shortrange “reconnaissance” function, subtly contradicts the conclusions of thedocument itself. If it be objected that “reconnaissance to us” and“reconnaissance to ET” might be two different things, this is an argument fromsilence, for nothing whatsoever about the craft’s capabilities is known from thedocument, and nothing about its performance capabilities is known from theoriginal articulations of the Roswell Incident other than the properties of thedebris, which contain no indication of those capabilities. In short, any suchargument is an argument from silence.While this author personally thinks that the Eisenhower Briefing Document is aforgery, Friedman is absolutely correct, it is not a “simple hoax,” for itcontains too many details that only a very experienced forger would know, one,moreover, who most likely had some sort of intelligence connection to some groupresembling the Majestic-12 Group. So how does it fare under interpretation as adisinformation exercise?In my opinion, it holds up quite well as a disinformation exercise especially inthe context of the Independent Nazi Scenario, for one the one hand, it gives theappearance of upholding an extraterrestrial interpretation for Roswell.Moreover, it corroborates the wider context that ufologists have long contendedexists, namely, that some sort of super-secret government study group would havebeen formed in response to the UFO phenomenon, whether terrestrial or otherwise.Moreover, the list of members of the Majestic-12 group is entirely consistentwith such a group if either scenario is in view.But there, precisely, may lie the disinformation. For if the U.S. militaryrealized in July 1947 that it had recovered something Nazi and from anindependent extraterritorial Nazi organization, I submit that its response tothat recovery would have been identical: the military would have hit the “panic”button, buried the truth in a multi-layered tapestry of disinformation (possiblyincluding Roswell “extra-terrestrials”), and formed a top secret group composedof intelligence men, cryptographers, generals and admirals, not only to studywhat they recovered, find out where it came from, but moreover to form a plan ofaction about what to do about it. And very possibly they might have even keptthe President of the United States himself, or the Roswell research communityitself, “disinformed” of the truth.In this interpretive context, General Montague’s presence in the allegedMajestic-12 group — if one accepts the accuracy of the Briefing Document’smembership list for the sake of argument — makes even more sense. As thecommanding general of Fort Bliss and some of the sensitive defense and researchinstallations in New Mexico, he ultimately would have been deeply involved withthe Paperclip Nazis and their technologies. Indeed as we shall discover in PartThree, it is during this precise time frame of 1947 that the military beganquietly reinvestigating its brain trust of Paperclip Nazi scientists, and thatnew counter-intelligence alarm bells began to be sounded regarding some of theiractivities. So a case can — and eventually will — be made that thisinterpretation makes sense in a wider historical context, a context seldomconsidered in any detail by Roswell researchers in their race to excludeextraordinary terrestrial possibilities. Indeed, if something from anindependent Nazi project crashed in New Mexico that July of 1947, then the easysanitizing of those scientists’ pasts that occurred under Paperclip auspiceswould have come up for immediate reexamination.image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Kevin D.

Friedman1 No examination of the problematic of the Majic-12 documents would be completewithout a review of Kevin D. Randle’s study outlining the arguments againsttheir authenticity, though as with our examination of Friedman’s case for theauthenticity of a limited number of them, our examination of Randle’s argumentswill necessarily have to be brief and synoptic.One of the most interesting observations that Randle advances against theoverall general authenticity of most of the Majic-12 documents is a rather basicand obvious one:> I noticed immediately that they were on 8½-by-11-inch paper.> This may not seem too significant to most, but in 1947 and continuing until> the 1970s or later, the government used paper that was 8-by-10 inches.... (The> Majic-12) documents gave no hint of being typed on the smaller paper, but> because I was looking at photocopies, made from photographs and sent> anonymously, that observation had no significance.2 While it is difficult to ascertain why others sees “no significance” in the factthat the paper size of some of the documents is wrong, nonetheless it isimportant to note that Randle’s observation is true. In this author’s opinion,it is an important clue implying that the documents, whatever else they may be —whether simple “hoaxes” or more cleverly contrived “disinformation” — are notone hundred percent authentic. Randle’s observation implies that they aresomething less than that.A. THE ORIGINAL SET OF MAJIC-12 DOCUMENTS1. THE EISENHOWER BRIEFING DOCUMENT Randle’s, like Friedman’s, is concerned with more than mere general observationsabout the documents, but delves into significant difficulties that argue againsttheir total authenticity, and like Friedman, he lays out his case on adocument-by-document basis. The most important of these was, as was seen in theprevious chapter, the Eisenhower Briefing Document, because it clearly statesthat bodies were recovered, and moreover states the alleged Majestic-12 Grouphad concluded that, while human-like in appearance, they were extraterrestrials.As was also seen, no details were provided in the document to corroborate thatconclusion, nor were any details of the recovered technology provided to supportthat conclusion. Nonetheless, the question of the document’s authenticity orlack thereof is of premier importance for anyone investigating the RoswellIncident.However, Randle, who clearly is neither a “UFO” nor a “Roswell debunker,”quickly zeroes in on numerous difficulties with the document that argue — in hisopinion — persuasively against the document’s authenticity.> Cracks in the reliability of the Eisenhower briefing, which included a letter,> or memo, from Harry Truman authorizing the creation of MJ-12, began to appear> almost immediately. The skeptical community screamed hoax from the very> beginning. One of their arguments was that there was no provenance for the> documents. That means that no one knows where the documents originated and no> one could file any requests with any governmental agencies to acquire copies.> Moore and Shandera received them in the mail without a good clue as to who> sent the package or why it had been sent.3 As noted in the previous chapter, this meant that anyone arguing for or againstauthenticity could not do the sort of conventional documents analysis that wouldordinarily be done in such circumstances; one could not check the actual paperof the document, nor inks on the rubber-stamped classification markings, noranything of the sort. This left the internal evidence of the documentsthemselves.Indeed, according to Randle, he questioned Friedman himself about the naggingproblem of documentary provenance, and according to Randle, received thefollowing curious reply from Friedman:> Lack of provenance is bothersome, but understandable. Whoever filmed the> (Eisenhower Briefing Document) and/or planted the (Cutler-Twining memo) was> violating security by the filming and the release. Having a classified> document is not against the law. Being an authorized recipient who leaks it to> uncleared personnel is very much a violation. One might suggest that the lack> of provenance is an indication of genuineness.4 This is a curious statement in the light of the quotation from Friedman cited asan epigraph at the beginning of this chapter, for if one were plantingdeliberate disinformation within the Roswell research community, the lack ofanyone coming forward to say “Gotcha!” does not argue for the document’s onehundred percent authenticity. It argues only that the document could be eithercompletely authentic, or disinformation containing a mixture of truths andfalsehoods, for the last thing one would expect a disinformation agent to dowould be to step forward and expose the hoax.But for Randle, himself a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer, there areother problems, and these stem from the Eisenhower Briefing Document’s veryobvious violations of military protocols:> For me, however, the “smoking gun” that proved the Eisenhower briefing a hoax> was Roscoe Hillenkoetter’s rank (as cited on that document, ed.) according to> the proponents of MJ-12, Hillenkoetter was the man who prepared the briefing> for Eisenhower. His name appears on the document, listing him as the briefing> officer, and if MJ-12 is real and the documents authentic, there is no reason> why Hillenkoetter wouldn’t have been the briefing officer.> In 1952, Hillenkoetter was not an admiral, but a rear admiral, the difference> being the number of stars worn on the collar. An Admiral wears four and> Hillenkoetter wore but two. This might seem to be a trivial point, but it is> not. Contrary to what MJ-12 proponents will say, this is not a mistake that> Hillenkoetter would have made, it is a serious violation of military protocol.> It’s not something that Dwight Eisenhower, one of the few men to achieve> five-star rank, would ignore. It is the same as a captain claiming to be a> lieutenant colonel, or a sergeant claiming to be an officer.5Randle observes that it is true that in ordinary conversation with officers offlag or general rank that they are referred to simply as “admiral” or “general,”but his argument — in this author’s opinion — is telling, for> it is not true that when putting their names on documents, they will not> follow military protocol....> This is a long-winded way of saying that Hillenkoetter would have listed> himself as a rear admiral in the slot where the name of the briefing officer> appears. It means that the document was not prepared by Hillenkoetter or> anyone who worked for him, or by someone high in the government. It means, to> me, that this document is fraudulent.6 Any such document prepared for the briefing of a president or president-electwould have been typed letter-perfect, with no errors of grammar, misspellings ortypographical errors, much less sloppy listing of the ranks of any militaryofficers who appeared in it, and especially for retired General of the ArmiesDwight D. Eisenhower!7In the light of the above contextual problem — the preparation of a presidentialbriefing document containing errors of military protocol — there is anothersignificant problem, according to Randle.> One such error, which has been hotly debated, is the date on most of the MJ-12> documents. The Eisenhower briefing, for example, is dated “18 November,> 1952”... The problem here is a mixture of civilian and military dating> formats. The military format does not require the comma between the month and> the year.8 In an effort to defend the Eisenhower Briefing Document’s authenticity,Friedman, of course, produced examples of similar such “errors” in othermilitary documents.But this effort does not wash, according to Randle:> Stan Friedman and Bill Moore, proponents of MJ-12, have both produced military> documents that show the comma in the date where it didn’t belong and the zero> in the date where it didn’t belong. But once again we have some subtle> differences here. Many of these documents are from the British military, which> makes them irrelevant because the British have a slightly different system. Or> the documents are message traffic from teletype machines in which the zero is> positional and therefore irrelevant. Or they are documents from NATO, which> uses a still different system and is filled with military officers from allied> countries, not all from the United States, and are therefore irrelevant.> In other words, Friedman and Moore are arguing apples and oranges, but neither> seems to be aware of the difference. They just don’t address them. Rather,> they attack the messenger because they don’t understand the variations in> usage or how these things work inside the American military establishment.9 Randle’s point here, when considered in and of itself, appears to be nitpicking,for one can imagine a variety of circumstances under which dating formats mighthave been forgotten, or mistaken. But, in the context of the lack of theobservation of proper military protocol in what purports to be a presidentialbriefing document — for a former five-star general no less! — it becomes muchmore important. It is yet another clue that the document is not genuine.In fact, other researchers noticed that “the mistakes in the MJ-12 documentswere unique to those documents, which suggests they are fraudulent.”10 Accordingto Randle, Friedman responded to this criticism not by attempting “to refute thedata. Instead, he suggests that we ignore it because it comes from menassociated with CSICOP.”11 Of course, this is a case of “ignore the message”because of the messenger bearing it.As was also seen in the previous chapter, the Eisenhower Briefing Documentstates that there were also annexes or “Attachments” to the document, labeled inalphabetical order from A through H. But only one of these, Attachment “A” wasactually “leaked” with the main document itself. This attachment, as was seen,purported to be a memo from President Truman to Secretary of Defense JamesForrestal. But this attachment had its own special problems. Randle cites BarryGreenwood, an editor of the magazine Just Cause, for Greenwood discoveredsomething significant arguing against the attachment’s authenticity:> Page 2 of the Briefing Paper refers to the formation of MJ-12 by special> classified executive order of President Truman on 24 September, 1947... We> have checked the Truman Library’s listing of executive orders and found that> no orders were issued on 9/24. Executive order numbers 9891-9896 were issued> respectively on 9/15, two on 9/20, 9/23, 9/30 and 10/2/47, none even closely> resembling the MJ-12 subject. There is no gap in the number sequence for these> dates so none are missing. Further, the number quoted in Attachment “A” of the> Briefing Paper, #092447... is not an executive order number but the date of> President Truman’s memo, 9/24/47. Executive orders are not numbered by date> but are numbered sequentially, and at the time the numbers were only four> digits.12 This was another telling clue arguing against authenticity, for the numberingformat of the so-called “executive order” was simply nowhere close to the actualfilling system used for such orders.Against this argument, Randle states that Friedman responded that the “Trumanmemo was a special classified executive order that wouldn’t be found with theunclassified and regular executive orders.”13 As such it would have been subjectto “special handling because of its high classification.”14 However, there was aproblem with this argument as well, for while> That seems to be logical thinking on Friedman’s part and is consistent with> the rules and regulations in effect at the time the briefing was prepared, it nevertheless falls short. Indeed,> had MJ-12 been a legitimate executive order, it would have fallen into the> numerical sequence, even if it was highly classified. A paper, titled,> “Congressional Research Service, the Library of Congress on Government> Operations, March 17, 1987,” states that “during the past 70 years, some 40> confidential or security executive orders have been occasionally issued. These> were not published, but they were accounted for in the numbering system.”15 Of course, Friedman was not about to let this pass either, and his responseinitiated another exchange of broadsides and salvos between the two researchers:> Friedman, however, is now saying, “It is not labeled [sic et passim] as a> presidential Executive Order... Would everybody please read the short, Sept.> 24, 1947, memo again? It is not labeled Special Classified Executive Order. It> has no number on it... I repeat it is false to say it is listed as Executive> Order #.... It is false to say it is labeled as SCEO# or anything else.” But Randle’s response indicates either that Friedman forgot to load the cannonswith shells, and was firing off mere powder with lots of smoke and thunder butno ammunition, or that the salvo was improperly aimed, or both:> ...(The) Eisenhower briefing had a listing of the attachments, only one of> which was forwarded. Attachment A contains, according to the briefing itself,> “Special Classified Executive Order #092447.”> So, once again we have something that does not match the proper format or> regulations that were in force in 1947. It could be suggested, and has been,> that the Roswell crash and recovery was a unique event, so the paperwork> surrounding it would be unique, but that doesn’t wash. Even for an event of> this magnitude, the simple regulations surrounding the creation of executive> orders, would have been followed, because there would be no reason not to. Yet> these regulations all seem to have been ignored in this case. This should> raise additional red flags.16 In this author’s opinion, Randle’s arguments are persuasive at least of thepoint that the Eisenhower Briefing Document cannot be taken as simply a onehundred percent genuine document, and therefore, any evidentiary value of itsinternal statements and assertions must be evaluated carefully, and inconnection to the external evidence that researchers of the Roswell Incidentitself have uncovered.Randle’s conclusions, however, are much more pointed and much more exclusive:> What we have, in the Eisenhower briefing and the Truman memo, are documents> that do not conform to the styles used in the proper time frames. We find a> number of problems, from Hillenkoetter’s rank being wrong to the very> technical details for issuing an executive order, which are also wrong. All> this is suggestive of mistakes and that the documents are frauds.17 Consequently, for Randle, the Eisenhower Briefing Document was a hoax, plain andsimple.2. THE CUTLER TWINING MEMO Another component of the “Original Set” of Majic-12 documents was the so-calledCutler-Twining memorandum, which summoned General Nathan Twining to the WhiteHouse for a special top secret meeting with President Eisenhower. This, it willbe recalled, was discovered by Jamie Shandera while he and fellow Roswellresearcher Bill Moore were researching in the National Archives. The memorandumwas typed on onionskin paper, and was found sandwiched between folders in a boxof records. As was seen from the previous chapter, Moore’s research indicatedthat the watermark on the paper was indeed authentic for the period, and wasfound on bid lots of stationary that were purchased from the Fox Paper companyin Wisconsin during that period.But, as Randle observes, there are problems with the Cutler-Twining memorandumas well:> The problem with the memo, though it had been found at the National Archives,> and in a box that was among the boxes of recently declassified material, was> that it didn’t belong there. There was no record of the memo being in that box> before it was examined by Shandera and Moore. It hadn’t been discovered by the> review conducted by the Air Force officers as part of the declassification of> the other material in the box, and if it was authentic, it should have been> removed from the box for a declassification review by the (National Security> Council). There was a further problem:> We could take the argument even deeper, but there seems no reason to do so.> The National Archives, where the memo was found, made it clear that their> certification of a copied document merely means that it is an accurate copy of> a document in their possession, and not that the document itself is genuine.> To provide the Cutler-Twining memo with that sort of pseudo-pedigree might be> the reason it was planted there in the first place, and all parties seem to> agree that it was planted. In other words, Randle believes the document was planted and that since the AirForce itself had no record of the document during its declassification review ofthe materials in the box in which it was found, that it is most likely thereforeanother fraudulent document and a deliberately planted one at that.B. THE COOPER-CANTWHEEL DOCUMENTS But what of the other set of documents, the so-called “Cooper-Cantwheel”documents? As we saw in the previous chapter, these were almost too good to betrue and were so “perfect” that even Friedman was skeptical of all but a few ofthem. Like all the other Majic-12 documents, the primary problem was theirprovenance.19 But one did not have to look very far nor very long to find otherproblems. Not the least of these was the fact that some of the Cooper-Cantwheeldocuments could be traced to genuine “donor documents,” whose diction andformatting the leaker of the “Cooper-Cantwheel” set simply used as a model toconcoct his forgeries, changing the appropriate words here and there to come upwith a legitimate-looking “top secret” UFO document.20But an even bigger problem was noticed by the famous British ufologist TimothyGood.> (Good) at one time believed MJ-12 to be a real committee and believed the> early documents, at least, to be authentic, (and) had received a number of> letters from Tim Cooper. On October 4 and October 7, 1991, Cooper wrote to> Good. Later when Good obtained a copy of the 4th Annual MJ-12 Report,” he> noticed a number of similarities between that document and the letters he’d> received from Cooper. Specifically, Good said that the uppercase G, N, and the> number 8 were slightly elevated in relation to other letters on the> typewritten lines.> Robert Wood noted these and suggested that it was the result of a typist who> hadn’t pushed the shift bar fully when striking the letter. That resulted in> the capital letter being raised slightly above the rest of the text. Of> course, other capital letters should have shown the same thing, unless the> problem was with those specific letters on Cooper’s typewriter. And the shift> bar is not used when typing a number. That means the problem was a mechanical> flaw in the typewriter, and could be considered a “fingerprint” of that> particular machine.21 In other words, Cooper himself appeared to be the origin of what were nowconsidered by most within the ufology community to be completely fabricateddocuments!The worst problem was that Drs. Robert and Ryan Wood — whose “Cooper-Cantwheel”documents shall be examined more closely in Part Three — had arranged for apolygraph examination for Timothy Cooper hismelf, and the results were not, tosay the least, favorable, for according to the Woods, they “showed deception insome of his answers,” a result which surprised the Woods. Nevertheless, theyconcluded that this was because “of his continuing desire to protect theidentity of two sources that he refuses to identify.”22For Randle, the Cooper-Cantwheel chapter of the Majic-12 documents episodebecomes almost an icon for the whole affair:> The lie detector test Tim Cooper failed should raise a red flag. The fact that> Cantwheel is unavailable for interview should raise a red flag. The fact that> some of the documents appear to have been typed on Cooper’s typewriter should> raise a red flag. That some of these documents are retyped versions of other,> authentic documents should raise some red flags. The fact that we can trace> documents only to Cooper, or Moore and Shandera, and no further, should raise> a red flag.23 But for Randle, the entire Majic-12 episode raised not only red flags, but evenmore disturbing possibilities.C. FRIEDMAN’S REPLIES, AND A METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTION In the previous chapters I have already alluded to the fact that the threeprincipal Roswell Incident investigators — in its second and third articulations— namely Charles Berlitz, William (Bill) Moore, and Stanton T. Friedman, areeither strongly suspected of having connections to American intelligence(Berlitz), or have self-admitted to involvement in the American military’s blackprojects from the 1950s and early 1960s (Friedman), or have confessed to theufology investigative community that they allowed themselves to be used by theU.S. military-intelligence complex as disinformation agents in return for accessto genuine classified UDFO information (Moore). And in Randle’s case, we haveyet again another prominent ufologist and Roswell researcher who himself is aformer Air Force intelligence officer.All this, of course, suggests the possibility that the entire Majic-12 operationmay very well have been a disinformation operation, and that the documentsthemselves were planted by the researchers to whom they were allegedly leaked.Randle clearly suggests this very possibility:> Those who believe that MJ-12 is authentic often point out that to fake these> documents, the forger would need a great deal of complex historical knowledge.> It wouldn’t be something that someone on the outside could do. This was an> argument for the creation being the work of insiders.24 Indeed, we have already seen from the previous chapter that Friedman himselfmade precisely this point. But if one grants that point for the sake ofargument, then that very same point means the documents are neither completehoaxes, nor are they “plain straight legitimate,” to use Friedman’s apt phrase.It means that the probable truth lies somewhere in between those two verydialectical poles.But Randle goes further, clearly implying that Friedman himself may have beeninvolved in “leaking” the original Eisenhower Briefing Document:> In the past I argued that Stan Friedman suggested that he and Bill Moore did> have this knowledge. In The Roswell report, edited by George M. Eberhart for> the Center for UFO Studies and published in 1991, Friedman wrote: “The simple> fact of the matter is that Moore, Shandera, and I had already picked up on all> the names of the (Eisenhower Briefing Document’s) list prior to the receipt of> the film (except for Dr. Donald Menzel) as a result of the many days spent in> historical archival research that began a decade ago because of the Roswell> incident.... We had noted who was where in early July 1947 when the Roswell> incident occurred...”> But Friedman’s research, along with that of Moore, was even more in-depth.> Karl Pflock, in his column Pflock Ptalk,” published in Jim Moseley’s> semiserious and periodically published Saucer Smear, wrote: In 1976, ufologist> Brad Sparks discovered Menzel had a UFO sighting near Alamogordo, New Mexico,> when he was in the area in 1949... Then in 1977, Sparks circulated a paper on> Menzel, his presence in New Mexico in the 1940s, and his sighting and his> distortions and outright attempts to suppress it.”> Pflock noted that one of Sparks’ readers was Friedman, showing that Friedman> was aware of Menzel’s Ufological history. That Friedman knew about this is> important.25 What Randle is suggesting is that Friedman’s knowledge of Menzel’s UFO sightingis important because Friedman clearly knew that there was more to Menzel thanmerely being a debunker, and knew this long before the Eisenhower BriefingDocument’s list of Majestic-12 members was ever “leaked” to Jaimie Shandera.Thus, Randle is suggesting that Friedman’s claims to have found Menzel’spresence on the Eisenhower Briefing Document’s list of Majestic-12 members alittle curious, is a bit disingenuous on Friedman’s part. And that implies thatFriedman himself could have been one of those “insiders” with the specializedknowledge to concoct such a document.However, there is one significant fact that argues strongly against Friedman’sinvolvement in any such nefarious activity, and it is one that Friedman himselfhas never brought up, nor is ever likely to do. As was seen in the previouschapter, one of those alleged members on the Eisenhower Briefing Document’s listof Majestic-12 Group members was General Montague, the commanding general ofFort Bliss, Texas, home to many if not most of the Paperclip Nazis of Nazirocket expert Werner Von Braun’s rocket team, one of whom — as will be seen inPart Three — was involved in a whole lot more than mere rockets in Nazi Germany!But why is this important? It is important because as we also saw from previouschapters in general, and in particular Friedman’s own examination of theEisenhower Briefing Document in the immediately previous chapter, Friedman hasnever considered any version of the Nazi scenario of Roswell other than thefirst, and weakest, “Paperclip” version of it, and he has rightly and for soundreasons dismissed it. Why then would Friedman draw attention to other possibleand much stronger versions of that Nazi Scenario by including the name of thevery commanding general of Fort Bliss, and thereby invite the inevitablescrutiny on these men and some of their wartime activities for the Third Reich,activities which in turn are a potential threat to the very extraterrestrialinterpretation of the Roswell Incident that he himself advocates?It thus appears that, in the end, if one wishes to pursue this type of adhominem thinking to its inevitable and ultimate logical reductio, one would haveto cast a pall of suspicion not only over the research of Friedman, but ofRandle, Moore, and Berlitz themselves, and, not stopping there, would have tocast a pall of suspicion over the original “flying saucer” press release ofFirst Lieutenant Walter Haut of the 509th Bomb Group itself, and as well overthat of the U.S. Army Air Force’s subsequent weather balloon story itself, sinceall of these various articulations of the Roswell Incident come from people withtheir own obvious and self-admitted connections either to military intelligenceor military black projects.Such a methodology is, of course, doomed to failure, since nothing whatsoevercould be taken as a given, and everything would be up for construction andinterpretation. Finally, such a method — at least for this author — simply hasno basis in fact, since having met only one of these Roswell researchers, andthen only briefly at that, he has no reason to malign or impugn the motivationsor character of any of them. Such tactics are also unfair, for they unfairlyforce someone accused of such activity — in this case Mr. Friedman — into thelamentable situation where they are required to prove a negative, namely, thatthey were not involved in such activity.In this author’s opinion, in the end both Friedman and Randle are correct.Randle is correct because there are too many errors of protocol and detail forthe documents in general, and for the Eisenhower Briefing Document inparticular, to be “plain straight legitimate” (to employ Friedman’s phrase onceagain). But by the same token, Friedman is also correct; the documents displayfar too much detailed information for their contents to be simply and cavalierlydismissed. The details betoken an origin from someone or some group withintimate “inside” knowledge.As such, for purposes of this study, we conclude for the sake of argument thatthe documents are instruments of deliberate disinformation; they are neither“plain straight legitimate” nor are the “pure hoaxes,” but they contain amixture of truth and falsehood. The questions now are: if some of them areinstruments of deliberate information, then what is the nucleus of truth inthem, what is the context of untruth in them, and for whom is the disinformationintended, and why?As instruments of disinformation, they are subject to construction andinterpretation, from their internal statements alone, and just as thepro-extraterrestrial interpretation can be construed from them inconjunction with a comparison to the external evidences presented by RoswellIncident researchers, so too can a purely terrestrial and, indeed, Nazi Scenariointerpretation be construed from them.Our survey of the articulations of the Roswell Incident has thus drawn to aclose, and the actual task of arguing the Nazi Scenario itself now begins. Allthe pieces and players are in position. As has been suggested immediately above,any construction of the Majic-12 documents along those interpretive lines willdepend on the very same external dataset — the debris and the bodies — that wereused to argue the extraterrestrial interpretation of the Incident.So, to the Nazi Scenario, we now, finally, turn.image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Stanton T.

Allthe pieces and players are in position. And as has been suggested in Part Two,any construction of the Majic-12 documents along those interpretive lines willdepend on the very same external dataset — the debris, and the bodies — thatwere used to argue the extraterrestrial interpretation of the Incident.And so to the Nazi Scenario we now finally turn. In order to see how thatscenario fits so snuggly with the basic facts of the Roswell Incident, however,it is now necessary to summarize the evidence and arguments of the precedingchapters, to offer a preliminary analysis, and to state our basic methodologicalassumptions in arguing the Nazi scenario of the Incident.A. SUMMARY As is by now abundantly evident, the story of the Roswell Incident has been toldin several discrete and distinct “articulations,” and it is to be noted that theearliest articulations concern themselves only with the recovery of atechnology, not with the recovery of any bodies — terrestrial or otherwise — ofthe crew. Additionally, those first articulations of the Incident and of thetechnology recovered alternate between two dialectical polarities, oneemphasizing the recovery of something extraordinary and exotic, and the otheremphasizing the recovery of something purely mundane and, in a word, unexciting.Moreover, as is by now apparent, many of those witnesses claiming to have seenbodies of some sort are either impeached witnesses, or in many cases,“witnesses” who are now dead, and whose stories are told by second-hand sourceswho in turn have often impeached their own credibility by varying theiraccounts, often in significant ways. In fact, the most consistent feature of theRoswell Incident throughout all its articulations is that the recovered debrispossessed extraordinary properties, and that its recovery initiatedextraordinary efforts on the part of the military to cover-up what it hadrecovered and to obfuscate the details of that recovery down to contemporarytimes.1. TWO DATASETS: There are consequently two datasets that any theory of the Roswell Incident mustseek to rationalize: (1) the debris, the description of which is consistentacross time and various witnesses as has been seen in the previous pages, and(2) the bodies, the description of which is not consistent over time nor overseveral witnesses in spite of claims to the contrary, and moreover whosewitnesses have in turn either been impeached, or shown to be based uponsecond-hand-and-dead man’s testimony in many instances, or whom other data hasrevealed were unlikely to have been in the area in order actually to see suchbodies.For example, in the case of the allegation that Grady Barnett saw both thecrashed disc and dead bodies, Randle and Schmitt showed that information fromhis wife’s diary indicated that this was unlikely.2 On the other hand, in thecase of the mortician Glenn Dennis, for many years considered the “starwitness”3 for the claim of recovered dead extraterrestrial bodies, that witnessimpeached himself by admitting to having lied to Roswell researchers. In thecases of Frank Kaufmann, Gerald Anderson, and Jim Ragsdale, those witnesses’stories were shown to contain so many internal inconsistencies that theresearchers who initially located them no longer stand behind their testimony.For example, Randle no longer stands behind Frank Kaufmann or Jim Ragsdale orGlenn Dennis,4 and Berliner and Friedman no longer accredit Anderson.52. THE WITNESSES FOR THE BODIES AND THE ALLEGED “CONSISTENCY” OF THEIRDESCRIPTIONS The fundamental problem with witness descriptions of the bodies may be morefully understood by an examination of the following table. In the first columnis the witness’ name, in the second, his or her status(i.e., is the testimonyfirst-hand, second-hand, is the witness impeached, or not credible on othergrounds?), and in the third column is a brief summary of the description theygave of the recovered bodies.Table 1: Witness Descriptions of the Bodies and the Status of that Witness image [images/00044.jpg] image [images/00045.jpg] image [images/00046.jpg] image [images/00047.jpg] image [images/00048.jpg] image [images/00049.jpg] Despite the claims of some Roswell researchers that the witnesses’ descriptionsof the dead “aliens” is consistent,6 what the above table reveals is a list ofcharacteristics that is not only remarkably inconsistent in its details, butthat inconsistency is magnified by the fact that there is no agreed-upon numberof the recovered bodies. Additionally, the table also reveals how much of thetestimony concerning the dead bodies is in fact second-hand and dead man’stestimony, and much of that from witnesses now discredited by many within theRoswell research community.But the table reveals something else, and something very significant. If onediscounts the stories of Beverly Bean and her father, Sergeant Melvin Brown, andthat of Glenn Dennis, and if one allows the testimony of all the others to standfor the sake of argument, then the list of the remaining characteristics of the“extraterrestrials” is very revealing when all the details are compiledtogether, for what is described are beings with:> 1) Large heads, out of proportion to the rest of the body;> 2) Small stature, that of “ten-year-old” children and between four and five> feet in height;> 3) Eyes that are slanted, larger-than-normal, or possessing some other> peculiarity;> 4) four or five fingers;> 5) “human like hands and feet” with normal joints and digits;> 6) Small mouths, noses, and ears, or in one case, no mouth or nose;> 7) In the case of Mac Brazel there is the mere assertion, made under pressure,> that the beings “were not monkeys,” “were not human,” and “were not green,”> but no corroborating detail is given to support this conclusion. And in the> case of the Eisenhower Briefing Document examined in Part Two, the> extraterrestrial conclusion is offered in the document, but again without any> supporting or corroborating details. Viewed in this way, one must ask those researchers favoring the extraterrestrialinterpretation of the Roswell Incident the following question: what specificdetail in this list compels to the conclusion that the bodies — if any wereindeed recovered at all — were extraterrestrial? We shall see that this list iscapable of wholly terrestrial explanations and rationalizations.3. THE STATE OF THE STORY OF THE ROSWELL INCIDENT: THE BASIC FACTS AND RANDLE’SAND KORFF’S CONCLUSIONS The table also illuminates the state of the Roswell Incident story after all itsarticulations, for if one grants the remaining witnesses’ accounts of thebodies, then what Roswell Incident involves is:> 1) The recovery of some extraordinary debris;> 2) The recovery of very human-sounding and ordinary bodies; and,> 3) A reaction and cover-up by the military suggesting a sense of urgency and> perhaps anxiety about the incident, and an ongoing cover-up and obfuscated> story that, as was seen, may have involved disinformation in its very first> articulation, namely, the army’s press release claiming it had recovered a> flying saucer;> 4) This cover-up included two officially promulgated balloon theories — the> initial weather balloon story offered by brigadier general Roger Ramey and the> later 1994 Air Force Mogul Balloon theory — which fail to take adequate> account of the “memory metal” characteristics of the debris, and of its> extraordinary strength. If one discounts the detail of the recovery of bodies that was added in laterarticulations of the story and by witnesses whose stories are related viasecond-hand testimony or whose stories are in dispute, then one ends with theoriginal first articulation of the Incident, with the recovery of extraordinarydebris and a military operation to recover it and keep it covered-up longafterward. The Roswell Incident has thus ended where it began, with its firstarticulation. One is left to explain why the U.S. Army Air Force would reactwith such urgency to the crash and recovery of what is evidently ratherextraordinary technology and — if the bodies are admitted — some very ordinaryand human-sounding bodies.4. THE METHODOLOGY OF PROPONENTS OF THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTERPRETATION These considerations now illuminate the deep methodological flaws in thearguments of many of those advocating the extraterrestrial interpretation of theRoswell Incident. As was seen, the tendency amongst those advocating thatinterpretation is to argue that the “bodies interpret the debris,” and tomaintain that the descriptions of those bodies are so extraordinary as to arguepersuasively for the conclusion that what was crashed and recovered was ofextraterrestrial origin and interplanetary capability.However, in point of fact, and as is now evident, when one discounts the dubioustestimony of the two witnesses who provide the most sensational and bizarredetails for the recovered bodies, namely Glenn Dennis and Sergeant Melvin Brownvia his daughter Beverly Bean’s ever-shifting story, then what remains is theexact opposite of what those researchers are advocating, for it is the debristhat is extraordinary and the bodies that are ordinary! Hence, if one were tofollow their own methodology and argue that the “bodies” form the interpretivecontext for the debris, one would have to conclude that the debris, whileextraordinary, is terrestrial. We are left, once again, with somethingextraordinary that is no mere balloon, that is quite human, and that must becovered-up at all costs, either because of the extraordinary nature of itstechnology, or for some other reason, or both. It follows from this observationthat something about the debris was extraordinary not only in terms of itsimplied technology but possibly its origin as well, and that one, or the other,or both were factors motivating the military to its sense of urgency and tocontinue a cover-up to our own day. (After all, if the Mogul Balloon theoryfails to account for all the debris properties adequately — as it most certainlydoes — then this means a cover-up is still in force).5. THE DIALECTIC OF ROSWELL These considerations in turn recall the peculiar “dialectic of Roswell” that wasreferred to in Part One. Throughout our survey of the Roswell researchcommunity’s own writings, a peculiar dialectic of oppositions was observed inthe interpretations offered for the incident. On the one hand, there is thepro-extraterrestrial pole of the dialectic — amply demonstrated in the approachof Randle and Schmitt — that argues that the Incident was so extraordinary ithad to be extraterrestrial, while on the other side, any case arguing for aterrestrial interpretation trivializes the Incident into, as they put it, themerely “mundane.”And this dialectical polarity was present in the Incident from its firstarticulation, since the military itself proffered both an extraordinaryinterpretation that implied an extraterrestrial basis, and a merely mundane andordinary one. And that dialectic persisted in the work of Colonel Corso, oftenmanifesting both poles within the very same context and in juxtaposedstatements! What has been carefully excluded by both “believer” and “skeptic” inall articulations of the Roswell Incident examined thus far, and therefore, whathas never been adequately investigated, is the possibility of an extraordinarybut terrestrial explanation for the Incident.6. THE ROSWELL DIALECTIC AND THE PRINCIPAL RESEARCHERS Nothing discloses the peculiarity of this dialectic nor the consistency of itspattern better than an examination of the backgrounds of the principal Roswellresearchers themselves. A table will once again assist in exhibiting theconsistency of this dialectical pattern, and who may ultimately be behind it:Table of Principal Roswell Researchers image [images/00050.jpg] image [images/00051.jpg] What emerges from this table is the fact that the pattern of the originaldialectical articulation of the Roswell Incident by the military is consistentover time, for one finds in this list individuals with past or presentconnections to the military or to intelligence or to black projects, and, takentogether, the statements of these individuals continue to advocate one or theother pole of that dialectic, and in Corso’s case, both at the same time.The implications of this inconvenient fact are both disturbing and profound, forthey suggest that there is a degree of military and intelligence penetrationinto the Roswell research community, which penetration is for the expresspurpose of keeping interpretive efforts of the Incident locked into the verysame dialectical matrix as formed the original articulation of the story. Thepattern is all too suggestive and reminiscent of the original U.S. Army AirForce’s two entirely different and dialectically opposed “spins” of theIncident, with Colonel William Blanchard, First Lieutenant Walter Haut, andMajor Jesse Marcel advocating an extraordinary basis of the event — therecovered flying saucer explanation — and Brigadier General Roger Rameyorchestrating a hasty press conference to explain it all away as a case of themistaken identity of a common weather balloon. The question once again is, Whygo to such extraordinary lengths to obfuscate the Incident between these twopoles by a kind of technique of dialectical crisis management?B. ANALYSIS1. METHODOLOGY OF PART THREE > Given all these considerations, our methodology in Part Three is accordingly> very simple, but involves several components:> 1) The Nazi Scenario must be shown to make rational sense for the length of> the cover-up of the Roswell Incident;> 2) The Nazi Scenario must also give an adequate rationalization for the> motivations for that cover-up, whether technological, political, or both, and> give an adequate rationalization for the sense of urgency the military> exhibited in the Roswell recovery and cover-up;> 3) The Nazi Scenario must make contextual sense of the documents adduced by> the Roswell community that are of undisputed authenticity;> 4) The Nazi Scenario must made rational sense of the wider historical context> in which the Incident occurred, and give an adequate rational basis for the> introduction of any wider historical context;> 5) The Nazi Scenario must rationalize the establishment of any top secret UFO> study group within and by the U.S. government;> 6) The Nazi Scenario must give adequate demonstration that a postwar> independent Nazi organization existed, and that it had adequate financing,> facilities, and personnel to continue ongoing research into those areas of> science and technology that directly bear on the recovery of an extraordinary> craft at Roswell, that it did indeed conduct such research, and that it had a> sufficient base of operations to conduct over-flights of the United States> with such technology without fear of its home base or bases being detected;> 7) The Nazi Scenario must give an adequate rationalization of the Roswell> debris;> 8) The Nazi Scenario must give an adequate rationalization of the Roswell> “recovered bodies”. The last two points require further commentary. In arguing for a terrestrialrationalization of the particularities of the descriptions of the debris and therecovered bodies, the method adopted will be that neither should form theinterpretive context for the other, but that both should be shown to have aplausible terrestrial basis from an inductive and argued case. Thus, the debris’extraordinary properties are granted, and a case for its terrestrial originswill be argued and speculative explanations for each detail will be advanced.Similarly, by excluding the impeached testimony of Glenn Dennis and the dubioustestimony of Beverly Bean concerning her father, Sergeant Melvin Brown, and hisalleged descriptions of the recovered bodies, the remaining list of details ofthe recovered bodies will be argued on an inductive and terrestrial basis forthe sake of argument, notwithstanding that most of this testimony comes fromsecond-hand and dead-man sources.Consequently, the method employed here in Part Three is the synthesis implied bythe Roswell dialectic itself, namely, that what crashed was an extraordinarytechnology of wholly terrestrial origins, whose origins nonetheless were alsoextraordinary and politically explosive. The Nazi scenario fulfills all theserequirements and then some, as we shall see.2. THE DEBRIS AND THE WITNESSES Thus stated, the principal dataset that possesses the primary importance is thedebris and its extraordinary properties, and thus, another table will help tosummarize those properties and to refresh our memories:Table of Witnesses and Debris Characteristics Reported image [images/00052.jpg] image [images/00053.jpg] image [images/00054.jpg] image [images/00055.jpg] image [images/00056.jpg] Summarizing all of this, one has the following different types of debris andtheir properties:> 1) The Foil-Memory Metal:> a) Thin, no thicker than the foil in a pack of cigarettes;> b) Not bendable;> c) Not able to be dented with a sledgehammer;> d) Not able to be cut or torn;> e) Can be wrinkled but not creased;> f) Porous and able to be “blown through”;> g) Darker than normal tin-foil, more like lead foil;> h) Lightweight> i) After wrinkling would resume its original shape (memory metal)> 2) The “Hieroglyphics”:> a) Pink and purple in color;> b) Like Egyptian hieroglyphics but without the animal figures;> c) Similar to southwestern American Indian petroglyphs;> d) Some characters appear on a “tape” showing pastel flowers or designs;> e) “Numbers” that are arranged in columns> f) Resembles Japanese or Chinese writing or designs on firecrackers;> 3) The “Balsa Wood” Beams:> a) Flexible but not breakable by hand;> b) Material has the hieroglyphic writing on it;> c) Characters drawn by Jesse Marcel, Jr., under hypnosis;> d) Darker than ordinary balsa wood;> e) Not able to be cut or scratched;> 4) The Filaments:> a) Smaller than string but larger than thread;> 2) Monofilament;> 5) Parchment-like material:> a) Material could not be broken;> b) Material could not be burned with a cigarette lighter;> c) Material contained “numbers” like “hieroglyphics.” 3. THE INADEQUACY OF ANY BALLOON THEORY From the above list it will be readily apparent that any balloon theory, andparticularly the Mogul Balloon Theory, is inadequate to account for all thesedetails, for while the tape used on the Mogul balloons superficially resemblesthe descriptions of the “hieroglyphics,” the other properties of the materials —super-hard and lightweight “memory metal,” the porous nature of some of thematerial, the unbreakability of some materials, and the monofilamentcharacteristic of the “fibers”8 — run directly counter to any of the materialsused in the Mogul Balloons.On the other hand, the descriptions of the hieroglyphics in terms of“petroglyphs,” “numbers,” and “Chinese or Japanese writing” is stronglysuggestive of terrestrial origins. Indeed, as has been noted in the previouspages, the commanding officer of the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell, ColonelWilliam Blanchard, told his wife that his original inclination was to believethat the debris came from something Soviet.9Consequently, the debris itself points to something extraordinary but ofterrestrial origin, and thus the debris itself constitutes the contradiction tothe “dialectic of Roswell” since it falls utterly outside the contrivedopposition of the “extraordinary and extraterrestrial” to the “terrestrial,ordinary, and mundane.” This in turn suggests that it is the debris itself fromwhich the dialectic is designed to deflect attention.4. THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST SOMETHING EXOTIC BUT TERRESTRIAL Advocates of the extraterrestrial interpretation of the Roswell Incident arenot, of course, oblivious to the above implications of the debris. On thecontrary, they have advanced arguments against its being of a terrestrialnature, and a glance at them reveals further hidden assumptions underlying theextraterrestrial interpretation.For example, Berliner and Friedman advance the following argument in Crash atCorona:> ...what was being tested in 1947 is not secret today. Either it met its> requirements and was placed in production, or it failed in one or more ways> and was sent to the scrap heap. Regardless, it would have been declassified> and long since would have become common knowledge. By now, even if it had been> totally successful, it would have been rendered obsolete by subsequent> developments.10 Randle and Schmitt echo this argument and add new twists:> In short, no mundane explanation works. A (black projects) craft classified as> top secret in 1947 would no longer be classified today...> Balloons, practice atomic bombs, experimental aircraft, and Soviet spy planes> cannot have been responsible for the debris discovered by Mac Brazel. No> alternative, nonextraordinary hypotheses account for the strange metals with> strange properties described by the men and women who handled them. No> evidence attests to the presence of a balloon, a practice bomb, or an> experimental aircraft. Such explanations have one fatal fact in common: an> utter absence of supporting evidence.11 There are a number of implicit assumptions in both commentaries that must now berendered explicit.> 1) The Technology could not still be secret: The assumption underlying this> argument is that in the normal course of human engineering and technical> progress, even among black projects, that there can be no scientific or> technological breakthrough sufficiently in advance of publicly available> concepts and technologies that would warrant a classification down to our own> time. But in effect, this is an argument from silence, for we simply do not> know what such projects have achieved. That being said, however, there is a> wide and extensive database known to most inventors, engineers, and scientists> that strongly suggest that promising human technologies — when they are known> at all — are quickly suppressed and sidelined and their inventors effectively> silenced.12 The suppression of human technologies from Tesla to Farnsworth> suggests that there is something about the concepts embodied in those> technologies that are well in advance of “public consumption physics.” In any> case, the numerous examples of suppression that are known suggest that, in> Roswell’s case, this argument lacks warrant, and also suggests that a similar> case of technological suppression may be a motivating factor without having to> invoke “extraterrestrial origins” to justify its continued classification.> 2) Technology, and the object’s alleged extraterrestrial origins, are the main> reasons for maintaining secrecy until the present time: As noted in the> citation from Randle and Schmitt, the “Roswell dialectic” is clearly in play> in their interpretation, in that anything classified this long, if classified> for technological reasons, must be because of its extraterrestrial nature. On> the face of it, this lacks warrant for all the reasons surveyed in point one> above. Randle’s and Schmitt’s remarks, however, disclose a second implicit> tendency within the extraterrestrial interpretation of the Roswell Incident,> namely, that the technology is so classified because of its origins, which,> they argue, must be extraterrestrial since a similar secretive human> development of extraordinary technology seems to them to be unjustified. The> “Roswell dialectic” to a certain sense compels these conclusions. But Randle> and Schmitt are correct in one sense, in that the origins of the recovered> debris might be politically explosive enough to warrant extreme classification> down to our own time. It is perhaps the extreme irony of previous Roswell research that thoseresearchers themselves have pointed the way to the resolution of thatdialectical dilemma, for they themselves have pointed out the flaws of witnesstestimony concerning the recovery of bodies; they themselves have given a listof physiological features of said bodies that are far from sufficient toconclude their extraterrestrial origins even if one grants that bodies wererecovered; they themselves have done the research to show conclusively that noAmerican experimental project or aircraft was involved; they themselves havestrongly intimated that one reason for maintaining such extraordinary secrecysurrounding the event was because of the politically explosive nature of theorigins of what was recovered.Any resolution of the “dialectic of Roswell” must show that the technology,while extraordinary, is within the possibilities of human achievement, and mustshow that its origins are politically explosive and sensitive, and make sensewithin a wider context.The crash of something from an independent postwar Nazi project in the NewMexico desert would seem at first glance to fill both requirements, for thecrash would represent something technologically sophisticated, something notwithin the purview of any American black project, and an origin that was —especially at that time — politically explosive and sensitive, the more sobecause of its proven record of malign intentions, and the more so because thoseintentions could conceivably exacerbate already frayed Cold War tensions betweenthe Soviet bloc and the West.A look at that wider Nazi context is now in order.image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Kevin Randle, Ph.D., Roswell Revisited (Lakeville, Minnesota: Galde Press,Inc., 2007), p. 19.2 See pp. .3 See my remarks on p. 74.4 Randle, Roswell Revisited, p. 121.5 Berliner and Friedman, Crash at Corona, “Preface to the Paperback Edition,” p.xvi.6 See for example Randle and Schmitt, UFO Crash at Roswell, p. 229.7 See http://kkkwatch.blogspot.com/ [http://kkkwatch.blogspot.com/]8 See pp, 160, 167.

Adams, Jr, Authorized Representative of the US High> Commissioner for Germany2 By July of 1947, there were abundant clues that were beginning to be piecedtogether by American intelligence that Nazism had survived not only in isolatedenclaves, but that it was an organized international force. And by themid-1950s, it was abundantly clear to the U.S. Air Force that those Nazis hadcontinued to research independently their most extraordinary projects andsciences, and that they were making deep penetrations into the most sensitiveareas of the American military-industrial-intelligence complex.Some ufologists have sought — rightly — to interpret the Roswell Incident withinthe wider ufological context of the immediate postwar period. Indeed, such amethodology is not only sound, but necessary, for if the event is to beinterpreted along extraterrestrial lines, a circumstantial case has to be madethat such an interpretation makes sense in a wider context. Similarly, someproponents of more “mundane” terrestrial explanations have sought to make a casethat their explanation of the Incident makes sense within a wider context. Assuch, any interpretation of the Incident as a crash and retrieval of somethingrepresenting the postwar independent Nazi continuation of some of their wartimesecret projects must be able to make sense in, and of, a wider context.In the case of the Nazi scenario, that wider context is inclusive of somepre-war, wartime, and postwar UFO sightings, and is also inclusive of a widerhistorical and political context, some of which involves the establishment ofthe postwar “national security state” within the United States of America, andsome of which involves top secret UFO study groups. As such, the Nazi scenarioin some instances relies upon not only a similar or parallel dataset ofsightings and documents as an extraterrestrial interpretation, but in somecases, exactly the same sightings and documents, but chooses a differentparadigm of interpretation and hence offers a different rationalization ofspecific points.As such, some might be tempted to conclude from my arguments in the forthcomingpages that I am arguing that all UFO sightings from the period in question aredue to the activities of Nazis, or that I am adhering to the Nazi interpretationof the Roswell Incident dogmatically. To maintain either such viewpoint would besimilar to maintaining that the pro-extraterrestrial proponents of the RoswellIncident are maintaining that all UFO sightings are extraterrestrial, or thatthey are maintaining their interpretation of Roswell with a dogmaticirreformability. While they are certainly passionate in their convictions andarguments, I have never concluded from their published comments that they aredogmatic about them. They, like all researchers, claim the right to be wrong,and the same caution must be exercised by the reader with the case that I nowargue here. To conclude from their passionate and strongly-worded rhetoric thatthey are dogmatic is to miss their point: they are arguing a circumstantialcase, and that it what I do here, hopefully equally as passionately.In any case, the “wider historical context” which is presented here is inclusiveof the so-called “foo fighters” reports — and the allegations that they werealways “harmless” — but more importantly, seeks to demonstrate that in thepostwar period Nazism was alive, well, and sufficiently organized and withenough financial clout so as to be able to continue its own researchindependently of any of the victorious postwar Allied powers. As will also beseen, that activity is inclusive of significant indicators that the PaperclipNazi scientists within this country continued to have and pursue their ownresearch agenda independent of their host country. That “independence” seems tohave been exercised within the wider context of a postwar detente that wasstruck between surviving Nazis and their postwar command structure on the onehand, and the financial and corporate elite of the Anglo-American world on theother. It is within this politically explosive and sensitive context that Iinterpret the Roswell Incident.When viewed in that context, the Roswell Incident reveals potentialities andimplications that perforce it cannot have under the extraterrestrialinterpretation, namely, that the Incident itself became another clue to thatAnglo-American corporate and military elite that not all was quiet on theWestern Front. It was another clue — the most significant one — that the oldenemy had survived the collapse of its German base of operations and simplytransplanted itself elsewhere, and that it would, under the terms of thatpostwar detente, continue to monitor the progress of its former enemies.There is another dialectic at work within the wider historical and ufologicalcontext that will be revealed in the forthcoming pages, and it is best toforewarn the reader of it here. That dialectic was hinted at in the epigraphsthat began this chapter, for on the one hand, while the government was atroughly the same period issuing private statements to itself that UFOsrepresented no security threat, it was also secretly attempting to shoot themdown, as we shall see. That mutually contradictory policy was oddly mirrored inits schizophrenic approach to many of the Nazi Paperclip scientists, many ofwhom were stated to be “ardent Nazis” but “no security threat to the UnitedStates.” As will be argued in the coming pages, this schizophrenia toward somePaperclip Nazis and toward some UFOs may in fact be related, and may reflect thewider policy of postwar “detente” between that surviving Nazi International andthe Anglo-American financial elite.A. THOSE “HARMLESS” FOO FIGHTERS1. SIGHTINGS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO WORLD WAR TWO AND UNUSUAL EXPLANATIONS The problem with the “foo fighters” of World War Two is that one is most likelynot dealing with a uniform phenomenon. In what is both an excellent — and theonly — study of the subject, researcher Keith Chester notes that the problemwith the phenomenon of the “foo fighter” is that the term did not originateuntil 1945, and covered a variety of discrete phenomena seen in all theaters ofthe Second World War. The problem is further compounded by the fact that thevarious phenomena were called different things in intelligence reports,depending upon what Allied pilots saw, from “balls of fire” to “meteors” or even“freaks.”3 Perhaps sensing the futility of attempting to fix a consistentdescriptor to the phenomena, Chester notes that, “All these sightings werelisted under the heading of ‘phenomena’ or ‘phenomenon’ in military intelligencemanuals.”4 And well they might be, for whatever “it” was, it came “in a varietyof shapes, sizes, and colors” and moreover in some cases “had extraordinaryflight performance capabilities, were able to travel at phenomenal speeds, andcould avoid radar detection.”5Exactly what they were, nobody knew, but the fact that they were seen in alltheaters and by pilots on both sides of the war has led some to dismiss the ideathat any of them might have represented an extraordinary terrestrial and Germantechnology. The problem with this view, as Chester ably demonstrates, is thatone is not dealing with a uniform nor consistent phenomenon; several differenttypes of phenomena may be involved, and there is every indication that indeedsome of them were in fact extraordinary German technologies.As was seen in previous pages, some Roswell researchers wish to close off anypotential usefulness of the phenomenon as an explanation of the RoswellIncident, at least, along the lines of a terrestrial German technology. Berlinerand Friedman, for example, state that “Not once was there any suggestion that afoo fighter had proved aggressive or even mildly unfriendly.”6 The argumentseems to be that since they had not “proven aggressive” the phenomena — or atleast some of them — could not have represented anything German and hence of anextraordinary terrestrial nature. In this, Berliner and Friedman echo thestatements of the CIA’s secret Robertson Panel report on UFOs, which stated thatUFOs were essentially no threat to the national security of the United Statesbecause they, like the foo fighters, had not engaged in any hostile acts againstus or our allies.7 Berliner and Friedman also note that they were seen by allsides in all theaters of the war, and hence the implication is that they had tobe someone else’s technology, just not the Germans’ nor any other humantechnology. Berliner and Friedman state, however, that famous pilot JimmyDoolittle was allegedly recruited to study the phenomena and write a report, inwhich he allegedly concluded the foo fighters represented a German or Japanesesecret technology.8So one is left with the fundamental implied argument: the foo fighters wereharmless to Allied aircraft, and hence not German, and because they were seen inall theaters of the war by military personnel on both sides of the war, theycould not represent a terrestrial and German technology, insofar as theyrepresented a technology at all. Insofar as the phenomenon is relevant toRoswell at all, it can only be in this sense of something non-terrestrial.Indeed, UFO cognoscenti could even point to several instances of similarphenomena being sighted in the years immediately prior to the Nazi assumption ofpower in Germany in 1933 and several years before World War Two even began, andhence, the “foo fighters” could hardly represent something “made in NaziGermany.”It is in this context that Chester’s research is quite a shock, for while hemakes it abundantly clear that there are sightings that could not be German noranyone else’s, he also makes it abundantly clear that there were some that wereGerman, and that there was also some behavior from “foo fighters” that wasclearly aggressive and hostile to Allied aircraft and their crews, and that manywithin Allied commands suspected not an extraterrestrial but a terrestrialorigin, and moreover, a German one.Of particular interest in this regard are the sightings in Scandinavia in 1933and early 1934, shortly after the Nazi assumption of power. These sightings areinteresting not only for the detailed descriptions given by some who saw them,but even more so for the conclusions that the Norwegian and Swedish militariesdrew from them. Chester cites a report first uncovered by British ufologistTimothy Good, that> For ten days in late December 1933, the Swedish Air Force searched in vain,> hunting for an aerial intruder operating unchallenged in northern Norway and> northern Sweden. Authorities believed the aircraft was flying out of a secret> mountain base near Westerbotten. Oddly, no weather condition was severe enough> to keep the “mysterious airplane” grounded and, on one occasion, was even> heard flying towards Norway during a snowstorm. Not only was the “mysterious> airplane” flying in weather that greatly challenged then current conventional> aircraft capabilities but it “frequently circled low, projecting powerful> searchlights on the ground.” Reports of engine noise accompanied some> sightings, while other witnesses “sometimes described low-level maneuvers in> complete silence.”9 Whatever this object or these objects was or were, apparently nothing about itor them was exotic enough to compel the Swedish military to conclude that itcame from another planet. Indeed, and very suggestively, the Swedish militaryconcluded that some secret base — and hence a secret terrestrial technology —was involved.Not content to leave matters there, however, the Swedish Air Force conductedfurther operations to determine if its conclusions were warranted:> ...(Two) Swedish airplanes carried out aerial reconnaissance. Their attempt> failed. Both planes were lost in the search, but fortunately, the crews> survived. On Christmas day, a second effort was initiated by Lt. Wanberg, who> conducted a lone scouting expedition on foot, but he never returned. In an> effort to locate him, three skiers embarked on a rescue mission. Sadly, they> too disappeared. The treacherous weather and rough terrain had proven> absolutely brutal, and as of January 9, 1934, the military failed in their> attempt to find all four men.10 After losing two aircraft and four people, the Swedish Air Force “conducted anofficial investigation” of what was now being called “the phantom fliers,”11 forthe affair was taking on sinister implications, given the clearly audibledrumbeats of war coming from the south from across the Baltic from Germany. The“phantom fliers” were apparently not only flying over sensitive Swedish militaryinstallations and conducting “reconnaissance”, but doing so in Norway as well,in a pattern that would be continued after the war.12The Scandinavian sightings continued into 1934, for on April 1, 1934 in Oslo,Norway, several witnesses described “a very large aeroplane” and onesixteen-year-old boy maintained that he had seen it in clear moonlight, and thatit had eight propellers.13 This is an interesting detail, for if true, it onceagain points to some sort of exotic experimental craft, but to somethingobviously and wholly terrestrial, and the craft’s ability to hover and maneuverat speed even in weather that would ground most aircraft of the period indicatethat whoever was flying it was in the possession of some unusually advancedtechnology for the day.But by April 30, 1934, the Swedish and Finnish air forces had given up trying tocapture one of the “phantom fliers” and their aircraft. But Norway, however,continued to investigate:> On April 30, to avoid alarm but to keep the public somewhat informed, Major> General Reutersward, commanding general of upper Norrland, told the newspapers> that authorities were entertaining the possibility that the mystery airplanes> were conducting reconnaissance exercises over very sensitive military areas.> General Reutersward further stated that, although highly reliable witnesses> made many close-up observations, “No identifying insignia or identifying marks> were visible on the machines,” and he added that “it was impossible to explain> away the whole thing as mere imagination. The question is: Who or Whom are> they, and why have they been invading our air territory?”14 What emerges from these Scandinavian sightings of 1933-1934 is a rather unusualset of data-points when one compiles them into a single list:> 1) The craft are clearly terrestrial in origin, since a witness describes> ”propellers,” an absolutely useless contrivance for interplanetary flight;> 2) The craft are clearly surveilling and reconnoitering sensitive Swedish,> Norwegian, and Finnish military installations;> 3) The clear contextual and chronological implication of the sightings, and of> these Scandinavian governments’ responses, is that they are being> reconnoitered by some secret technology from Germany, although Sweden> explicitly held open the possibility of a secret base, and presumably, some> independent source, for the phenomena. In the context of the Roswell Incident, and the wider context usually invoked byufologists to corroborate their extraterrestrial interpretation of it, theScandinavian sightings of 1933-1934 are significant, for those governments knewthey were being reconnoitered by a secret technology; they were just not readyto walk off the extraterrestrial plank, nor was the technology encounteredsufficiently exotic enough to suggest to them that they do so.2. THE SKIES OVER GERMANY AND THOSE OH-SO-HARMLESS FOO FIGHTERS But what about World War Two, and those “foo fighters” that according toBerliner and Friedman “not once” gave “any suggestion” of being “aggressive oreven mildly unfriendly”?15 While Berliner and Friedman are correct in that mostsuch encounters by Allied pilots were at best a mild nuisance, it is simply nottrue that they “not once” gave any indication of hostile intentions ormaneuvers, and even less true that no sighting ever coupled them with the GermanLuftwaffe’s activity.Indeed, while it is certainly true that “foo fighters” were sighted in alltheaters of the war by pilots on both sides of the war, it is also true that by1942 most of those sightings were concentrated over Germany and Holland.16 Thatwould seem to indicate that at least some of the varied phenomena that go underthe name “foo fighters” represent some sort of Nazi technology. That Luftwaffepilots thought some of them might represent Allied secret weapons is not reallyan argument against their Nazi origin, for such pilots in the overwhelmingmajority would not have been privy to any such secret research.One has only to look at the famous bombing raids over Schweinfurt in 1943,however, to encounter an incident where they exhibited behavior that can only beinterpreted as hostile to Allied aircraft. The Royal Air Force’s Bomber Commandand the U.S. Eighth Army Air Force had determined to obliterate the ball-bearingfactories at Schweinfurt, and thereby to cripple Germany’s war-making abilityand conceivably even considerably shorten the war. And they knew that once theiropposite numbers in Germany knew what the eventual target was, that theLuftwaffe would throw every available fighter squadron into the skies overSchweinfurt.It was in this context that one of the strangest incidents of the air war overGermany occurred, and it was first publicly reported by a well-known sciencefiction novelist during the 1960s, Martin Caidin, who also was an amateurmilitary historian and World War Two history enthusiast:> During the bomb run of several groups, starting at about the time the> Fortresses17 approached the Initial Point, there occurred one of the most> baffling incidents of World War II, and an enigma that to this day defies all> explanation.> As the bombers of the 384th Group swung into the final bomb run after passing> the Initial Point, the fighter attacks fell off. This point is vital, and> pilots were queried extensively, as were other crew members, as to the> position at that time of the German fighter planes. Every man interrogated was> firm in his statement that “at the time there were no enemy aircraft above.”18> At this moment the pilots and top turret gunners, as well as several crewmen> in the Plexiglas [sic] noses of the bombers, reported a cluster of discs in> the path of the 384ths formation and closing with the bombers. The startled> exclamations focused attention on the phenomenon, and the crews talked back> and forth, discussing and confirming the astonishing sight before them.> The discs in the cluster were agreed upon as being silver colored, about one> inch thick and three inches in diameter. They were easily seen by the B-17> crewmen, gliding down slowly in a very uniform cluster.> And then the “impossible” happened. B-17 number 026 closed rapidly with a> cluster of discs; the pilot attempted to evade an imminent collision with the> objects, but was unsuccessful in his maneuver. He reported at the intelligence> debriefing that his “right wing went directly through a cluster with> absolutely no effect on engines or plane surface.”> The intelligence officers pressed their questioning, and the pilot stated> further that one of the discs was heard to strike tail assembly of his B-17,> but that neither he nor any member of the crew had heard or witnessed an> explosion.> He further explained that about twenty feet from the discs the pilots sighted> a mess of black debris of varying sizes in clusters of three by four feet.> The SECRET report added: “Also observed two other A/C flying through silver> discs with no apparent damage.

One bomber’s “blind spot” would be covered by thedefensive fire arc of other bombers in its formation. For a bomber to break fromits position in that formation was to break the entire defensive fire box thatthe formation presented to Luftwaffe fighter pilots, and to weaken itconsiderably. Thus, when the “discs” closed with the 384th Bomb Group and forcedsome of its pilots to take evasive action and break formation, this action andbehavior can only be considered hostile to the American aircraft.And this brings us to the second point in Caidin’s account. Over and over againAmerican pilots and bomber crews reported that as they began their final bombrun (when breaking formation would additionally throw them away from the targetto be bombed), and at the very moment therefore that one would have expected themost intense attentions from Luftwaffe fighters, the Germans,uncharacteristically, held themselves back as if expecting something unusual tohappen, or as if they had been ordered to do so by their fighter commands.Clearly, then, the Allied intelligence officers’ scrutiny of this very strangeincident and the crews involved with it, is due to the fact that they suspectedthat the incident reflected the combat use and experimentation with some sort ofunusual weapon.But why the unusual fixation with something that, other than causing some pilotsto take evasive action and hence break formation, otherwise appeared to be moreor less “harmless”? One reason is that the Schweinfurt occurrence was not theonly such incident. Chester reports that another encounter only one monthearlier — September 6, 1943 — occurred over another major German industrialcenter, Stuttgart:> News of the “silver discs” spread fast. Later that day an update, “Additional> Information on the Observation of Silvery Colored Discs On Mission To> Stuttgart, 6 Sept. 1943,” was sent to 1st Bombardment Wing: “This observation> was made by two crews of the 384th Group and was the only place it was noted.> At this time from 2 to 4 FW190’s20 or ME 109’s21 and 1 JU 8822 were flying 2> to 3000 feet above and a little ahead of our formation. These E/A23 were not> seen to drop the material out. It came from above our A/C/. As to its shape,> it was a mass of material, kept a good pattern, did not dissipate as it> streamed down and fell comparatively slow. In one instance, the cluster> appeared to be about 8 ft. in length and about 4 feet wide as it streaked> down. Another observation stated it was about 75 feet long and 20 feet wide.> These dimensions in length being the size from top to bottom as it fell. The> cluster was composed of small round objects, silvery in color. In all> instances, the objects fell in the path of our A/C. Some was observed to fall> on the wing of a B-17 belonging to our group. The wing immediately started to> burn. This a/c did not return. No further information available.”24 Clearly, the Luftwaffe was deploying and combat-testing some sort of strangetechnology, and that technology was anything but harmless if it is making thewings of B-17s literally catch fire and burn!Nor is this all Chester uncovered about the unusual “silver disc ordnance.”25The Stuttgart incident had led one Allied intelligence analyst to speculate thatthe “‘silvery-colored discs’ were composed of (1) ‘white phosporous and a stickysubstance which would cause it to cling to the plane...’ and (2) ‘Thermite withsome sort of igniting compound ingredient in a sticky substance...’ or even (3)‘Flat round glass containers loaded with either of the above incendiary 26components.’”26 But there was more. According to Chester, a “follow-up reportreleased in the US Eight Air Force Weekly Digest on September 26” stated that“‘Several new aerial weapons developed by the enemy have been inspected andreported upon during recent weeks.”27 Note the report claims that some of thestrange German weapons had actually been inspected. Finally, Chester notes thatsome bomber pilots actually stated clearly and unequivocally that Germanfighters “‘were dropping pie-plates’ on them.”28British crews were no less involved in such sightings during their night-bombingruns over Germany. In one such instance over the German city of Aachen, a brightwhite light ascended from the ground after an initial zig-zag course until itreached altitude. Another British bomber crew flying over Osnabruk saw a“rocket” with a long white tail of light flying at the same altitude as theirown aircraft.Yet another British pilot reported a very strange occurrence flying in France inDecember 1942:> B.C. Lumsden was piloting his Hurricane fighter at approximately 7,000 feet.> While flying over the French coast near the mouth of the Somme River, he> noticed something suddenly climbing towards him from below. Approaching were> two lights, amber and orange colored, slowly making their way to his altitude.> At first, he assumed they were tracer-flak of some kind, but then realized> they were traveling too slowly for such ordnance. The lights had by then> reached his altitude and were maintaining a level course with his aircraft.> Lumsden watched as the lights grew larger in size and brighter in luminance.> Unable to identify what they were, Lumsden felt something was simply not right> and out of place. Concerned for his safety, he dropped his extra fuel tanks> and began evasive action, diving several thousand feet before leveling out and> accelerating up to 260 mph. In unison, the two lights descended with him,> actually dropping to a lower altitude before ascending again, and then> continued their pursuit. Lumsden noticed that the lights maintained a> relatively constant distance from each other, only varying in height at times.> He was sure they were not aircraft wingtip lights due to their flying angle.> During the episode, he noticed no enemy flak or searchlights. Able to out> distance the lights, Lumsden fled the scene.29 There are two possible explanations for the lack of a German response toLumsden’s and the mysterious lights accompanying him. The first is that theGermans were simply unaware of his or their presence, an unlikely explanationsince any aircraft flying at 7,000 feet would have been clearly visible toGerman radars along the French coast, and unlikely due to the fact that thisparticular region of the French coast was undergoing heavy fortification andconstruction by the Germans in preparation for an eventual Allied invasion. AnyAllied reconnaissance activity by single aircraft would inevitably have been metby a response from Luftwaffe night fighters.The other explanation — which this author finds to be more likely — is that theGermans had decided to test some exotic technology using the British fighter’spresence, and hence, the local German anti-aircraft crews and fighter squadronswould have been alerted by their local commands and told to stand down in thisinstance, lest their actions inadvertently damage the experimental equipmentitself. The behavior of the lights, especially their “overshooting” of Lumsden’sdive and then their climb back up to his altitude, implies a remote-controlledand perhaps ground-based technology is in play.An even more significant incident occurred on May 13 and 14, 1943 over Pilsen,Czechoslovakia. Royal Air Force crews reported an object “described as givingoff a sequence of sparks and as having a definite tail leaving a trail of smoke;it was seen to travel about ten miles before falling to the ground, where itburnt out after a minute. The crew who made this report said they had seensimilar phenomena on previous occasions in approximately the same area...”30 Thesignificance of this report lies in the fact that the technology described isexotic for the time, but clearly, something leaving a trail of smoke and givingoff sparks hardly qualifies as exotic enough to be extraterrestrial. However,more significant is the fact that this sighting occurs precisely over theheadquarters of SS Obergruppenfimage [images/00057.jpg]hrer Hans Kammler’ssecret weapons think tank inside the engineering division of the Skoda Works inPilsen, the very group responsible for much of Nazi Germany’s exotic and secretresearch into advanced aerodynes and propulsion systems!31The unusual nature of some these sightings prompted analysts at Britain’s BomberCommand to conclude that in all likelihood the Allies were dealing with anadvanced and secret Nazi technology,32 and Allied intelligence was, moreover,reluctant even to qualify them as rockets. As Chester observes:> Even Fighter Command used the word “phenomenon” in their report, revealing> there was a real hesitancy in accepting rockets as the culprit of the> sightings. Reviewing the Fighter Command report today, these anti-aircraft> rockets were well in advance of German technology at that time. The so-called> rockets displayed a propulsion system capable of a five-minute engine burn> time, and they had the ability to fly on a parallel course with allied> aircraft. This was pretty remarkable for 1942 and is highly suspect. But one> cannot entirely rule out the possibility that the Germans had been> experimenting with some pretty advanced designs at this early date.33 Indeed, it is now well-known that much of this advanced and exotic researchbegan long before the war, and, if certain reports are to be believed, evenbefore the Nazis assumed power.343. GENERAL TWINING AND ROBERTSON MAKE THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE Two important individuals also make their first appearance in Chester’sresearch, and precisely in the context of wartime Allied intelligenceinvestigation and analysis of the foo fighter phenomenon; both are well-known tothe subject of ufology in general and to Roswell Incident researchers inparticular. They are General Nathan Twining, subsequent postwar commandinggeneral of the U.S. Air Force’s Air Materiel Command, and Howard P. Robertson,postwar chairman of the CIA’s secret “Robertson Panel” on UFOs in the early1950s.On March 15, 1944, then Major General Nathan Twining issued a memorandumentitled “Capture Intelligence Interrogation of Air Prisoners of War,Examination of Enemy Equipment.” The memorandum stipulated that no prisoner wasto be interrogated by anyone of any rank that was not connected to the CSDIC or“Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Center,” which was specificallyestablished “to interrogate enemy air force prisoners and examine theirdocumentation or anything else in their...possession.”35 Twining, in otherwords, was deeply involved in intelligence and analysis of German technologyduring World War Two.Robertson’s intelligence and analysis involvement in World War Two is even moreintriguing. By 1944, with the threat of German V-1 “buzz-bombs,” the wingedbombs propelled by ramjets, and the even more sophisticated V-2 rocket, becominga reality, and with the Allied invasion of France looming, the Allies had tohave effective intelligence concerning the capabilities of these weapons, of theGerman ability to mass produce them, and of any potentially effectivecountermeasures. Major General S.G. Henry “officially established the Committeeon Counter-measures Against German Secret weapons.... A scientific and technicalgroup was set up within the committee composed of the three civilian scientists:Howard P. Robertson, A.L. Loomis, and Roger Adams.”36After the invasion of Europe, with Allied armies marching across France into theLow Countries, intelligence teams fanned out over the countryside behind them,trying to learn as much as possible from captured German research installations.The problem was, almost every service branch had its own intelligence groups,and every allied power with troops on the ground did as well. As a result ofthis confusion, General Eisenhower “established a Combined IntelligencePriorities Committee” with categories subdivided according to the type ofintelligence targets that the Allies were trying to learn about. HowardRobertson was one scientist tasked with flagging certain types of intelligencereports. As Chester correctly observed, Robertson’s V-1 and V-2 work wouldpossibly have brought him into contact with intelligence reports concerning thefoo fighter “phenomena,” and if so, he and liaisons working with him wouldlikely have flagged any such reports for special investigation.37Eishenhower’s concern for intelligence coordination was not misplaced. Indeed,as Chester notes, there appear to have been “pirate” or independent intelligencegroups operating behind Allied lines and disguised as Allied military personnel:> There was also a concern over what they called “pirate” bodies; separate and> unknown intelligence teams encountered in the field, completely unaware of one> another’s existence or mission.> The pirate bodies made it very difficult for a centralized coordination effort> and provided a perfect cover, I might add, for a secretive unconventional> aircraft investigation operating without any knowledge of their agenda by CIOS> leaders.38 The mind boggles, for in other words, what Chester is maintaining is in realitya distinct possibility, namely, that either some super-secretive group or groupswithin American and/or British intelligence realized that there was a potentialtechnological goldmine in Nazi research and determined to acquire it andwithhold it from the normal channels of military intelligence and analysis, oreven worse, such “pirate teams,” masquerading as Allied intelligence teams,might represent two further possibilities, both equally disturbing. The first isthat they represented Nazis themselves, who using such disguises and operatingbehind Allied lines, were trying to evacuate crucial technology anddocumentation and to prevent it from falling permanently into Allied hands. Thesecond is that they represented some private interest within the Alliedcountries themselves.39As for the other kind of foo fighter, the “red balls of fire” so often reportedby Allied crewmen over Nazi Germany, the overwhelming body of these reportscould never pin them to anything explicitly German......except in one instance, when the IX Tactical Air Command reported that aGerman Messerschmitt 109 fighter joined a formation of Allied aircraft and “wasseen to emit what appeared to be a red ball of fire which followed the aircraftfor some 2-3 seconds,” after which the Messerschmitt broke away.40Whatever else emerges from all of this, it is clear that Berliner and Friedmanare simply and utterly mistaken in their assessment of the foo fighter and thetechnological potential it represented, for clearly, there were rare instancesof behavior from them that could only have been interpreted as hostile by theAllies, and indeed, was so interpreted. There are contextual indications thatsome of these sightings clearly imply a Nazi technology in play, andparticularly so in the above case of the Messerschmitt 109 emitting a “ball offire.”In this context, General Twining’s selection to command the postwar Air MaterielCommand is logical on two counts. First, having had wartime intelligenceexperience dealing with foreign and hostile technology in Europe, he is alogical choice for such a command. Secondly, and more importantly, if at anytime during the postwar period and in connection with UFOs, the U.S. Air Forceever suspected it was dealing either with an extraterrestrial technology, or asurviving Nazi technology, or any potential combination of the two, then again,General Twining’s command of that department of the U.S. Air Force, and hisinvolvement in the Roswell Incident, becomes even more plausible andrationalizable, especially if the Air Force suspected at any time in itsinvestigation of that Incident or other postwar UFO incidents that it might bedealing with a Nazi technology, and therefore, with a postwar extraterritorialNazi “state” continuing to access and develop it.B. THE” PAPERCLIP DETENTE”1. THE GEHLEN-DULLES DEAL AND ITS FALLOUT As is well known by now, the United States of America brought “former” Naziscientists, researchers, and technicians to this country after the Second WorldWar.> At least sixteen hundred scientific and research specialists and thousands of> their dependents were brought to the U.S. under Operation Paperclip. Hundreds> of others arrived under two other Paperclip-related projects and went to work> for universities, defense contractors, and CIA fronts.41 The sheer size of this project was offset only by the extreme secrecy with whichit dealt with and justified the clear Nazi pasts of these scientists, and withwhich it turned a blind eye to the postwar implications of their activities both“in behalf of” and independently of their new American hosts.We may refer to this inconvenient marriage as a kind of postwar “Paperclipdetente” between the chief victorious western power, its agencies,bureaucracies, and most importantly, its hidden oligarchic rulers and elites onthe one hand, and its one-time enemy, the Nazis, on the other. As we shall nowdiscover, this “Paperclip Detente” reached out to embrace not only those Nazisformally brought to this country and at least ostensibly working for it, butalso those Nazis that remained independent, organized, and active after the war.It was a stormy marriage from the outset (and indeed, there are disturbingcontemporary signs that it is headed for a stormy divorce, with thatAnglo-American oligarchic elite being on the short end of the “settlement”). Nobetter icon of its dubious and ambiguous character exists than the secretbargain struck before the end of the war between the OSS’ Zurich station chief,and later CIA director, Allen Dulles, and the head of Nazi Germany’s militaryintelligence organization in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, GeneralReinhard Gehlen and his Fremde Heere Ost (Foreign Armies East).42The terms of this bargain were nothing less than stunning, and it is best toallow General Gehlen himself to state in his own words what they were:> I remember the terms of the agreement well...> 1. A clandestine German intelligence organization was to be set up, using the> existing potential to continue information gathering in the East just as we> had been doing before. The basis for this was our common interest in a defense> against communism.> 2. This German organization was to work not “for” or “under” the Americans,> but “jointly” with the Americans.> 3. The organization would operate exclusively under German leadership, which> would receive its directives and assignments from the Americans until a new> government was established in Germany.> 4. The organization was to be financed by the Americans with funds which were> not to be part of the occupation costs, and in return the organization would> supply all its intelligence reports to the Americans.> 5. As soon as a sovereign German government was established, the government> should decide whether the organization should continue to function or not, but> that until such time the care and control (later referred to as “the> trusteeship”) of the organization would remain in American hands.> 6. Should the organization at any time find itself in a position where the> American and German interests diverged, it was accepted that the organization> would consider the interests of Germany first.43 One almost has to read this list twice in order for the full magnitude of theimplications of the “bargain” to sink in, but nonetheless the basic implicationis clear: Nazi military intelligence basically remained organizationally intactafter the war, continued to be run by the same general that ran it during thewar, was paid for by America, and it was understood that in conflicts ofinterest, it would place German interests ahead of American interests! Indeed,Gehlen’s organization, or the “Gehlenorg” or “the Org” as it was also called,eventually became the forerunner of West Germany’s “CIA”, theBundesnachrichtendienst or BND.But the implications do not stop there. As conspiracy researcher Jim Keith putit, there is another nasty implication:> Using Nazi intelligence networks as a hole card to provide for his own> survival and the survival of his huge spy network, Gehlen made a separate> peace with Dulles, resulting in the clean grafting of Nazi spy apparatus to> the American clandestine services. This was the birth of the CIA and part of a> nexus of betrayal that continues to this day.44 In other words, one member of the American oligarchic elite — Allen Dulles — hadnegotiated a “separate peace” or to be more precise, a “detente” andcoexistence, with a member of the Nazi elite — General Gehlen.Nor do the long range implications stop even there, for as part of his“organization,” General Gehlen oversaw a vast network of “émigré” frontscomposed of exiled Lithuanians, Letts, Estonians, White Russians, Ukrainians andother eastern European nations that had been overrun by the Red Army as itadvanced on the Reich. These organizations, as we shall see below, establishedthemselves in the United States and became very influential in Republicanpolitics during the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George Herbert WalkerBush.There was other fallout to the Gehlen-Dulles version of “Paperclip Detente,” andthat was the Cold War itself. For example, the Gehlen Organization estimatedthat the Red Army had available some 175 combat-ready divisions in EasternEurope, and that “quiet changes already under way in Soviet billeting and leavepolicies for these troops suggested a major mobilization could be in thewind.”45 All this General Gehlen “dutifully” reported to the American militarycommander in occupied Germany, General Lucius Clay,46 who equally as dutifully,telegrammed Washington in early March, 1948, that war with the Soviet Union “maycome with dramatic suddenness.”47 This became the celebrated “War Scare”telegram that was used by hawks within the Pentagon such as General Curtis Lemayto argue for a vastly expanded American nuclear arsenal capable of turning theSoviet Union into a glowing radioactive cinder.But Gehlen was hardly a fool, for after years of experience in militaryintelligence matters regarding the Soviet Union, and knowing firsthand thedevastation to its infrastructure, cities, and industry that country hadsuffered at Nazi hands, he knew full well that such a massive and suddeninvasion of the West by the Soviet Union and its client states was veryunlikely. What he had cleverly done for his American handlers was todeliberately transform the political threat posed by the Soviet Union into animminent military threat, and the “Cold Warriors” in the Pentagon respondedaccordingly, initiating the Cold War nuclear arms race.48Gehlen, in other words, was deliberately overestimating Soviet capabilities andintentions in the postwar period, with the specific design of getting the UnitedStates locked into an inevitable — and bankrupting — arms race with it. Andsince it is now well-known that the predecessor to the KGB, the NKVD, was“successful” in turning many of Gehlen’s agents into double agents for theSoviet Union, the possibility looms that these agents, like all mercenaries,remained loyal to their original leadership, and Gehlen’s organization wasfeeding the Soviets similar disinformation regarding American capabilities andintentions.The purpose of all these machinations is thus immediately evident, for bylocking the two postwar “superpowers” into a stalemating arms race, moremaneuvering room is created for organizations such as Gehlen’s to act as the“balance of power” and as a hidden “third force” on the world stage. Indeed, asI have argued throughout my previous books on Nazi secret weapons and postwarsurvival and research, it appears very much that this postwar stalemate was to acertain extent orchestrated by the Nazis themselves, who saw to it that the USAand the USSR obtained roughly an equal division of the technological spoils,while the Nazis retained postwar control over and possession of research intotheir most exotic and advanced projects.49So what does one make of the Gehlen-Dulles end of the Paperclip Detente? In mybook The SS Brotherhood of the Bell I put it this way:> ...(One) whole department of the American Federal government — indeed, one of> its most sensitive departments — was being run by agents of the Third Reich in> a classic Trojan Horse operation! With the thousands of agents in Gehlen’s> “Organization,” and its extensive network of “émigré exile” groups and fronts,> historian Carl Oglesby noted taht teh Gehlenorg “substantially pre-empted the> CIA’s civilian character before it was ever born... Thus, whatever the CIA was> from the standpoint of law, it remained from the standpoint of practical> intelligence collection a front for a house of Nazi spies.”> The importance of these observations cannot be pondered too long, for as many> other researchers and commentators have noted, there appears to be a “rogue> element’ operating somewhere inside the U.S. Federal government and inside its> intelligence community.50 Gehlen’s organization provides the historical basis and context from which thatrogue element may be appreciated for what it is: an element whose outlook,agenda, methods, and aims are Fascist and National Socialist.2. THE PAPERCLIP SCIENTISTS AND SOME DISTURBING INDICATIONS But what of the Nazi scientists brought over here themselves: Did OperationPaperclip have similar implications? Did those Nazi scientists and techniciansdisplay a similar independence from and diffidence towards their American hostsas their counterparts in Gehlen’s far more independent organization?Unfortunately, the answer to both those questions is a clear and unequivocal“yes.” In its pursuit of the fruits of Nazi research and technology, Americanscientists became so “dazzled by German technology that was in some cases yearsahead of our own, they simply ignored its evil foundation — which sometimesmeant stepping over and around piles of dead bodies — and pursued Naziscientific knowledge like a forbidden fruit.”51 Indeed, it was after learning ofNazi human experimentation, and after the inception of Project Paperclip, thatAmerican doctors and scientists indulged in “Dachau-like” medicalexperimentation on American soldiers.52 In its obsession to acquire Nazisscientists and their knowledge, their Nazi pasts were often clearly spelled outon the security reviews, and in the very next breath such a past was deemed notto be a threat to the security of the United States. Shades of General Gehlen!There was wholesale sanitization of records.53 In any case, one of thosehigh-ranking American generals who oversaw Operation Paperclip — and who plays aprominent role in some ufological studies — was General Hoyt Vandenberg.54In cases where no amount of bleach, cleanser, or scrubbing could sanitizesomeone’s Nazi record, efforts were undertaken to relocate the Nazis in questionto Argentina, where they were expected to undertake the development of modernweapons for the Argentine military for hemispheric defense against communism.55Yet, at one and the same time, the American military had another secret projectcode-named “Safehaven,” which “was designed to prevent Germans from escaping toother countries, primarily in Latin America, to continue their wartimeresearch.”56 In other words, while one project of the American military istrying to help Nazis do precisely that, another project is acutely aware of thedangers that any such independent postwar Nazi research would pose, for it isadmitting the very real possibility that such an event could happen!The degree of Nazi penetration into postwar America’s defense establishment isnothing less than breathtaking, for Nazi chemical warfare experts were soonfound working for the Rockefeller Institute,57working at Wright Field in Dayton,Ohio for General Twining’s Air Materiel Command and other projects developingsupersonic aircraft designs,58 and of course Nazi medical doctors of dubiousmoral standing such as Dr. Hubertus Strughold made their way into postwarAmerica’s nascent space medicine program.59Of course, not all this happened without voices of protest and concern over thesecurity issues being raised. Under Secretary of War Robert Patterson, forexample, stated that “These men are enemies and it must be assumed that they arecapable of sabotaging our war effort.”60 Arthur Rudolph, principal designer ofthe massive Saturn V booster with its titanic 7,500,000 pounds of thrust thatwould take American astronauts to the moon, was typical of the attitude. OneAmerican counter-intelligence officer noted on Rudolph’s Paperclip securityreview form that he was “100% NAZI,” was a “dangerous type” and even a “securitythreat,” and went so far as to suggest that Rudolph be interred.61 Nonetheless,the warnings went largely ignored, at least, that is, until after the successfulcompletion of the Apollo program, when the Nazi scientists and engineers were nolonger needed for America’s ‘“home-grown “space shuttle” project! At that point,under threat from the U.S. Justice Department for indictment for war crimes,Rudolph fled the country.And in a curious incident, one Nazi physicist, Rudolph Fleischmann, “was flownto the United States for interrogation prior to the dropping of atomic bombs onJapan.”62 One wonders exactly why a Nazi physicist had to be interrogated byAmericans prior to a-bombing Japan if the Nazi atom bomb project was asunsuccessful and subject to conceptual errors as the postwar Allied Legend makesit out to be!But all of this — all of it — pales into insignificance when one compares it tothe activities and actions of the German rocket scientists brought to Fort Blissin El Paso, Texas, and who subsequently conducted V-2 test launches over thedeserts of New Mexico, for when one considers these activities, one isconfronted with clear indications that “our” Nazis may not really nor ultimatelyhave been “ours” after all.The first clue that “our” Nazis were a very independent group occurred duringthe test-firing of one of the captured German V-2 rockets in New Mexico. Sinceat that time our own Army Air Force had little to no experience with theclearing routines for launching such a -for that time — large rocket, the entireclearing routing and launch procedure was handled by the Nazi rocket scientistsand technicians. Supervising the launch was a top rocket scientist of VonBraun’s Peenemimage [images/00057.jpg]nde rocket team, Ernst Steinhoff. Variousmonitoring teams of Germans were stationed at various points around the launcharea to monitor the track of the rocket with high powered telescopes and toreport back to the central blockhouse, where Steinhoff had positioned himself,ready to abort the launch and blow up the rocket in mid-air if something shouldgo wrong.What happened next has gone down in history as a classic international incident.Shortly after launch, the V-2> began to go astray, reverse course, and head straight south toward El Paso.> Steinhoff knew the rocket was headed in the wrong direction but let it fly. It> soared over El Paso, over the Mexican border, and finally crash-landed about> three miles from a heavily populated Juarez business district. Mexican> residents nearby fled in terror as the rocket exploded, leaving a huge crater> 50 feet wide and 24 feet deep as it burrowed into the ground. The next day,> red-faced officials in Washington had to explain to the Mexican government why> the United States had launched a missile attack on their country.63 Steinhoff’s attitude, however, in not aborting the launch but allowing it tocontinue on its wayward course towards the heavily populated civilian areas ofEl Paso and Juarez, Mexico, raise the possibility that the rocket’s strayingfrom course may not have been an accident at all, but part of some largerdeliberate pattern.Indeed, FBI and Army counter-intelligence regarded that area of northern Mexico“as ripe for a potential unhampered operation of foreign agents orsympathizers.”64 One U.S. counter-intelligence agent observed that former Naziagents in that country had almost unlimited freedom of movement in Mexico. Whilethe agent’s concern was that northern Mexico was a base of operation for Russianintelligence against America’s guided missile project,65 the same could be saidfor any potential independent Nazi organization.And such appears to actually have been the case, for one armycounter-intelligence agent complained that the Nazi scientists, based at FortBliss in El Paso — the same Fort Bliss as was commanded by the General Montaguementioned in the Eisenhower Briefing Document as a member of the allegedsuper-secret Majestic-12 UFO study group — were under virtually no surveillanceby U.S. Army counter-intelligence, nor was any attempt made “to place them inanything resembling custody.”66It gets worse, for prior to the rocket scientists’ arrival in the U.S.A., theU.S. Army uncovered enough information to suggest that there was “a conspiracyamong von Braun, (General Walter) Dornberger, and Dornberger’s former chief ofstaff, Herbert Axster, to withhold information from U.S. officers.” To givesecurity clearances to such a group was, for this officer, “an obviousabsurdity.”67 Nor does it stop there, for four months after “our” Nazi rocketscientists had signed their contracts to continue their wartime research for theU.S. Army, all surveillance of the Nazi scientists ceased entirely. Nor were thelarge amounts of their dependents — “including mistresses and maids” — eversurveilled when they went off the base at Fort Bliss,68 and of course, thatmeant they could easily slip back and forth across the border into northernMexico, the very focus of concerns for some American counter-intelligenceofficers who worried about it functioning as a base of espionage operationsagainst the United States!As if all this were not enough, one U.S. Army officer, Colonel Frank Reed, hadjust returned from a visit to St. Louis, France, “where a comparable group ofGerman rocket engineers worked for the French government. While there, theFrench commandant told Reed he suspected the Germans under French control werereceiving orders from Germany and working toward a reemergence of the ThirdReich.”69 Nor was this beyond the bounds of possibility, for the top Naziscientists in this country kept open independent lines of communicationoversees. Von Braun himself, for example, managed to smuggle a map out of theUSA to family members in western occupied Germany showing the location of ahidden cache of documents, which he instructed his family to turn over toGeneral Dornberger’s wife, so that the general could use them “as a bargaininglever with U.S. officials.”70The pattern of independent behavior detected by the French commandant of Germanrocket scientists in France was soon paralleled by an odd pattern of behaviorand incidents in the U.S.A., for it was eventually discovered that three of theNazi scientists> had illegal mail drops in El Paso where they received money from foreign or> unknown sources and coded messages from South America. One German received> $1,000 in cash from Chile. Another specialist not only maintained an illegal> postal box but deposited $953 in his bank account in one month, even though> his monthly salary was only $290. Neither Army (counterintelligence) nor FBI> agents knew where that money came from, and by all appearances, no one cared> to know how more than a third of the Paperclip group suddenly were able to buy> expensive cars.> Other incidents proved that security was a sham. Unsupervised German> scientists with no visas illegally cross the border into Mexico for a little> cheap wine, women, and song. Other specialists made frequent trips from White> Sands to the El Paso home of a German-born woman who was under FBI> investigation and described by her neighbors as being so pro-Hitler during the> war that local residents told her to “shut up or get out” of America.71Argentina was, of course, the postwar headquarters to a large compound of Nazisnear the southwestern Argentine town of San Carlos de Bariloche, and was an areain which Argentine security agents had repeatedly tracked the comings and goingsof none other than Nazi Party Leader Martin Bormann.72 Prior to the end of thewar, the Nazis had turned over control of their vast radio transmitter network —the Bolivar network — throughout Latin America to their Argentine hosts. Such anetwork would have allowed any postwar Nazi organization to get messages to, andfrom, their comrades in New Mexico. And Chile, of course, was such a hotbed ofpostwar Nazi activity that it eventually became the home to the notorious NaziCologna Dignidad, which was instrumental in the overthrow of Marxist SalvadoreAllende’s government in that country in the early 1970s.This postwar Nazi organization was awash with cash and other convertible assets,so it takes little imagination to see where these Paperclip Nazi rocketscientists were getting their money. The only question is, In return for what?The answer to that question may be provided by other curious “launch failures”of V-2 rockets over New Mexico, for compounding all the security problems thatthe Paperclip Nazis posed, there was another one:> (Base) security officers began to suspect that the rockets were being> sabotaged, a suspicion that increased sharply after the Juarez incident. In> one month, three out of four rockets fired at (the White Sands Proving Ground)> overshot the 90-mile-wide base and landed off course near heavily populated> areas in New Mexico and Juarez. One landed four and a half miles south of> Alamogordo, another crashed only two miles from Las Cruces, and the third> ended up in Juarez. In addition to unanswered questions about what caused the> erratic flights, five cameras attached to one of the rockets were missing> after the launch and parts from another missile that was launched never were> found.73 In other words, the Juarez Incident itself, along with all these others, mayhave been the result, not of an accident or faulty equipment, but of deliberatedesign, and since the Nazi scientists and technicians themselves had virtuallytotal control over the launch preparations and clearing routines for theserockets at that time, the conclusion seems unavoidable that they were acting fora “secret agenda” for their hidden overseas Nazi masters. And since at least oneof these incidents involved cameras that were never recovered — cameras thatperhaps busily clicked pictures over America’s most sensitive defenseinstallations at that time — it is possible that “our” Nazis were carrying outsome intelligence function for their masters, who could only be other Nazis, forremember, the Paperclip Nazi contingent — “our” Nazis — were almost to a man notonly ardently Nazi, but ardently anti-Communist, and could therefore hardly besuspected of spying for the Soviet Union.There is consequently another implication to these potential Paperclip Naziactivities in New Mexico that raises the specter of an ugly possibility, forclearly their activities — their secret sources of funding, their mail drops,the “sabotaged” rocket launches that “mysteriously” land in Mexico, the missingcameras — imply that already within America’s nascent space program there aretwo agendas at work: the American military’s, and a deeper, more secret, Nazione. There are already present in nascent form two space programs.Indeed, the two space programs hypothesis was born out by the amazing fidelityby which the Nazi Paperclip scientists were able to mirror within the laterNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) almost exactly their rolesand duties in Hitler’s Third Reich and their rocket program at Peenemimage[images/00057.jpg]nde in Germany:> The organization the Germans established at Marshall was almost an exact copy> of the Peenemimage [images/00057.jpg]nde organization. “It had proved very> efficient,” said von Tiesenhausen. But it also meant that the Germans> dominated the rocket program to such an extent that they held the chief and> deputy slots of every major division and laboratory. And their positions at> Marshall and the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida, were similar> to those they had held during the war. > • The Peenemimage [images/00057.jpg]nde team’s leader, Wernher von Braun,> became the first director of the Marshall Space Flight Center.> • Mittelwerk’s head of production, Arthur Rudolph, was named project director> of the Saturn V rocket program.> • Peenemimage [images/00057.jpg]nde’s V-2 flight test director, Kurt Debus,> was the first director of the Kennedy Space Center.74 In fact, as we shall see in a subsequent chapter, the presence of the last man,Dr. Kurt Debus, in the very same capacity in the American program as he occupiedin the Nazi one, is a significant indicator that the two space programs, apublic one commanding rockets, and a secret one with a much more advancedtechnology, that were begun in Nazi Germany continued in the American one.And the pattern of Nazi independence and pursuit of their own agenda, firsthinted at in New Mexico with the curious “failures” of V-2 launches and thephenomenon of “missing pieces and cameras,” also continued long afterward, forthe second administrator of NASA during the seminal Mercury, Gemini, and Apolloyears, James Webb, “complained that the Germans were circumventing the system byattempting to build the Saturn V in-house at the center.”75But there is one final clue that suggests one might be dealing with a Naziagenda and organization whose dimensions and goals are truly staggering. In mybook The SS Brotherhood of the Bell I outlined the conclusion of Britishresearchers David Percy and Mary Bennett that when the launch schedules forSoviet and American unmanned lunar probes from the late 1950s and early 1960s islaid out side by side and compared, that it appears that there was somecollusion taking place between the two ostensibly opposed and rival programs.76I also noted that if their observation was true, it would require someorganizational presence on the ground both in the United States and in theSoviet Union in order to coordinate such a secret agenda, and the only suchorganization with an on-the-ground presence and penetration into both countrieswas precisely General Gehlen’s “organization.”77But there is one final, potentially significant clue that with the whole subjectof the Project Paperclip Nazis one has to do with double-dealing on a massivescale, and it is a little known fact regarding one of the project heads ofOperation Paperclip during 1959 and 1960: Colonel William Henry Whalen. Whalenwas convicted in the 1960s of espionage....for the Soviet Union. In other words,one of the American officers running the Paperclip project during that time wasa double agent for the Soviet Union!78 In this capacity, Whalen would have hadsome contact with the top Nazi scientists within NASA, or at least have had easyaccess to them and their files, and hence possibly have had easy access toNASA’s mission plans. Of course, as suggested before, double agents ostensiblyfunctioning within Gehlen’s organization for the Soviet Union can just as easilybe triple agents, functioning ultimately for an independent postwar NaziInternational, an extraterritorial Nazi state. Was Whalen such a triple agent?We will never know, for if he was, the American government would hardly try andconvict him on those grounds, and thereby acknowledge the existence of such anorganization.C. THE NAZI INTERNATIONAL, AND THE LEGACY OF “PAPERCLIP DETENTE”1. THE INITIAL PURPOSE OF THE EARLY BILDERBERG MEETINGS But was there such a postwar independent extraterritorial Nazi state, a “NaziInternational”? Having written an entire book with exactly that theme, andexactly that title, I of course believe the answer to that question to be anunequivocal “yes,” and a short review of my reasons for maintaining thisorganization exists are in order here.One of the major and often overlooked clues that there is a postwar “detente” inplace between elements of the Anglo-American elite and the Nazi International isthe early Bilderberger Group itself. As most people know, the Bilderberger Groupwas the brain child of members of the Rockefeller and Rothschild dynasties onthe one hand, and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands on the other. Thesemeetings of the North American and European elites began in 1954, and took theirname from the hotel in which the first meeting was held, the Bilderberg Hotel inOsterbeek, Holland.But Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands represented more than just a member ofthe European nobility, and something more than just a major stockholder in RoyalDutch Shell. He was also an SS officer, and a senior manager for the vast,vastly powerful, and notorious German chemicals cartel, I.G. Farben. And theNazi financial and corporate interests that he represented in those capacitieswere awash with a tremendous amount of cash that needed not only to belaundered, but to be safely out of reach of the prying eyes of American andBritish treasury agents intent upon shutting the postwar Nazi International downby seizing its ill-gotten booty. And the ones that could launder such vastamounts of money, and who stood to profit by having it on deposit in their banksand thus being able to expand their ledger credit entry making ability, were theinternational bankers in London and New York. It was inevitable, then, that thetwo groups whose essential political and economic philosophy (corporatefascism), and whose political aims (global domination), were one and the sameshould get together in a detente and make common cause for a period.Inasmuch as Martin Bormann had the expressed and stated postwar goal of thecreation of a “European Federation” that Germany would be able to dominate by“elastic political means,”79 and inasmuch as the Anglo-American internationalbankers had much the same goal, the use of Nazi money to revitalize postwarEurope — carefully laundered through those very banks — the detente was aninevitability.There is just one more consideration, however, that must be borne in mind. Whenthose oligarchs from the Anglo-American corporate elite entered into thisbargain, they, like Allen Dulles, were entering a bargain with an organizationwhose intentions and actions would always remain independent of them, andultimately work to overthrow them. With Bormann, they were dealing with acriminal “godfather” who would make Mario Puzo’s Don Corleone look like a gentlekitten by comparison. All that Nazi plunder and loot made available to themwould come with some very high price tags, and eventually those markers wouldcome due, and the organization existed to quite literally take those elitistsout — permanently — should they be unwilling or unable to pay up when the timecame. Moreover, that Nazi International was willing and able to continue toresearching the radical technologies that would be able to force compliance ifand when the need ever arose to do so.The dynamic of the “Paperclip Detente” thus contains its own implicit agenda,for those oligarchs would inevitably have to see to it that that race was notwon by their erstwhile Nazi partners. For both factions, it was a marriage ofinconvenience, one that both parties knew would inevitably end in a divorce, asone or the other won that technological race. It is an inevitable consequence ofthis dynamic, therefore, that anything touching upon the development of suchtechnologies would be seen by the home countries of that Anglo-American elite ashaving national security implications.2. “READ MY LIPS: NO NEW NAZIS” As indicated in the previous discussion about the bargain struck between NaziGeneral Reinhard Gehlen and the American oligarch Allen Dulles, Gehlen’sorganization commanded a vast network of “émigré fronts” of eastern Europeannationals whose homelands had been occupied by the Soviet Union. It was throughthose organizations that the Nazi International, via Gehlen’s spy organization,managed to exercise a great deal of hidden influence over American politics.These exile and “expellee” organizations not only were found to be present onthe peripheries of the assassination of President Kennedy — one need only thinkof Oswald’s association with George De Morhenschildt and the White Russiancommunity in Dallas — but they played an important and influential role inRepublican politics during the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W.Bush, even making significant financial contributions to the latter during his1988 presidential bid. They were, moreover, signally influential in PresidentRonald Reagan’s controversial visit to the Bitburg cemetery in Germany, whereseveral Waffen SS soldiers are buried. To put it succinctly, Gehlen’sorganization of “émigré fronts” of Fascists and Nazis was alive, well,organized, and politically powerful long after the general’s and Bormann’sdeaths, and this means that the Nazi International continued to function as acohesive and influential organization maintaining its original unreconstructedagenda.803. RICHTER’S “FUSION” PROJECT AT HUEMUL That this Nazi International was also capable of pursuing its most advancedresearch projects independently of any of the Allied powers after the war isably demonstrated by the so-called “controlled fusion” project of Nazi scientistRonald Richter on Huemul Island near San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina.81 Itwas Richter’s opinion that quasi-fusion or full-fledged fusion processes takingplace in a rotating plasma under conditions of extreme electrical stress were apotential gateway technology to be able to tap into and transduce the zero pointenergy. This opinion, of course, flew in the face of the standard models ofthermonuclear fusion at that day (or even today). However, the United States AirForce took Richter’s work seriously enough that it quietly investigated him fouryears after his project was shut down in 1952. One American scientistcharacterized him as a “mad genius working in the 1970s,” so a closer, thoughcertainly not extensive, look at his project is in order.It is when one looks closely at Richter that one discovers numerous ties to NaziGermany’s most highly classified and radically advanced secret weapons researchproject, the Bell. As I have detailed in previous books,82 the Bell wasclassified uniquely within the Third Reich, and higher than its atom bombproject, which I believe, contrary to all public histories, to have beensuccessful.83 The Bell was a gateway technology, a hyper-dimensionaltorsion-based technology that the Nazis had developed to investigate itspotential applications in three areas:> 1) As a means to tap into the zero-point energy, or, to phrase it differently,> the energy of the physical medium of space-time itself;> 2) As a means to manipulate gravity itself, i.e., as an advanced prototypical> field propulsion technology; and,> 3) As a means to the ultimate, potentially planet-busting, weapon. The conceptual key to the achievement of all these effects was the manipulationof rotating magnetic fields by means of the counter-rotation of a plasma withinthe device itself.Very obviously, Richter’s opinions about rotating plasma connect conceptuallyand very directly to the Bell device. But the connections are more than justcircumstantial. During 1943, Richter worked for the Allgemeine ElektricitätsGesellschaft in Nazi Germany on a highly classified project code-named“Charite-Anlage,” the exact code-name for the powerplant of the Bell device, anda project that connects him very directly to a Paperclip scientist in America,as we shall see in a subsequent chapter. Finally, all of Richter’s equipment inArgentina was supplied by the very same company! And in a final bit of highirony that can hardly be coincidental, at the very time that Richter wasconducting his secret research ostensibly for Perón’s government in Argentina,Martin Bormann was in the exact same area according to Argentine intelligence!When Juan Perón disclosed the existence of the project to the world in 1951,Richter was, of course, roundly denounced by the world scientific establishmentfor countenancing ideas that were entirely outside the standard models ofquantum mechanics and thermonuclear fusion. At that juncture, Perón becamesuspicious of his own project, and ordered Argentine nuclear physicists toinvestigate it and report their results personally to him. During thisinvestigation, however, Richter’s behavior was so eccentric and incompetent infront of the Argentine investigative commission that they concluded the man wasa complete fraud, and recommended to Perón that the project be shut down.However, Richter’s behavior was so obviously incompetent that it is evident thathe was acting under orders from the project’s real masters — Argentina’s Nazis —to deliberately discredit it in the public eye so that they could shut it downand move it elsewhere before the Allied powers caught on to what was going on inArgentina. By the time of the mid-1950s, when the U.S. Air Force finally figuredout that there was something beyond mere incompetence and fraud in Richter’sproject, the project itself had long vanished and been transferred elsewhere.In short, every indication is that the Nazis, independently, and using Argentinamerely as a base of secret operations and research, were continuing to researchand advance their most highly classified project from the war, the Bell, andwere thus pursuing all three avenues of its application: “free” energy, fieldpropulsion, and the ultimate doomsday weapon.Is it conceivable that there could be a secret ongoing Nazi research projectinto advanced field propulsion concepts and from secret Nazi bases in LatinAmerica, unknown to the victorious postwar Allied powers?The answer that the Richter-Huemul “fusion” project clearly implies is aresounding “yes.”4. CORSO’S UNUSUAL STATEMENTS AND THE BELL All of this places the much-maligned Colonel Corso and some of the remarks inhis book into rather a different perspective. Corso, who admitted he was noscientist or engineer, nevertheless made a short, and in this author’s opinion,remarkable series of statements about the means whereby he alleged the Roswellcraft actually “flew”:> The craft was able to displace gravity through the propagation of magnetic> wave (sic), controlled by shifting the magnetic poles around the craft so as> to control, or vector, not a propulsion system but the repulsion force of like> charges. Once they realized this, engineers at our country’s primary defense> contractors raced among themselves to figure out how the craft could retain> its electric capacity and how the pilots who navigated it could live within> the energy field of a wave.84 What is remarkable about this is that one of the principal Nazi scientistsinvolved with the Bell project, and who made his way to this country under theauspices of Project Paperclip, is reputed to be the very scientist who, alongwith Richter, proposed the concept of “magnetic fields separation” as a means ofcreating a coupling effect between magnetism and gravity via magnetic waves.Additionally, since the Bell’s operative principle was precisely thecounter-rotation of a plasma to achieve these effects, if this counter-rotationoccurred with difference between the two rotations (or a “differentialrotation”), it might be possible by this means to vector or direct the repulsiveforces generated. Finally, as I noted in The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, thePolish researcher who first uncovered the Bell story, Igor Witkowski, disclosedthe fact that during its first test, the Bell killed seven German scientists.Learning how to limit the effects of the field of the device quickly became amajor concern to the German Bell scientists, for obviously, if it was ever tofunction as more than a prototype or gateway technology and function as apractical field propulsion technology, learning to limit these deadly effectswas a priority.85Succinctly stated, Corso is once again pointing extraordinarily subtle fingersin the direction, not of extraterrestrials, but in the direction of Nazis, forthe physics concepts implied in both are eerily similar. Indeed, when Corso’sbook was published in the late 1990s, Witkowski’s early Bell research hadalready appeared in Poland. That Corso is letting something out of the bag isalso further suggested by the fact that he was involved in Operation Paperclip,and most likely would have encountered the Nazi Bell scientist brought into thiscountry and stationed at Fort Bliss under its auspices: Dr. Kurt Debus.D. “SHOOT THEM DOWN”: UFOS, AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY STATE The final general context with which one must contend is the overall phenomenonof UFOs in the immediate postwar period, and particularly in the United States.In this respect there are two interesting facts with which one must contend: (1)the repeated and very curious emphasis on the speed of these UFOs, which is farbelow anything practical for interplanetary, much less inter-stellar, travel inmost cases; and (2) the equally curious U.S. Air Force policy during this timeperiod of attempting to intercept and shoot these UFOs down if they failed torespond to orders to land peacefully.1. THE GENERAL PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF UFOS IN THE PERIOD One does not have to read very long nor very far in press reportage of UFOsightings in the postwar period to quickly discover an amazing thing: thereported performance characteristics of the objects — whatever they were — werefar too low to be practical for any travel between planets in our own solarsystem, much less for travel between solar systems. The point is not a trivialone, for by that point in history, with unmanned space probes to the planetsjust a decade or so away, and with telescopic studies of the planets wellunderway, it was becoming increasingly obvious to scientists that our nearbycelestial neighbors were very unlikely homes for intelligent life, and thus, ifthe UFOs were extraterrestrial, they most likely had to come from outside thesolar system.However, to give but a very short catalogue of the performance characteristicsrecorded for these objects in the immediate postwar years, it becomesimmediately evident that in all but a very few cases these characteristics areinsufficient for any practical interplanetary travel:> 1) In the very first modern postwar UFO sighting in the United States, the now> famous sighting by civilian pilot Kenneth Arnold over Yakima, Washington,> Arnold estimated the speed of the objects to be approximately 1,200 miles per> hour. This 1,200 miles per hour figure was to become, curiously, a mainstay in> many UFO reports from that era;> 2) The 1,200 miles per hour figure was repeated in an Associated Press wire> story that was picked up by the July 4, 1947 New York Times, which stated that> the U.S. Army Air Force had dropped a study of UFOs that were travelling at> approximately that speed;> 3) Again, on July 7, 1947, as the Roswell Incident was just beginning to occur> with Mac Brazel’s trip to Roswell to show the debris to Sheriff Wilcox and> Major Jesse Marcel, the New York Times ran another Associated Press article> entitled “Military Planes Hunt Sky Discs With Cameras in Vain on Coast,” in> which an Air Force officer, Captain Tom Brown, stated “There is something to> this. But we do not believe anyone in this country, or outside of this country> has developed a guided missile to go 1,200 m.p.h.!” Of course, this was in a> way pure dissembling, for the German V-2 was capable of similar speeds, and> more importantly, German ramjet proponent Dr. Walter Lippisch had designed a> delta-winged aircraft, the P-13, which reportedly was test flown shortly> before the end of the Second World War at approximately that speed!86 Lippisch> was one of the Paperclip scientists brought to Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio;> 4) On April 8, 1950, even the renowned CBS broadcast journalist Ed Murrow got> in on the act with a one half hour special documentary on UFOs, in which> Murrow reported that the typical UFO was cigar shaped with a reported speed of> between 1,200 and 1,500 miles per hour;> 5) Other reports from the era reported speeds far below these, sometimes of> only 80 to 100 miles per hour as the objects “hovered” at speeds that would> stall an ordinary aircraft lifting body. On March 21, 1950, for example, the> Los Angeles Daily News ran an article datelined Memphis, Tennessee, entitled> “See ‘saucer’ with windows on bottom,” in which a pilot for an airline> reported seeing a UFO traveling between 500 and 600 miles per hour;> 6) On March 18, 1950, the Los Angeles Mirror ran an article entitled “Now What> Was It You Saucer?” datelined Farmington, New Mexico, in which a UFO was> reported to be travelling at approximately 1,000 miles per hour;> 7) Significantly, the July 4, 1947 New York Times ran an article datelined> Washington, in which it stated that “Wright Field (Dayton, Ohio) public> relations officials said the Air Materiel Command is making an investigation> of ‘saucer-shaped’ missiles seen recently in the Pacific Northwest and Texas,”> clearly indicating thereby, and at the very time the Roswell Incident was> about to unfold, that General Nathan Twining’s Air Materiel Command was> already investigating the phenomenon, and thus making it even that much more> likely that Twining’s sudden schedule change to New Mexico in the immediate> aftermath of the Roswell Incident was for the express and covert purpose of> taking control of investigating whatever had crashed there;> 8) In yet another July 7, 1947 New York Times article, “Sky Discs Hunted by> Coast Planes,” again published during the very time that the Roswell Incident> was about to burst upon the world, the speeds of UFOs were said to be between> a less-than-breathtaking 300 miles per hour and the by now familiar 1,200> miles per hour;> 9) On July 11, 1947, after the Roswell Incident had exploded on the world> stage only to be explained away just as quickly as a “weather balloon” by> General Roger Ramey at his press conference in Fort Worth, the New York Times> reversed its earlier “objective” reporting of UFOs by an article entitled> “Yes, Disks Fly On, But Interest Lags,” in which the magical figure of 1,200> miles per hour appeared yet again, but this time in conjunction with a purely> terrestrial technology being tested by Westinghouse Research Laboratories;> 10) Finally, two articles carried by the Los Angeles Daily News entitled> “Truman, top brass scoff at wild flying saucer rumors” and “Man chased by> ‘flying saucer’ showering sparks” that ran on January 4, 1950 and April 25,> 1950 respectively, reported incidents — and technologies — curiously and> suggestively reminiscent of wartime foo fighter reports over Germany. The> first article stated that a reporter for the magazine US News and World> Report, Henry J. Taylor, maintained on an ABC broadcast that “there are two> types of ‘flying saucers’ which the military has classified as secret. One, he> said, is a harmless, pilotless disc which usually disintegrates in the air.> Its purpose, he said, is a top military secret.” The other was a top secret> aircraft being developed by the U.S. Navy at its test center at Patuxent,> Maryland. The resemblances of a “harmless pilotless exploding disc” to the> wartime reports of similar such discs over Nazi Germany is clearly evident.> The second article equally invokes a comparison to the wartime foo fighters,> for a 28-year-old man in Lufkin, Texas reported being showered with sparks> from a flying saucer. One could go on and on with such citations, but the point is clear, for the mainperformance characteristics of most of these sightings from that era are simplyinsufficient to warrant the conclusion that these objects, as a class, were ofextraterrestrial origin. Indeed, in a few cases the resemblance to wartime foofighter reports is all too palpable, and in one case there is an allegation thatthe U.S. military was continuing its development.There are two staple counter-arguments to this conclusion, and they are that 1)while the performance characteristics may be insufficient to warrant anextraterrestrial conclusion of their origins, those characteristics may notrepresent the optimal performance of the objects, and 2) the objects areself-evidently too small to be of practical utility for long-range travel, andmay therefore come from some “mothership” more suited for the purpose. However,both are arguments from silence.This leaves us with three remaining logical possibilities:> 1) the objects come from nearby local celestial space, unlikely given the> previously stated difficulties of local planetary bodies being capable of> sustaining populations of intelligent life; or,> 2) the `itself, and may represent some unknown subterranean or oceanic> sub-surface civilization;87 or,> 3) the objects come from the Earth itself, and represent some advanced and> terrestrial technology developed in great secrecy. And within the historical record, as is by now evident, the only nation thatclearly showed an interest in developing such advanced field propulsiontechnologies, and that moreover achieved in its Bell project a measure ofsuccess in that regard, was Nazi Germany. The only country with a proveninterest in the development of advanced aerodynes with potentially supersoniccapabilities, and that may actually have test flown such vehicles prior to thewar’s end, was Nazi Germany.2. SHOOT THEM DOWN! This brings us at last to the final context, the U.S. Air Force’s curious “shootdown” policy of the early 1950s. In a remarkably well-researched, tightlyargued, and well-documented study, one moreover that makes a compelling case foran extraterrestrial interpretation of the UFO flap of 1952 over the UnitedStates in general and the famous Washington, D.C. sightings of that year inparticular, ufologist Frank Feschino presents case after case of attemptedintercepts by the U.S. Air Force which was attempting to force the UFOs to landat American military bases, or, failing that, to shoot them down. Central to hisbook is the famous Flatwoods, West Virginia case where a UFO was encountered bycivilians on land, who also saw and described strange and less-than-humansounding occupants. Feschino also makes a clear and compelling case that some ofthese UFOs were clearly in the company of a “mothership.”But our focus is on the curious implications of the Air Force’s “shoot down”policy itself. Feschino reports that a wire story recorded by the InternationalNews Service from Washington, D.C., and carried by a few papers around thecountry, stated that an Air Force information officer, Lt. Colonel Moncel Monts,said that “The jet pilots are, and have been under orders to investigateunidentified objects and to shoot them down if they can’t talk them down.”88 Inresponse to this, Feschino observes that the well-known ufologist of that era,Donald Keyhoe, mentioned that Robert Farnsworth, the president of the UnitedStates Rocket Society, sent a telegram to “President Truman, Secretary ofDefense Robert Lovett, Army Secretary Frank Pace, Jr., and Navy Secretary, DanKimball,” and that Farnsworth had given a copy to the United press Internationalwire service, which is how Keyhoe apparently learned of it.89 According toFeschino, the telegram contained the following points:> 1.) “Urgently request reconsideration by your order to destroy flying> saucers.”> 2.) “Remarkably advanced aerodynamics indicate probably intercelestial (sic)> origin. Interference without more cause, than saucers friendly curiosity could> cause unbelievable suffering and death.”> 3.) “ I respectfully suggest that no offensive action be taken against the> objects reported as unidentified which have been sighted over our nation.”> 4.) “Should they be extra-terrestrial, such action might result in the gravest> consequences, as well as alienating us from beings of far superior powers.> Friendly contact should be sought as long as possible.”> 5.) People much aroused and worried.”90 Farnsworth’s telegram, in other words, is arguing that since there was apotential that the technology evidenced in the UFOs was extraterrestrial, thatTruman’s “shoot down” order was endangering the United States by risking an openwar with beings and a civilization potentially far in advance of our own.That, indeed, is a true analysis and assessment.Therewith is the problem, for as has been seen, in spite of their remarkablecharacteristics, the majority of UFO reports from that era simply do notevidence a physics or technology to be, as Farnsworth’s telegram stated,“intercelestial” or extraterrestrial. This fact would have been evident toTruman’s scientific and military advisors as well, thus making it in my opinionunlikely that either President Truman or the military would have risked an“interplanetary war” since they had already concluded some objects were notextraterrestrial in origin. While it might be argued that Earth’s major powercould not appear militarily weak to any potential extraterrestrial invader, sucha policy would have quickly revealed our gross technological inferiority to thatinvader.However, if Truman and his advisors had examined the performance characteristicsof the objects carefully and considered their implications, they are likely tohave reached similar conclusions as those advanced above, namely, that they werean advanced technology, to be sure, but a terrestrial one.Additionally, if at any point the U.S. Air Force ever suspected that some ofthese UFOs actually represented the product on ongoing independent Naziresearch, the motivations for Truman’s shoot down order become even morecompelling, and for two reasons: first, the U.S. government could hardly riskthe political embarrassment and exposure that any civilian knowledge orencounter with such technologies might bring. After all, the “Paperclip Detente”with all its secret intelligence and financial deals, was in place, and could beirreparably damaged by ch exposure and the questions it would inevitably prompt.But more importantly, even if only a minority of craft flying around theAmerican skies in those turbulent postwar years were thought or suspected to besomething Nazi, that fact alone would indicate to the American government thattheir presence was hostile, and that there technology, while advanced, was notsufficiently threatening at that juncture as to invite overwhelming retaliation.Succinctly stated, Truman’s “shoot down” order makes the most rational senseonly in a context that suggests that he and his advisors knew more about theorigins of the objects than they were letting on publicly, and that they knewthem to be terrestrial.E. CONCLUSIONS So what may be concluded from this survey of the “wider context”? First andforemost, while the vast majority of World War Two foo fighter reports do indeedsuggest the phenomenon was relatively harmless to Allied aircraft and theircrews, there are enough indications that it represented a weapons technologycapable of inflicting harm, and there are also enough indications that thattechnology emanated from Nazi Germany. It is thus simply untrue to maintain thatthere were no instances of them ever doing harm to Allied aircraft or crews, andit is equally foolish to dismiss the ramifications and implications of thattechnology for the UFO phenomenon in the postwar period in general, and for theRoswell Incident in particular.Secondly, the postwar Nazi penetration into sensitive areas of the Americanmilitary-industrial-intelligence complex was both in depth and in breadth, and“our” Nazis showed disturbing signs of independence from their new masters, evenso far as to conduct clandestine operations against them via the V-2 launchesthey were ostensibly conducting for them.Thirdly, that postwar Nazi organization survived as more than just a fewisolated enclaves in Latin America, for as the case of Ronald Richter’s “fusion”project in Argentina evidences, it was well-organized and able to fund andconduct continuing research into the physics principles embodied in its mostsensitive and highly classified wartime research project. This implies that itcould also, just as easily, have continued its other wartime research projectsinto less-advanced, but nevertheless still very exotic, aerodynes and “saucers.”Finally, via whatever intelligence it may have been receiving from “our” Nazisin New Mexico and elsewhere in the country, that organization, if in possessionof those early prototypical Nazi saucers, would likely have attempted tocorroborate that intelligence by conducting its own reconnaissance, confidentthat its technologies were in advance of anything the U.S. Air Force could throwup against it.So, in that context then, what if President Truman, in addition to having allthe corroborating performance characteristics that indicated that some UFOs wereindeed of terrestrial origin, had also sure and certain knowledge that they wereof terrestrial origin, and that he would hardly be risking an interplanetary warwith a potentially vastly superior opponent by issuing his “shoot down” order?As the context now begins to narrow and to focus once again on that incident inthe New Mexico desert in the summer of 1947, it will become increasingly clearthat none of the data points themselves change; what changes are theinterpretations of the military’s near-panicked reactions and motivations forthe subsequent cover-up; what changes are the interpretations of the three keycomponents of the Roswell data set: the documents, the bodies, and finally, whatwas always at the core of the story of the Roswell Incident, the technology.image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Keith Chester, Strange Company: Military Encounters with UFOs in WWII (SanAntonio: Anomalist Books, 2007), pp. 3-4.

The story of Kammler’s “think tank” was first broken byBritish journalist Tom Agoston in a crucial book entitled Blunder! How the U.S.Gave Away Nazi Supersecrets to Russa (New York:Dodd, Mead and Company, 1985).While this author has argued that most of those “supersecrets” fell intoAmerican hands, or, worse, that the most radical and exotic of thesesupersecrets remained in Nazi hands after the war, Agoston’s book is signallyimportant in that it was the first public recounting of the Kammler Group andthe first disclosure that much more was going on inside of Nazi Germany besidesthe development of jet aircraft and rockets. Henry Steven’s book Hitler’sSuppressed and Still-Secret Weapons, Science, and Technology (AdventuresUnlimited Press, 2007), contains much useful information on the Kammler Group onpp. 1-5, 324-331.32 Chester, Strange Company, p. 16.33 Ibid., p. 30.34 See my SS Brotherhood of the Bell, pp. 112-115; 272-278.35 Chester, Strange Company, p. 61.36 Ibid., p. 56.37 Ibid., pp. 68-69.38 Chester, Strange Company, p. 80, emphasis added.39 In this regard, readers are referred to my book Secrets of the Unified Field:The Philadelphia Experiment, the Nazi Bell, and the Discarded Theory, pp.296-312, where I recount “the Czech Incident,” the postwar incursion intoCzechoslovakia by a secret team of U.S. commandos to recover “documents.” Theincursion led to an international incident and to an internal Pentagon and StateDepartment investigation. As the documents reproduced in Secrets of the UnifiedField reveal, neither the Pentagon nor the State Department could ascertain whogave the orders for the incursion (if they are telling, that is!). As I detailthere, the incursion would appear to be the work either of some very secretprivate group within American intelligence and operating outside the normalchain of command of military intelligence, or the incursion may have been stagedby postwar cells of the SS, masquerading as Americans in a classic false flagoperation.40 Chester, Strange Company, p. 124.41 Linda Hunt, Secret Agenda: The United States Government, Nazi Scientists, andProject Paperclip, 1945-1990 (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1991), p. 1.42 I discuss the bargain between Gehlen and Dulles in my SS Brotherhood of theBell, pp. 75-77.43 Jim Keith, Mind Control and UFOs: Casebook on Alternative 3, pp. 46-47,citing Heinz Hohne and Hermann Zolling, The General Was a Spy: The Truth AboutGeneral Gehlen and His Spy Ring (New York: Bantam Books, 1972).44 Keith, Mind Control and UFOs: Casebook on Alternative 3, p. 28, cited in mySS Brotherhood of the Bell, p. 76.45 Christopher Simpson, Blowback: The First Full Account of America’sRecruitment of Nazis and its Disastrous Effect on our Domestic and ForeignPolicy (New York: Collier Books, 1988), p. 60.46 General Clay’s personal staff was directly involved in the interrogation ofKammler Group liaison Dr. Wilhelm Voss, and which ordered him not to speakopenly about the Kammler Group.

German SS commando Otto Skorzeny, Hitler’s Reichsbankpresident Hjalmar Schacht, Kammler’s civilian liaison, Dr. Wilhelm Voss were buta few of the Nazis training Nasser’s military and intelligence services andplanning to equip him with missiles and other advanced technologies. As I alsoshowed there, a “former” Nazi working in the Soviet Union’s Foreign Ministry inits Arab desk was also highly influential in Nasser’s decision to kick thewestern advisors out and to bring in the Soviet Union. The Nazis had, before thewar, and during this postwar Egyptian episode, cultivated contact with radicalMuslim groups headed by Banna, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Al Husseini, andhis cousin, Yasser Arafat, whom Skorzeny met and, presumably, trained. Thedirtiest part of this orchestrated stalemate is the secret Nazi SS-Zionistcooperation before and during the war: See Simpson, Blowback, p. 253.50 Joseph P.

See especially pp. v, xi, xiii, xvii-xviii, 35-36. One of the groupspraised formally in a letter on White House letterhead by President RonaldReagan was the World Anti-Communist League (p. 62). This group Martin A. Leecharacterized as “Nazi infested.” (See Martin A. Lee, The Beast Reawakens (NewYork: Routledge, 2000), p. 226n.) One forum that Bellant mentions as having twoprominent German and Nazi industrials on its advisory board is thesuggestively-named “National Military-Industrial Conference” of 1959, a groupissuing foreign policy analysis(p. 35). This is yet another indicator thatPresident Eisenhower may have had more in mind than just America’s “home-grown”military-industrial complex when he issued his famous warning to the Americanpeople upon leaving office.81 For a fuller discussion of Richter, his project, and subsequent Americaninterest in it, see my Nazi International, pp. 249-350.

Every> intelligence report dealing with the German’s World War II aeronautical> research had been studied to find out if the Russians could have developed any> of the late German designs into flying saucers.’ The conclusion was no. The> flying saucers were not an extrapolation of German designs.”> Kevin D. Randle1 The Air Force, so the argument runs, had concluded that the saucers were notanything Soviet, nor anything based on German designs, nor were they ours. Butif they were not Soviet, nor ours, then what, and whose, were they? “If theflying saucers were real, and they weren’t based on terrestrial technology, anew answer began to push to the front. The disks were obviously extraterrestrialin origin.”2 Et voila, having thus supposedly eliminated all of the terrestrialpossibilities, the only conclusion left was the highly improbable one.But a simple examination of the inherent logical implications of these sorts ofarguments and statements will reveal more hidden and dangerous assumptions, andthey are assumptions that no experienced intelligence analyst or officer wouldever make: firstly, there is the assumption that the Americans learnedeverything there was to know about wartime Nazi secret research into advancedaerodynes. Secondly, these arguments do not exhaust all the terrestrialpossibilities. Recall, for a moment, that the pre-war sightings of UFOs or“mystery aircraft” in Scandinavia did not call forth extraterrestrialexplanations just because the Scandinavian militaries could not identity aterrestrial origin for what they were dealing with. Rather, they reached animprobable conclusion, but one that was less improbable than theextraterrestrial one: they were dealing with something that came from a “secretbase,” i.e., a hidden and unknown terrestrial source.In the previous chapter we surveyed some standard UFO reports of the postwarera, and showed that many if not most of them recorded performancecharacteristics far below anything required for them to have been practicalinterplanetary technologies. Given this dataset, the U.S. Air Force in myopinion would have been extremely unlikely to have considered the possibility atthat time that they were dealing with something extraterrestrial, though by thenature of intelligence analysis, they would not have ruled it out either.In two previous books I have analyzed the Cooper-Cantwheel set of Majic-12documents from the standpoint of the internal evidence that they presentconcerning the technologies alleged for the Roswell craft, rather than from thestandpoint of whether or not they were authentic. I came to the interestingconclusion that the “Roswell dialectic” was operable in almost all of them, withthe exception of one. I noted there that the same two datasets — the bodies andthe debris — were present, and that the bodies tended to support theextraterrestrial interpretation, while the debris, though exotic, tended tosupport the terrestrial one. I noted further that in the case of the bodies, allthe details had been blacked out from the documents, leaving one with bareassertion and an argument from silence, while the technological details wereabundant, if not bizarre and peculiar. The most bizarre and peculiar of thesedetails also tended to point in a certain direction, and in the case of one setof documents, clearly and unambiguously so; they pointed to Nazi Germany.3 Fromthe internal evidence of those otherwise dubious documents, it appeared to thisauthor that Friedman was correct: whoever was “leaking” them, or forging them,appeared to have access to a great deal of information.A. THE INDISPUTABLY AUTHENTIC DOCUMENTS But what do the indisputably authentic documents say? And what conclusions andimplications can be derived from them?Here, as they say, “Ze plot thickens.”There are three indisputably authentic documents that have become a focus forufologists, and in particular for the Roswell research community, both“believer” and “skeptic,” and here, as elsewhere, both poles of the “Roswelldialectic” are active in each community, as each seeks to interpret certainstatements within them as being corroborative of their respective“extraterrestrial” or “skeptical” interpretations. Those three documents are the“Schulgen Collection Memorandum,” the “Twining-Schulgen Memorandum,” and theFBI’s “Disc Communiqué.” As will now be argued, there are in each of thesedocuments certain statements that clearly indicate that the Air Force wasconcerned about the continuing development of wartime Nazi technology, and whichcan be interpreted as suggesting that it was increasingly waking up to thepossibility, not that some UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin, but that theypossibly might be representative of an origin within some independent postwarNazi organization. Additionally, when taken as a whole, these documents, plusone additional one never considered in this regard, present an interestingGestalt that argues persuasively if not perhaps compellingly for thatconclusion.When this Gestalt is added to the U.S. Air Force’s rather late and covertinterest in the “fusion” research of Nazi scientist Dr. Ronald Richter inArgentina during 1949-1951, an even more interesting Gestalt results, one thatclearly suggests that a genuine concern has arisen within certain circles of theU.S. military that they might be dealing in some cases with an independent Nazigroup with access to some very sophisticated and extraordinary technology. As weshall discover, it is during this precise time period, the 1950s, thatpublications on the subject of anti-gravity all but disappear in the openliterature.1. THE SCHULGEN COLLECTION MEMORANDUM, 28 OCTOBER, 1947 In late October, 1947, after the Roswell Incident had already occurred,Brigadier General George F. Schulgen composed a memorandum outlining theintelligence collection needs of the United States Air Force. Since one of theintended recipients of the memorandum was the Secretary of the Air Force, thedocument makes for interesting and illuminating reading.I will reproduce the actual documents of this memoradum, and then its text,before proceeding to an analysis of its highly illuminating contents.image [images/00058.jpg] Schulgen Intelligence Collection Memorandum, Page 1 image [images/00059.jpg] Schulgen Intelligence Collection Memorandum, Page 2 image [images/00060.jpg] Schulgen Intelligence Collection Memorandum, Page 3 image [images/00061.jpg] Schulgen Intelligence Collection Memorandum, Page 4 image [images/00062.jpg] Schulgen Intelligence Collection Memorandum, Page 5 image [images/00063.jpg] Schulgen Intelligence Collection Memorandum, Page 6 A.

THE FAKED VERSION This faked version of the Schulgen Intelligence Collection Memorandum was thesame in all major respects except for the addition of one sentence, and theaddition or deletion of minor details. In order to appreciate those minoradditions and deletions, however, one must first notice what the most majoraddition was, and why it was added. On page 3 of his memorandum, GeneralSchulgen made a very significant statement, and it is worth recalling it:> 4. This strange object, or phenomenon, may be considered, in view of certain> observations, as long-range aircraft capable of a high rate of climb, high> cruising speed (possibly sub-sonic at all times) and highly maneuverable and> capable of being flown in very tight formation. For the purpose of analysis> and evaluation of the so-called “flying saucer” phenomenon, the object sighted> is being assumed to be a manned aircraft, of Russian origin, and based on the> perspective thinking and actual accomplishments of the Germans. It is worth recalling what Colonel Blanchard’s wife recalled about his initialimpression of the Roswell debris: his initial inclination was to believe thatthe debris came from something Soviet. Indeed, it will be recalled that MajorMarcel’s initial impression avoided any extraterrestrial speculations. He merelyindicated that he did not know where the debris came from, and only added thathe did not think it was of American manufacture. Its properties were toostrange. If we assume along with many ufologists that Schulgen’s collectionmemorandum is based in part as a response to Roswell — and we shall see in amoment that there are highly persuasive statements in the document itself thatit is reasonable to do so — then the last statement is pointing a finger, onceagain, clearly to Nazi Germany as the ultimate technological culprit.It is precisely here that the faked version of the Schulgen CollectionMemorandum inserts its statement, whose purpose is clearly evident from itscontents. In that version, an additional phrase is added to the last sentence,changing its meaning entirely:> 4. ...the object sighted is being assumed to be a manned aircraft, of Russian> origin, and based on the perspective thinking and actual accomplishments of> the Germans, it is the considered opinion of some elements that the object may> in fact may represent an interplanetary craft of some kind.” Whoever concocted the faked version of the Schulgen Collection Memorandumapparently did not want anyone to consider a closer look at the Germantechnology angle. Why this is so will become apparent in our analysis of thedocument below. But the forgery itself deserves a closer look.First, when one reads this statement in the context of the entirety of thedocument itself, once again one discovers absolutely no corroborative detailsthat would support the forged, additional statement’s conclusions; one hasmerely the assertion that “this is so” with no reasons being advanced for it.But what one does have in the rest of the document are interesting indicatorspointing other fingers not only to Roswell, but to Nazi Germany as well, as weshall see in our analysis.Secondly, in the forged version, the phrase added to the end of the paragraphhas clearly been added to spin the whole document toward the extraterrestrialhypothesis. It is in this spirit that other minor additions and deletions aremade to the original to create the faked document, based on the original as a“donor” document.The man who exposed the whole faked version of the Schulgen IntelligenceCollection Memorandum was the later Roswell researcher Robert G. Todd, in hisown self-published UFO journal called The Spot Report, whose motto was “Thetruth is out there... but the UFO field will never find it!” Todd, a respectedresearcher, presented his arguments against the faked version in his Friday,March 7, 1997 issue. Todd is also the researcher that was finally able to obtainMajor Jesse Marcel Sr.’s military records, and who first raised questions abouthis claims and record. Additionally, Todd was the researcher who firstdiscovered the possible connections of Roswell to Project Mogul balloons, whichthe U.S. Air Force later adopted as its latest official explanation.Unfortunately, not only does the Mogul theory not explain everything about thedebris, it accounts even less for the implications of the genuine SchulgenCollection Memorandum, as we shall see. Nevertheless, Todd’s argument againstthe faked Schulgen Collection Memorandum is a masterpiece of detailed analysis,and will be followed closely here.Todd notes that in addition to the above-noted major change in the SchulgenCollection Memorandum, several minor adjustments had to be made to the entireparagraph to square it with the addition:> By removing the phrase, “Possibly sub-sonic at all times,” the forger hoped to> remove clear proof that the drafters of the genuine document were thinking in> terms of terrestrial aircraft, and not extraterrestrial spaceships. Likewise,> in removing the “air” from the word “aircraft” to form the word “craft,” the> forger further attempted to add a sense of mystery to the documents, and by> implication suggested that the prevailing opinion among the military personnel> “in the know” was that the flying saucers weren’t merely advanced aircraft of> terrestrial origin, but instead were extremely advanced craft of> extraterrestrial origin, capable of flight both in the atmosphere and in> space. These are subtle — but substantive and highly effective — changes to> the genuine text.4 In other words, someone was spinning the document in such a way as not only toavoid a terrestrial conclusion, but to divert attention away from anyconsideration of the Nazi connection.But there were other “additions” and “deletions” that had to be made once thissignificant and central paragraph was so altered:> Paragraph 6 of the genuine document included the following passage: > A recent report indicates that the Russians are now planning to build a fleet> of 1,800 Horten VIII (six engine pushers) type flying wing aircraft. The wing> span is 131 feet. The sweepback angle is 30 degrees. The Russian version is> reported to be jet propelled. > The passage quoted above was deleted entirely from the fake version for> obvious reasons.> One hundred percent of the genuine document was geared toward the idea that> some type of object was flying around, and the thinking within Air Force> intelligence (AFIN) was that the most likely source for the aircraft was the> Russians, based on the Horten brothers’ flying wing designs. The genuine> documents are logical and internally consistent, whereas the changes the> forger made in the fake documents render them illogical and internally> inconsistent. The forger would have us believe that AFIN knew from the Roswell> incident that the flying saucers were alien spacecraft — that they really came> from outer space but they wasted the time of countless intelligence personnel> in the pointless search for the Horten Brothers, their sister, and their> associates who had knowledge of their flying wing designs, when such> information obviously had nothing whatever to do with alien spacecraft unless> the forger intends to propose the ridiculous idea that Adolph Hitler entered> into an intergalactic pact with the Aliens under which the Nazis were> furnished with advanced extraterrestrial technology that was captured by the> Russians following World War II! Fake documents don’t make sense, but the> genuine documents do make sense. There is no better proof that the fake> documents are indeed fake.5 In other words, the document makes internal, logical sense, only in its originalversion; in the fake version the internal logic breaks down completely, forwhile paragraph 6 was entirely deleted in the faked version, it neverthelessretained Schulgen’s call for intelligence officers to locate the Horten brothersand their sister!Todd unearthed other documentary emendations in the faked version, and aside-by-side comparison of them, including the crucial paragraph 4 that requiredall the others, is in order:image [images/00065.jpg]6 image [images/00066.jpg]7 image [images/00067.jpg]89 C. THE BACKGROUND AND POSSIBLE “LEAKER” OF THE FAKED VERSION While the “extraterrestrial spin” and tendentiousness is clearly evident in thefaked version, who was the forger? Here Todd’s conclusions are worth consideringcarefully, for they bear directly upon the analysis of the genuine document.Todd begins this component of his inquiry by noting that the faked version wasoriginally widely circulated by the Fund for UFO Research (or FUFOR as it iscommonly known) and by its then-chairman, optical physicist, Dr. Bruce Macabbee,well-known ufologist and consultant for the U.S. military. The faked versionformed a seminal component of Maccabee’s FUFOR publication entitled Documentsand Supporting Information Related to Crashed Flying Saucers and OperationMajestic Twelve of June 22, 1987.10But Maccabee was not the ultimate hand at work and was probably simply passingon documents he accepted in good faith. The real culprit lay deeper, andunfortunately, was a by-now familiar name and neer-do-well within ufology:> But, just about a year before, Bill Moore, head of the Roswell/MJ-12 Dream> Team, wrote an article, “Phil Klass and the Roswell Incident: the Skeptics> Deceived,” which appeared in the July/August 1986 issue of the International> UFO Reporter (IUR), in which he quoted extensively from the fake documents.> The “new Listings for Spring 1987” mailed by William L. Moore Publications and> Research, a copy of which I received in May of 1987, lists a paper entitled> “Phil Klass & The Roswell Incident: The Skeptics Deceived,” by Bill Moore. The> listing indicates that this was the first time Moore offered the paper for> sale, although it gives the date of the paper as July 1986... As far as I can> determine, Moore’s IUR article was the first public mention of the fake> documents... > ...> In his IUR article, Moore writes as though he was the person who “found” the> fake cover letter and its fake enclosures. According to Moore:> “The document is a five-page draft (not a final version) of a Secret data> collection memorandum on flying discs, intended, once finalized, for> distribution to Air Force military attaches in Europe and Asia. Apparently the> text of this draft met with someone’s disapproval because the final version —> a copy of which was found in a different file — had been somewhat reworked> before being approved for distribution. > It seems clear that Bill Moore was the first person to write about the fake> documents, and he wrote about them in such a way as to suggest that he,> personally, “found” them.11 But this was not the only clue that pointed a finger to Bill Moore as theculprit and ultimate forger:> ...(The) typewriter typestyle used on all three of the fake documents matches> the typestyle on one of at least three typewriters Bill Moore has used in the> past, but doesn’t match either of the two typestyles used to produce the> genuine documents. And as noted previously, Bill Moore uses a do it yourself> rubber stamp kit, like the one apparently used to fake the “OCT” portion of> the date stamped on the fake cover letter, and the typestyle of the impression> appears to match one Moore uses.12 Moore, in other words, was acting, once again, in the capacity he later admittedto: as a government disinformation agent and spy on the UFO community, in returnfor “inside information.”But this now raises significant and disturbing implications, for clearly, theevidence strongly suggests Moore was the forger here. The question now is: Whywould Moore, presumably on instructions, leak such a faked document? The answeris implied in the internal modifications of the faked version of the SchulgenCollection Memorandum itself: someone within the government was not trying tocover-up the extraterrestrial connection of UFOs, someone was trying to cover-upthe terrestrial, and ultimately Nazi connection.D. ANALYSIS OF STATEMENTS AND THE GESTALT OF THE GENUINE DOCUMENT But does this analysis and conclusion hold up when the genuine document itselfis in view? One need only consider the italicized portions of the genuinememorandum highlighted on pages 383-387 to see the implications that arebeginning to dawn on the U.S. Air Force. I will cite these seriatim, along withmy analysis of each, and then of their overall Gestalt:> 1) “Absence of sound except for an occasional roar when operating under super> performance conditions” (Paragraph 2b, p. 383): The roaring sounds would be> commensurate with jets, rockets, and ramjets, and indicative of a terrestrial> technology, which the overall document supports. It might further indicate —> since the context implied is “super performance conditions” — that some sort> of afterburner was in use. In any case, the technology implied does not sound> sophisticated or exotic enough to be extraterrestrial. The idea of an> afterburner or other modification to normal propulsion requirements is> suggestively corroborated by General Schulgen’s comments in paragraph 2e,> under point 4” below.> 2) “Extreme maneuverability and apparent ability to almost hover” (Paragraph> 2c, p. 383): This characteristic suggests that if a jet or similar turbine> system were the propulsive mechanism in use in saucers, then they had the> ability to vector the exhaust thrust so generated. This is a conclusion> vaguely suggested by Schulgen’s own comments in paragraph 2b under point 13> below. In any case, this point is an indicator that Schulgen suspects that he> is dealing with a unified and single phenomenon, and one with extraordinary> capabilities. Since he mentions this ability to almost hover, one may also> conclude two more features about the technology and engineering of the craft:> a) Since hovering involves exhaust vectoring, one may safely rule out any> conventional sort of ramjet as the propulsive mechanism, since these require a> forward vectoring to maintain the engine’s function itself; and,> b) Since hovering involves zero-vectoring of the craft itself, one may assume> not only that there was an advanced thrust vectoring system in use but that> the craft may have had vertical or near-vertical take-off and landing> capability. This in turn would mean that any base for such craft would require> comparatively smaller facilities to handle than a base for conventional> aircraft, and consequently, any such base would be more easily concealable,> and additionally, may not be immediately recognizable to experts trained in> conventional aerial photographic analysis.> 3) “A plan form approximating that of an oval or disc with a dome shape on the> top surface” (Paragraph 2d, p. 383): As will be seen, this description matches> the generalized descriptions not only of the Nazi saucers, but the more> conventional Horten flying wing designs, to which General Schulgen refers in> paragraphs 4, 5, 1a, 1c, and 1g, discussed under points 8, 9, 10, and 11> below.> 4) “The absence of an exhaust trail except in a few instances when it was> reported to have a bluish color, like a Diesel exhaust, which persisted for> approximately one hour. Other reports indicated a brownish smoke trail that> could be the results of a special catalyst or chemical agent for extra power”> (Paragraph 2e, p. 383): Again, the suggested or implied technology here is> that of some sort of turbine or jet-propelled craft using some sort of> “catalyst” to momentarily boost high-speed performance. Once again, the> technological indicators are of something extraordinary, to be sure, but are> not exotic enough to compel to the conclusion of an extraterrestrial origin> for them.> 5) “The ability to quickly disappear by high speed or by complete> disintegration” and “The ability to suddenly appear without warning as if from> an extremely high altitude”(Paragraph 2f and 2g, p. 383): These are the only> two points in Schulgen’s entire memorandum that may be taken as indicating> something more than just “jet turbine” saucers might be in play. Indeed, the> ability simply to “appear” or “disintegrate” could be taken as definite> signals that a much more exotic “field propulsion” or “antigravity” technology> was in play. Additionally, it will be noted that this description aptly> summarizes the general characteristics of “foo fighters” observed by air> crewmen during the Second World War. Note however, that General Schulgen is> attempting to rationalize these two odd characteristics in entirely> conventional ways as disappearance “by high speed” or the sudden appearance> “as if from an extremely high altitude.” One may take his qualifying remarks> as indicating that the General is also thinking that the saucers have an> extraordinarily high altitude capability far beyond that of any conventional> aircraft.> 6) “Evasive action ability indicates possibility of being manually operated,> or possibly by electronic or remote control devices” (Paragraph 2j, p. 383):> This is an extremely significant statement, and tends to support the thesis> (though certainly not the extraterrestrial hypothesis) of researcher Frank> Feschino and his discovery that the U.S. Air Force had in place a “shoot down”> order for the saucers, for by explicitly referring to “evasive action” General> Schulgen is clearly implying that as early as 1947 the U.S. military was> taking some sort of action — either ground-based, airborne, or some> combination of both — against the saucers. The reason is clear from the rest> of the documentary context, for Schulgen indicates that at that juncture the> U.S. Air Force suspects a Soviet Russian origin for the phenomenon, based on> German technology.> 7) “The greatest activity in the U.S. was during the last week of June and the> first week of July” (Paragraph 3, p. 384): This is another extraordinary> statement, for while there were indeed UFO reports from precisely this period,> this is also the period of the Roswell Incident itself, and Schulgen would> most likely have heard of it, both through “channels” and through the public> media. The deliberate reference to this time frame in my opinion makes it> highly likely that the motivation for his Intelligence Collection Memorandum> came in part from this Incident, and the timing of Schulgen’s memorandum —> late October 1947 — may reflect the passing of a period of the initial> examination and analysis of the recovered debris (corroborated by the Twining> memo, examined below), and thus the contents of his memorandum may also> reflect the preliminary conclusions reached by that analysis. Succinctly> stated: those conclusions were that the Air Force was dealing with an> extraordinarily advanced aerial technology, and suspected a Russian origin,> but ultimately suspected a utilization of and advancement on Nazi Germany’s> research, as noted in the point below:> 8) “This strange object, or phenomenon, may be considered, in view of certain> observations, as long-range aircraft capable of a high rate of climb, high> cruising speed (possibly sub-sonic at all times) and highly maneuverable and> capable of being flown in very tight formation. For the purpose of analysis> and evaluation of the so-called “flying saucer” phenomenon, the object sighted> is being assumed to be a manned aircraft, of Russian origin, and based on the> perspective thinking and actual accomplishments of the Germans” (Paragraph 4,> p. 384): Note now what Schulgen actually states: not only is the ultimate> technological origin suspected to be Nazi Germany, but additionally, he> specifically states that the tentative analysis has concluded that the craft> have a long range, high rate of climb, high cruising speed, and that while> they appear to be sub-sonic, he leaves open the possibility that they may be> super-sonic. In any case, when one adds to this list the Memorandum’s> previously stated performance characteristics, one also has a craft capable of> “almost hovering” and therefore presumably of near-vertical or vertical> take-off and landing capability. Note also the curious statement Schulgen> makes about its origins, for he states that it is “assumed to be ....of> Russian origin.” In other words, the door is left barely cracked that it might> be of some other terrestrial origin — namely something independently Nazi —> but we may assume that this thought may have occurred to Schulgen, given what> he addresses in the paragraphs covered below in points 9 and 10.> 9) “There is also a possibility that the Horten brothers’ perspective thinking> may have inspired this type of aircraft - particularly the ‘Parabola’, which> has a crescent plan form. Records show that only a glider version was built of> this type aircraft” (Paragraph 5, p. 384): Schlugen now gets down to> specifics, for he is explicitly suggesting some modification to the most> advanced Nazi aerial technology known to him. In other words, if one now takes> all the previous points of his Memorandum, and their implications, and adds> them together, his best preliminary guess is that he is dealing with some> profoundly modified Horten wing of long range, high cruising speed, the> ability “nearly to hover” and therefore the implied ability of nearly-vertical> or vertical take-off and landing based on some form of turbine exhaust thrust> vectoring.> 10) “...Where are these scientists now located, and what is their present> activity?” and “What is the present activity of the Horten brothers, Walter> and Riemar?” (Paragraphs 1a and 1c respectively, p. 385): Schulgen now opens> the door to the other possibility — that he was perhaps dealing with an> independent Nazi organization and development — a little more widely.> Obviously, his primary meaning must be taken to be that he suspects that they> might be in the Soviet Union. If that be the case, then it should be noted> that ultimately any intelligence gained from the Soviet Union would come to> General Schulgen via “former” Nazi general Reinhard Gehlen’s network! That> being said, however, the general nature of Schulgen’s question should be> noted, for while he clearly suspects something Soviet is involved, he does not> frame his question “Where in the Soviet Union or the Eastern Bloc are these> scientists now located?” but leaves open a more general possibility that they> could be anywhere, doing almost anything, for anyone.> 11) “Are any efforts being made to develop the Horten ‘Parabola’ or modify> this configuration to approximate an oval or disc?” Paragraph 1g, p. 385): By> asking this question, Schulgen is disclosing more about his own, and very> possibly others’, thinking about what they may have been dealing with, and if> our conclusion concerning Schulgen’s mention of the time frame of late June> and early July, 1947 is correct, and that his Memorandum at least in part> reflects a motivation prompted by the Roswell Incident and a preliminary> analysis of the same, then this question is even more revealing, for summing> all the previous points together, he has now gone beyond the flying wings of> the Hortens or anyone else, and is now thinking in terms of turbine-driven> saucers, with high rate of climb, high cruising speed, ultra-high altitude> capability, the ability to “almost hover” and thereby the assumed ability of> vertical or nearly-vertical take-off and landing by means of exhaust thrust> vectoring.> 12) “Boundary layer control method by suction, blowing, or a combination of> both” and “Openings either in the leading edge top and bottom surfaces that> are employed chiefly to accomplish boundary layer control or for the purpose> of reducing the induced drag. Any openings in the leading edge should be> reported and described as to shape, size, etc. This investigation is> significant to justify a disc shape configuration for long-range application.”> (Paragraphs 2a and 2b, respectively, p. 386): This is a knock-out punch, for> Schulgen is now suspecting that in addition to all the above technological and> engineering wizardry that somehow the Hortens, or “whoever”, has managed to> figure out a way to combine all the above technological features and to> suction or blow away the boundary layer, the thin layer of air — only a few> molecules thick — that cling stubbornly and almost in stationary fashion to> airfoils and increase drag. This is, as one of my friends put it, the “holy> grail” of aerodynamic engineering, for if a method could be found by which to> do this efficiently, drag would be greatly reduced and aircraft performance> and efficiency would be greatly increased. Additionally, with the reduction of> drag and thereby the reduction of turbulence and the heat signatures> therefrom, stealth properties of aircraft would perhaps be greatly increased> because of the reduced infrared and radar signatures of local air turbulence> around such a craft.> 13) “Type of material, whether metal, ferrous, non-ferrous, or non-metallic;”> and “Composite or sandwich construction utilizing various combinations of> metals, plastics, and perhaps balsa wood.” (Paragraphs 3 a and 3b,> respectively, p. 386): This now is a strong indicator that Schulgen’s> Collection Memorandum is somehow directly tied to the Roswell Incident, for> notice that some of the details of the Roswell debris are closely paralleled> by Schulgen’s list, which specifically mentions “non-ferrous” metal, plastics,> and “balsa wood.” Additionally, he specifically mentions a sandwich> construction, which is not recorded of any Roswell debris. Thus, if these> details are correctly interpreted to indicate a connection between the> Memorandum and the Roswell Incident, then by the same token, that Incident> involved much more than the crash and recovery of a mere balloon, Mogul or> otherwise. We are now chin to chin with the interpretive possibility of the> Roswell Incident that has been carefully excluded by the Roswell dialectic,> and all of the contrived and “leaked” documents and interpretations from and> by people with their own connections, past or present, with the U.S. military,> for we are now chin to chin with the possibility that the Incident involved> the crash and recovery of something wholly extraordinary, wholly terrestrial,> and not American.> 14) “Unusual fabrication methods to achieve extreme light weight and> structural stability particularly in connection with great capacity for fuel> storage.” (Paragraph 3c, p. 386): Schulgen now discloses his, and probably> many others’, thoughts as to why such unusual construction and fabrication> methods were employed: to decrease weight (and hence thrust and lift> requirements of the propulsion system) and to increase fuel storage and> thereby the range of the craft. General Schulgen’s reasoning, and> rationalization has thus far and throughout the Memorandum been impeccable and> tightly argued.> 15) “Provisions for takeoff from ice, snow, or water” and “Skid arrangements> for either takeoff or landing” (Paragraph 5c and 5d, p. 387): This is another> bombshell, for by asking whether such craft had provisioning or equipment for> take-offs and landings under such conditions, he is not really contradicting> the implication noted previously that the craft had the ability to “almost”> hover and thereby presumably the ability for vertical or near-vertical> take-off and landing. Rather, what General Schulgen is asking here is “where> on earth are these things coming from?” And the answer that he suspects is> implicit in the question itself: if they are coming from Russia, such> provisioning and equipment makes sense, as it would if they were coming from> anywhere else where there was a great deal of snow, ice, and water; the Andes> Mountains, the southern plains of Argentina, or Antarctica come to mind, for> example...13> 16) “Jet propulsion engines including turbo jets, rockets, ramjets, pulse> jets, or a combination of all four”; and “ Nuclear propulsion (atomic energy).> Atomic energy engines would probably be unlike any familiar type of engine,> although atomic engines might be employed in combination with any of the above> types. Aircraft would be characterized by lack of fuel systems and fuel> storage place.” (Paragraphs 6.a (2) and 6.a (3), p. 387): This is now the> explicit indicator that our previous analysis, namely, that General Schulgen> was thinking in terms of some form of conventionally powered saucer, are> correct. But note, leaving no stone unturned, he also proposes a more radical> proposition: that they might be atomically powered and hence of extraordinary> endurance and range. This should be taken in conjunction with his previous> remarks about lightweight construction, for the radioactive shielding of such> an atomic powerplant, at that day and time, would have involved a large> weight, requiring a reduction of weight elsewhere, and therefore, likely> requiring additionally the development of new fabrication techniques or wholly> new materials.> 17) “The power plant would likely be an integral part of the aircraft and> could possibly not be distinguished as an item separate from the aircraft;”> and “ It is possible that the propulsive jet is governed or influenced for> control of the aircraft. The presence of vanes or control surfaces in the> exhaust or methods of changing the direction of the object should be> observed.” (Paragraph 6b, p. 387): This final bombshell is further indication> that our previous analysis is correct, for with it General Schulgen finally> tips his hand that he is not thinking, ultimately, of a flying wing at all, he> merely suspects that somehow the Horten brothers or other scientists may have> been involved in something far more radical, namely the design of saucer> shaped aircraft, with the propulsion system as the major component of the main> structure itself, able to vector thrusts, able to “almost hover” and with the> ability of vertical or nearly-vertical take-off and landing, of great range> and endurance, and of ultra-high altitude capability, that additionally was> able to suction or blow away the boundary layer, hence improving the drag> coefficient of the aircraft and reduce its infrared and local atmospheric> turbulence signatures. Moreover, all of this, let it be noted, he is attributing ultimately totechnological and engineering principles that he explicitly ascribes, not toSoviet Russia, but to Nazi Germany!And there is one final, very important point that also emerges from thisanalysis. In the previous pages of this book it was noted that the commandingofficer of the Roswell Army Air Field, Colonel William “Butch” Blanchard,initially suspected that the recovered debris represented, not a balloon of anysort, but something Soviet! General Schulgen’s Memorandum now provides a contextfrom which to conclude that Blanchard’s initial opinion, which was related bysecondhand testimony of his widow, is trustworthy testimony, for it fits snugglyinto the wider context of the analysis of the problem of the saucers beingundertaken by the Air Force at that period of time. Consequently, Blanchard’sstatement is a further indicator that the Mogul balloon explanation is simplyfalse, and a further layer of official obfuscation of the IncidentSo what of the overall Gestalt of the document? What may one conclude about it,and more importantly, what may one conclude about it when juxtaposed with theevident fraud and deliberate “disinformation leak” of the faked version of theMemorandum and Bill Moore’s possible role in doing so? As was noted in thesummary and conclusions chapter that began this part of the book, many on bothpoles of “the Roswell dialectic” had backgrounds that connected them either tothe military, or to intelligence, or to black projects, or were stronglysuspected of having such connections. The poles of the “Roswell dialectic” thusappear to have been put into play almost from the inception of the RoswellIncident itself, and were deliberately contrived to mold any interpretation intoone of two mutually exclusive and equally “disinformative” channels: theextraordinary and extraterrestral one, or the mundane, terrestrial, andultimately trivial one. What must never be looked at or examined is thetechnologically and politically explosive hypothesis that what crashed was notonly Nazi technology, but purely and simply Nazi, for that would mean that theold enemy was alive and well, organized, and well-funded, but was also “outthere somewhere” and possessed of an extraordinary technology a decade, if notdecades, in advance of anything on American or Soviet drawing boards. In thislight, I believe it is very significant that General Schulgen, who is so veryprecise in his choice of words, and whose Memorandum is so carefully craftedfrom the standpoint of its internal technological and engineering logic, iswondering just where all this is coming from: “Where are the Hortens? What arethey doing? What type of landing gear do these things have that might indicatewhere they’re coming from?” Contextually it is clear he thinks they’re fromRussia, but he has ultimately left the door open to the other more horrifyingpossibility. His Memorandum, read in this light, may also be seen as an“internal fishing expedition” to see if anyone else in the Air Force knows, orsuspects, their ultimate origins. As we shall now see, Schulgen’s CollectionMemorandum may have been cleverly disguising from his subordinates the truththat he had already learned from a superior officer.2. TWINING-SCHULGEN MEMORANDUM In this regard, and in this interpretive context, General Nathan Twining’sprevious memorandum to Schulgen is very informative, and quite suggestive in itsown right. Once again, I have attempted to type the text in a fashion thatpreserves the flavor and feel of the document itself:> SUBJECT: AMC Opinion Concerning “Flying Discs”> TO: Commanding General Army Air Force> Washington 25, D.C.> ATTENTION: Brig. General George Schulgen> AC/AS-2> 1. As requested by AC/AS-2 there is presented below the considered opinion of> this command concerning the so-called “Flying Discs.” This opinion is based on> interrogation report data furnished by AC/AS-2 and preliminary studies by> personnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory, Engineering Division T-3. This> opinion was arrived at in a conference between personnel from the Air> Institute of Technology, Intelligence T-> 2, Office, Chief of Engineering Division, and the Aircraft, Power Plant and> Propeller Laboratories of Engineering Division T-3.> 3. It is the opinion that:> a. The phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious.> b. There are objects probably approximating the shape of a disc, of such> appreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made aircraft.> c. There is a possibility that some of the incidents may be caused by natural> phenomena, such as meteors.> d. The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb,> maneuverability (particularly in roll), and motion which must be considered> evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief> to the possibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually,> automatically or remotely.> e. The apparent common description is as follows:-> (1) Metallic or light reflecting surface.> (2) Absence of trail, except in a few instances where the object apparently> was operating under high performance conditions.> (3) Circular or elliptical in shape, flat on bottom and domed on top.> (4) Several reports of well kept formation flights varying from three to nine> objects.> (5) Normally no associated sound, except in three instances a substantial> rumbling roar was noted.> (6) Level flight speeds normally above 300 knots are estimated.> f. It is possible within the present U.S. knowledge -- provided extensive> detailed development is undertaken -- to construct a piloted aircraft which> has the general description of the object in> sub- paragraph (e) above which would be capable of an approximate range of> 7000 miles at subsonic speeds.> g. Any development in this country along the lines indicated would be> extremely expensive, time consuming and at the considerable expense of current> projects and therefore, if directed, should be set up independently of> existing projects.> h. Due consideration must be given the following:-> (1) The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin -the product of> some high security project not known to AC/AS-2 or this Command.> (2) The lack of physical evidence in the shape of crash recovered exhibits> which would undeniably prove the existence of these subjects.> (3) The possibility that some foreign nation has a form of propulsion possibly> nuclear, which is outside of our domestic knowledge.> 4. It is recommended that:-> a. Headquarters, Army Air Forces issue a directive assigning a priority,> security classification and Code name for a detailed study of this matter to> include the preparation of complete sets of all available and pertinent data> which will then be made available to the Army, Navy, Atomic Energy Commission,> JRDB, the Air Force Scientific Advisory Group, NACA, and the RAND and NEPA> projects for comments and recommendations, with a preliminary report to be> forwarded within 15 days of receipt of the data and a detailed report> thereafter every 30 days as the investigation develops. A complete interchange> of data should be affected.> 5. Awaiting a specific directive AMC will continue the investigation within> its current resources in order to more closely define the nature of the> phenomenon. Detailed Essential Elements of Information will be formulated> immediately for transmittal thru channels. I have highlighted the points in the document that are analyzed below, beforeproviding an analysis of the document’s Gestalt.> 1) “ The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb,> maneuverability (particularly in roll), and motion which must be considered> evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief> to the possibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually,> automatically or remotely.” (Paragraph 3d, p. 404): Note first that General> Twining essentially confirms General Schulgen’s later interpretations and> conclusions from the Intelligence Collection Memorandum. This is a pattern> that is consistent throughout Twining’s memo to Schulgen.> 2) “ Absence of trail, except in a few instances where the object apparently> was operating under high performance conditions.” (Paragraph 3e(2), p. 404):> Again, Twining corroborates, without additional commentary, General Schulgen’s> subsequent interpretations and conclusions.> 3) “ Normally no associated sound, except in three instances a substantial> rumbling roar was noted.” (Paragraph 3e(5), p. 404): Yet again, Twining> corroborates Schulgen’s information, but adds no new useful data to them.> 4) “ Level flight speeds normally above 300 knots are estimated.” (Paragraph> 3e(5), p. 404): This is an intriguing comment, as Twining clearly seems to be> withholding information from Schulgen. 300 knots would hardly be a very> sensational speed for any craft, terrestrial or otherwise, for the United> States, the United Kingdom, Nazi Germany all deployed ordinary> propeller-driven fighter aircraft during World War Two with top speeds in> excess of this.

On the other hand, we have also seen that Colonel> Blanchard’s initial impression was that the debris represented something> Soviet, i.e., something not American and not a balloon. Thus, with the> commanding general of the Air Materiel Command in the area during the> necessary time frame of the Roswell Incident, it not only stands to reason> that he made some preliminary examination of the debris while in New Mexico,> but that he also recognized that it was not a balloon, nor of American> manufacture. It is equally possible — as some “extraterrestrial” proponents of> the interpretation of the Roswell Incident have proposed - that this fact was> highly classified, and that therefore, given Schulgen’s own classification> clearance, Twining could not tell this to Schulgen directly. This argument we> shall return to in a moment. But given all of this speculation, how then would> Twining both “tell and not tell” his colleague that something — not> necessarily an entire craft — but that something odd and extraordinary, was> recovered? He would have to do so by calling attention to his remarks by a> curious choice of wording. That is exactly what he does. But is all this> entirely speculation? No it is not, as we shall see in the very next point:> 8) “ Due consideration must be given the following...The possibility that some> foreign nation has a form of propulsion possibly nuclear, which is outside of> our domestic knowledge.” (Paragraph 3h(3), p. 405): This remark is another> bombshell, and to see how and why, one must recall the context in which> General Twining is making it: General Schulgen’s subsequent Collection> Memorandum, it will be recalled, made specific and explicit conclusions that> the saucers came from Russian developments of captured Nazi technology, and> that one means of propulsion that might account for the extraordinary ranges> of the craft observed, and concluded by Schulgen to be Russian, was that some> method was found whereby to increase the onboard fuel of the craft through the> use of new fabrication methods, and possibly entirely new materials, or> through the use of atomic propulsion, which would have required heavy> radioactive shielding, and hence a reduction of weight elsewhere in the craft> by such new fabrication methods and/or new materials engineering. The context> in which Schulgen’s Collection Memorandum went “fishing for answers” in other> words, was suggesting that the Russians had somehow figured out how to do> this, based on developments from Nazi technology.> Now note carefully Twining’s initial statement to Schulgen, and how> carefully and deliberately worded, once again, it really is given the context> of the subsequent conclusions. Had Russia been suspected to be the source of> the saucers, Twining could easily have stated “Due consideration must be given> the following...The possibility that Russia has a form of propulsion possibly> nuclear, which is outside our domestic knowledge.” After all, it was known to> the U.S. military at that time that the Soviet Union was working on the atom> bomb, and therefore presumably other nuclear technologies. Nor was this a> matter that was likely to have been withheld from Schulgen. Nor was a Russian> origin of the craft likely to have been withheld from him either. This makes> Twining’s choice of words, once again, all that much more peculiar, and does> so in two senses. It will be recalled from our point-by-point analysis of> Schulgen’s Memorandum that Schulgen himself left the door open, just a crack,> to other possible interpretations and explanations of the origin of the> saucers. Twining’s prior statement is therefore designed, once again, to> “reveal” without breaching security, and to subtly inform General Schulgen> that “the other possibility” is indeed what his Air Materiel Command has> quietly and secretly concluded, for rather than saying “Russia has a form of> propulsion possibly nuclear, which is outside our domestic knowledge,” (an> unlikelihood in any case, since Russia’s nuclear program at that juncture was> just beginning) Twining answered that “Some foreign nation has a form of> propulsion...which is outside our domestic knowledge.” Schulgen, being an> intelligence officer, would have immediately been able to read between the> lines and understand exactly what Twining was implying by this curiously> phrased statement, namely, that the mode of propulsion was not nuclear in any> conventional sense, that it was a mode of propulsion unknown to American> scientists, and that it was in the possession of “some foreign nation” that> had self-evidently been investigating such matters. And at that time in> history, there was only one possible candidate for all those things: Nazi> Germany. Twining is thus subtly informing Schulgen that they were possibly> dealing with an independent postwar Nazi phenomenon, and that Shulgen would> have to keep quiet about it. This will be made abundantly clear when we> examine the last point in our list.> 9) “ It is recommended that:- Headquarters, Army Air Forces issue a directive> assigning a priority, security classification and Code name for a detailed> study of this matter to include the preparation of complete sets of all> available and pertinent data which will then be made available to... NACA,...> NEPA projects for comments and recommendations.” (Paragraph 4, p. 405): Within> the context of the previous points and observations, this is a highly> suggestive list of groups and agencies to be sending the proposed study> results to. For example, the presence of the National Advisory Committee on> Aeronautics (NACA), the precursor to NASA, suggests that Twining and his Air> Materiel Command have possibly concluded that the saucers may even posses a> rudimentary space capability, or at the minimum, that the technology itself> that they exhibit could be adapted to such purposes. NEPA is even more> interesting, for this acronym stands for Nuclear Energy Propulsion for> Aircraft, a special black project at that time whose purpose was to design> atomic power plants for aircraft propulsion. Given Twining’s comments noted in> point 8 above and their peculiar implications, this is further slight> confirmation that his Air Materiel Command may have concluded that it was> dealing with some exotic and unknown form of “nuclear” propulsion.> 10) “This opinion is based on interrogation report data furnished by AC/AS-2> and preliminary studies by personnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory”> (Paragraph 1, p. 404): I have reserved the first highlighted comment in> Twining’s letter to Schulgen for the last position in my analysis, because> this point contains the real bombshell. First, note that Twining’s entire memo> is under the heading of “SUBJECT: AMC Opinion Concerning ‘Flying Discs’”, thus> making the memorandum represent the considered opinion of the analysts at his> own Air Materiel Command. Now, under this caveat, note carefully the statement> he makes to Schulgen at the very beginning: the opinion of the Air Materiel> Command, Twining informs Schulgen, “is based upon interrogation report data> furnished by AC/AS-2 and preliminary studies by personnel of T-2 and Aircraft> Laboratory.” Given that the United States was not at that time at war with> anyone, least of all Russia or any of her client states, who was being> “interrogated”, and when? The answer suggested by the historical context and> by all the previously argued considerations seems rather obvious: Nazis! After> all, Twining had easy access to many of them right there at the headquarters> of his Air Materiel Command at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, and lest it be> forgotten, this was where Dr. Walter Lippisch, Nazi ramjet expert and designer> of the supersonic delta-winged P-13 ended up! All these considerations now highlight the Gestalt of Twining’s memo toSchulgen, for the entire document very subtly and very suggestively is tellingSchulgen two basic things: (1) that the saucers represented a development ofNazi technology; but, (2) the Russians were not the ones doing it, nor were theAmericans, but the Nazis themselves were the ones doing it.This brings up the “classification” argument: why would Twining have to be soself-evidently coy about doing so with Schulgen? A closer look at the Roswellextraterrestrial proponents’ “classification” argument reveals the answer.Friedman states the original form of this argument in the following fashion:> Interestingly, General Twining’s letter to General Schulgen... — in which he> states that the phenomenon of flying discs is real — is dated September 23,> 1947. This letter was classified Secret, not Top Secret, and therefore could> not have mentioned the recovery of alien wreckage. However, it certainly> indicates that there was a consensus reached about the legitimacy of flying> saucers and the need to get more information.14 But now, since we have begun to argue the Nazi interpretation, and seen that itmakes abundant sense of these two oft-cited memos within the Roswell researchcommunity, let us make a simple substitution of the word “Nazi” for the word“alien” and see if the argument makes sense:> Interestingly, General Twining’s letter to General Schulgen... — in which he> states that the phenomenon of flying discs is real — is dated September 23,> 1947. This letter was classified Secret, not Top Secret, and therefore could> not have mentioned the recovery of Nazi wreckage. However, it certainly> indicates that there was a consensus reached about the legitimacy of flying> saucers and the need to get more information. Does this substitution make sense?I contend that it does, and much more so than does any extraterrestrialinterpretation of these memoranda, for as has been seen, the technological datacontained both within the Schulgen Collection Memorandum and the initial Twiningmemo are simply insufficient to belong to any extraterrestrial spacecraft. Thecraft described are far too slow, and behave too much like high performance butnonetheless jet aircraft of some sort. Would the crash of something Nazi in theNew Mexico desert have called forth “interrogations” of German scientists inthis country?Absolutely!Would the crash of something Nazi in the New Mexico desert have been highlyclassified, so highly classified that Twining would have had to write Schulgenand “disclose” the secret in such a way that he would not be violating orbreaching any security procedures or oaths?Absolutely!Would Schulgen in turn prepare an intelligence collection memorandum demandingto gather as much intelligence on Nazi scientists and technicians suspected tobe somehow related to the phenomenon, without revealing to subordinates theexplosive political and technological secret, but ask for intelligence whilemisdirecting the political attention to Russia?Absolutely!Would Schulgen ask his agents to concentrate on any equipment features giving aclue not only to the technology but to the geological and geophysical locationsit was coming from, such as special provisions for landing and take-off fromice, snow, or water?Absolutely!Would the military and intelligence community endeavor to keep the technologicaland political implications of all this a secret long after the event, and employdisinformation agents to leak documents suggestive of an extraterrestrial or,conversely, a merely trivial and mundane, explanation?Absolutely!Would it do so if that organization were still in existence, and the technologycontinued to be developed by it or anyone else?Even more so!The final thing to be noted about all this is that Schulgen’s CollectionMemorandum, in which he not only ties the saucer technology to Nazi Germany buteven more explicitly, if somewhat unreasonably, to the Horten brothers and theirflying wing designs, was issued after Twining’s return to Ohio from New Mexico,and therefore it may be reasonably concluded that the Air Force had alreadydrawn the Nazi conclusion, and that because of its political (in addition to itstechnological) implications, it became a highly classified matter.3. THE FBI’S “DISC” COMMUNIQUÉ The final authentic document in the extraterrestrial proponents’ arsenal is theso-called “Disc communiqué” of the FBI, although it is a strange document, as weshall see. According to Randle and Schmitt, at 7:17 PM eastern time, the FBIfield office in Dallas, Texas sent a message to its Cincinnati field officeconcerning the Roswell crash, The cable was to the Director of the FBI, J. EdgarHoover, and to the FBI’s special agent in charge. According to Randle andSchmitt, the subject of the cable was “Flying Disk, Information Concerning.”15> Major Curtan (sic, Major Edward Kirton), Headquarters, Eighth Air Force,> telephonically advised this office that an object purporting to be a flying> disc was recovered near Roswell, New Mexico, this date (July 8, 1947). The> disc was hexagonal in shape and was suspended from a balloon by cable, which> ballon [sic] was approximately twenty feet in diameter. Major Curtain [sic]> further advised that the object found resembles a high altitude weather> balloon with a radar reflector, but that telephonic conversation between their> office and Wright Field had not borne out this belief. Disc and balloon being> transported to Wright Field by special plane for examin (sic). Information> provided this office because of national interest in case and fact that> National Broadcasting Company, Associated Press, and others attempting to> break the story of location of the disc today. Major Curtan [sic] advised> would request Wright Field to advise Cincinnati office results of examination.> No further investigation being conducted.16 This cable reveals a number of very interesting points not the least of which isthe assertion in the cable that both a hexagonally shaped “disc” and a balloonwere involved, and that the former was connected to the latter by a cable!If that sounds implausible, only recall this picture from the official U.S. AirForce report in which the Mogul theory was propounded, along with the admissionthat the U.S. military was conducting top secret tests of high altitude liftingbodies and spacecraft by using high-altitude balloons:image [images/00068.jpg] Balloon Launching Space Platform Randle and Schmitt could not have been expected to know about this picture, astheir book was published in the same year as the Air Force report, but thepicture and the comment in the FBI’s cable do raise an interesting implicationabout the whole “dialectic of Roswell,” and that is, the Air Force itself nowseems to be acknowledging that there was such a contrived dialectic in play allalong, since this picture aptly fills the requirement of a dialecticalsynthesis, being both something exotic and secret, and utterly mundane.Note carefully though what the cable also explicitly states: the FBI had beenadvised that the whole affair was over something resembling a “high altitudeweather balloon,” but that a subsequent telephone call with Wright Field, andpresumably therefore with Twining’s Air Materiel Command, “had not borne outthis belief.” The subsequent statement then reiterates the initial statement ofthe cable, namely, that both a disc and a balloon were involved, and that bothwere being transported to Wright Field. And lest it be thought that our analysisof the Twining and Schulgen Memoranda are in contradiction with this newdialectical twist to the Roswell story, as we shall see in the next chapter,Nick Redfern has an explanation and a scenario that maintains the Naziconnection and that does some justice, though not entirely, to our own analysisof those memoranda.4. THE FBI’S BORMANN MEMORANDUM: A RELATED DOCUMENT? Interestingly enough, the FBI was engaged in other pursuits than just flyingsaucers in the late 1940s. As I note in my previous book The Nazi International,President Harry Truman had been asked by Supreme Court Justice Jackson, theAmerican prosecutor at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials, to look into the matterof Nazi Party Reichsleiter Martin Bormann’s possible survival in Argentina orelsewhere in Latin America. The choice of the FBI to conduct this informationwas, as I noted in that book, in itself interesting, for by the time the FBIbecame involved in the hunt for Bormann, the CIA had already been formed, andgiven jurisdiction over all intelligence operations overseas. The FBI, in turn,was confined to intelligence and counterintelligence matters inside the UnitedStates and its territories, and Truman himself knew this as he had signed intolaw the very statutes creating the CIA! This makes his acquiescence in JusticeJackson’s request all the more interesting, and suggests that Truman and Jacksonavoided the CIA because they knew full well by that time that much of itsintelligence was being run by Nazi General Reinhard Gehlen’s network of “former”Nazi spies! Truman perhaps involved the FBI in these investigations because hedid not wish to risk the investigation being leaked via Gehlen’s network toBormann or any other surviving high-ranking Nazis. In any case, we do not knowwhat became of this matter, but we do know that the FBI was involved in a huntfor the notorious Reichsleiter.The following document makes it clear that not only was the FBI involved in thehunt, so was British intelligence, and moreover, Bormann appeared to be using orcontrolling the very radio network in Latin America that I earlier suggested mayhave been used to communicate with the American Paperclip Nazis:> Office Memorandum . UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT > TO: The Director TOP SECRET DATE: May 15, 1948> FROM: D.M. Ladd> SUBJECT : MARTIN BORMANN> War Criminal > Further reference is made to my memorandum of May 14, 1948, discussing the two> intercepts received from Bureau Source Two in March of 1947, indicating that> Martin Bormann is, in fact, still alive. SA17 S. W. Reynolds made inquiry at> the War Department and ascertained the following:> The release of the two messages discussing Marin Bormann, as regular> Source Two messages, caused a great flurry of excitement in British circles.> It appeared that the British were intercepting and decoding traffic over a> clandestine network, a survivor of the German defeat, with ramifications in> Europe and Germany. The existence of this network was said to be a closely> kept secret and the traffic intercepted was handled on an “eyes only” basis> (i.e. for the use only of the officer to whom addressed) instead of the> customary “top secret” basis on which Source Two material is handled. On the> day these particular messages, dealing with Bormann, were received, the Army> officer handling the “eyes only” traffic was away and the Navy got hold of the> two messages. They were published as regular diplomatic traffic by the Navy.> The State Department caused a number of photographs and descriptions of> Bormann to be printed up and circulated among various embassies. State got> considerable publicity for the allegation that Bormann was still alive. The> British were, as usual, horrified at the lack of security. Their circuit> apparently was broken up and the rumbling from the incident is still going on> in the Army.Note the implication of the document, for if Bormann was alive, and in commandof the old wartime Nazi network of powerful radio transmitters in Latin America,then this implies that a postwar Nazi organizational structure is in place.image [images/00069.jpg] The FBI Memorandum to Director Hoover on Bormann Survival and Nazi TransmitterNetwork in Latin America 5. REDFERN’S CIA AND FBI DOCUMENTATION OF THE NAZI CONNECTION Nor was this all that American intelligence was up to. A CIA document existsthat indicates that our interpretation of Twining’s and Schulgen’s memoranda isessentially correct, for American intelligence appeared to be collectinginformation concerning Nazi saucer projects as late as 1954! According toparanormal researcher Nick Redfern — from whom we will hear more in the nextchapter — this CIA report, dated 27 May, 1954, states:> A German newspaper (not further identified) recently published an interview> with George Klein, famous German engineer and aircraft expert, describing the> experimental construction of “flying saucers” carried out by him from 1941 to> 1945. Klein stated that he was present when, in 1945, the first piloted> “flying saucer” took off and reached a speed of 1,300 miles per hour within 3> minutes. The experiments resulted in three designs: one designed by Miethe,> was a disk-shaped aircraft, 135 feet in diameter, which did not rotate;> another, designed by Habermohl and Schriever, consisted of a large rotating> ring; in the center of which was a round, stationary cabin for the crew. When> the Soviets occupied Prague, the Germans destroyed every trace of the “flying> saucer” project and nothing more was heard of Habermohl and his assistants.> Schriever recently died in Bremen, where he had been living. In Breslau, the> Soviets managed to capture one of the saucers built by Miethe, who escaped to> France. He is reportedly in the US at present.18 Note that according to this report, the Nazis destroyed most of their sensitivesaucer research before it could fall into Soviet hands, and this would seem toimply that they either destroyed the projects’ accompanying paperwork andrecords, or saw to it that those records did not fall into either Soviet orAllied hands. This would be in keeping with my arguments in previous books thatthe Nazis, while dividing their less sensitive technologies more or less equallybetween the Allied and Soviet blocs, retained control of the most sensitivetechnologies for themselves, and simply relocated those projects. Since Dr.Ronald Richter’s “fusion” project in Argentina was really nothing but acontinuation of Nazi Germany’s most highly classified and advanced researchproject, the Bell,19 it stands to reason that similarly advanced and exoticprojects would also have been relocated to isolated and friendly host countriesin Latin America. As for the Horten brothers, Reimar, the designer of the pair,ended up in...you guessed it....Argentina, where he came up with this for JuanPerón:image [images/00070.jpg] image [images/00071.jpg] Horten’s Argentine Delta-Flying Wing, the I.Ae. 37, in flight over Argentina20 This, coupled with the fact that Dr. Ronald Richter continued his Bell researchin Argentina, is yet another indicator that the Nazi International was alive andwell, and using any and all available means — including the resources of othercountries — to continue their projects.In any case, this is not the only reference to Nazi flying saucers percolatinginto CIA and FBI circles in the 1950s. A November 8, 1957 FBI memorandum recordsthe statements of a Polish man who had seen some very strange Nazi technology ondisplay in the area of Gut Alt Golssen, east of Berlin, in 1944. This man, aGerman prisoner of war, had taken radio training courses in Germany in 1942, andthen, in 1944, while “enroute to work in a field,” his tractor engine stalled.The FBI’s source described hearing the high pitched whine of machinery at thatinstant, similar to an electric generator. About three hours later the FBI’ssource claimed to have seen a large circular enclosure in the same area,surrounded by a kind of “taurpalin wall” approximately fifty feet high. Fromthis tarpaulin-enclosed structure, the man claimed to have seen a vehicle riseslowly and vertically until it cleared the wall, when it began to “move slowlyhorizontally a short distance out of his view, which was obstructed by nearbytrees.” The FBI’s witness described this vehicle as being of circular shape, “75to 100 yards in diameter” (!) and “about 14 feet high” and “consisting of a darkgray stationary top and bottom sections, five to six feet high.” Not only this,but a middle section that appeared to the witness to be approximately three feethigh also “appeared to be a rapidly rotating moving component producing acontinuous blur similar to an aeroplane propeller, but extending (to) thecircumference of the vehicle so far as could be observed.”21An entire decade later, on June 8, 1967, yet another witness came forward to theFBI’s Miami field office. This witness, a graduate from the Luftwaffe’s AirAcademy was assigned to test pilot duty to a top secret project in the AustrianBlack Forest toward the end of 1944. This witnesses described for the FBI a asaucer-shaped craft of approximately 20 feet diameter that was “radio-controlledand mounted several jet engines around the exterior portion of the craft.” Theexterior portion of the craft revolved around a dome “in the center whichremained stationary.” According to the FBI report, the man’s responsibility wasto photograph the craft when it was flown. The report also states that thewitness indicated the craft had apparently successfully downed “at least oneAmerican B-26 airplane.”22There is no reason not to accept these reports as legitimate nor credible,except, of course, if one has an inherent prejudice against any UFO report thatinvolves extraordinary terrestrial technology, or unless one has an inherentreluctance to admit that the Nazis may indeed have accomplished all thesethings. If one objects that the report emanating from the former Luftwaffe testpilot is suspect because of his potential neo-Nazi leanings, or because hisreport sounds too parallel with other detailed descriptions emanating fromneo-Nazi sources in public circulation earlier than the FBI report was made,then the same cannot be said of the former Polish prisoner of war, who couldhardly be expected to bear any sympathies for the Nazis.In any case, the real significance of these reports — and especially that of thePolish prisoner of war recounting his encounter with the strange Nazi craft nearGut Alt Golssen — is that the electrical whine of the latter, coupled with whatmight have been an actual jet or similar type of turbine, indicates that theNazis were developing rather exotic and unusual combinations of otherwisestandard technologies.All of this, needless to say, gives an even wider contextual corroboration ofthe interpretation of Twining’s and Schulgen’s memoranda previously argued.B. THE DOCUMENTS OF DUBIOUS AND DISPUTED AUTHENTICITY Given all of this context, then what does one make of some of the non-authenticor disputed and dubious documents? My examination of the internal evidence ofthese documents — as mentioned previously — revealed two “contradictory” datasets, the bodies, and the debris, or technology. But curiously, many of thesedocuments pointed subtle fingers, once again, to Nazi Germany as the origin ofthe technologies.23 It is as if someone with “insider knowledge” is deliberatelyleaking “documents” designed either as a last desperate attempt to obfuscate thestory of the Roswell Incident, or designed to reveal its true nature andorigins. One is, so to speak, confronted by the pattern of “roosters” and “owls”that space program researchers Richard C. Hoagland and Mike Bara have observedinside of NASA in their bestselling book Dark Mission: The Secret History ofNASA, with roosters wanting to leak deliberate clues, but being unable to comeright out and reveal what they know, and owls trying to maintain silence abouteverything, and cover-up everything that they know.1. THE EISENHOWER BRIEFING DOCUMENT, MAJIC-12, AND GENERAL MONTAGUE The biggest clue lies squatting right in the middle of the most dubious leakeddocument of them all, the so-called Eisenhower Majestic-12 Briefing document,for that document, it will be remembered, lists General Robert Montague as oneof the members of the alleged supersecret Majestic-12 UFO study group. While thedocument offers no detailed evidence in its currently-extant version to supportits conclusion that the recovered Roswell craft and “creatures” wereextraterrestrial, Montague’s presence is suggestive of another connectionentirely, one consistent with our interpretation of all the documents cited inthis chapter, for General Montague, was the commanding general of Fort Bliss inEl Paso, Texas, which was the official home to the Paperclip Nazi rocketscientists. His presence in a document otherwise purporting to favor theextraterrestrial hypothesis is, in this author’s opinion, a serious clue andindicator that the document is not authentic, for his presence would not seem tobe internally consistent with the extraterrestrial logic of the rest of thedocument. In fact, his presence runs directly counter to it, and this suggeststhat someone wishes to point a subtle finger once again to Nazi Germany.2. THE WHITE HOT INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE In this regard, it is worthwhile recalling yet another dubious Majic-12document, and the remarks I made about it way back in Reich of the Black Sun:the alleged “White Hot Intelligence Estimate” of General Nathan Twining, adocument that is part of the subsequent Cooper-Cantwheel set. While a completereview of my remarks in that book is neither possible nor necessary here,24there are a few details worth recalling. The actual “White Hot IntelligenceEstimate” comprises the first part of a larger document entitled “MissionAssessment of Recovered Lenticular Aerodyne Objects and Implications in??????AR??”25 Blackened out portions of the document are represented by questionmarks.While the document clearly states that bodies were recovered, it also gives nodetails about these bodies, other than to strongly imply the opinion of theinitial examiners was that they were extraterrestrial. The reason that nodetails are given in the document to corroborate this conclusion is that therelevant portions of the document are blacked out!26But when it comes to the detailed descriptions of the alleged recoveredtechnologies, the details are copious, if not downright bizarre, and the mostbizarre detail of them all is that the document explicitly claims that the NaziPaperclip scientists were brought in to examine the recovered technology anddebris and asked to render their opinion! This, to me, argues strongly againstthe document’s authenticity, for notwithstanding the previously-noted laxsecurity surrounding the Paperclip scientists, I find it not only highly dubiousbut extremely doubtful that the U.S. military, if it genuinely suspected that ithad recovered an actual extraterrestrial craft, would have shown it to itsformer enemies. Indeed, the very laxness of security surrounding those Paperclipscientists would have set off alarm bells at any suggestion that they be invitedto examine such a discovery. Once again, the purpose of the document wouldappear to be to point a finger, in this case, a not-so-subtle one, to NaziGermany.This conviction only seems to grow when one examines what is actually stated inthe document concerning the recovered technology, which the Nazi Paperclipscientists allegedly interpret as some sort of “neutronic engine” for theirAmerican hosts. In the second part of the overall document, entitled “TechnicalEvaluation (Preliminary),”27 the following technological details are described:> 1) The steel of the craft was “cold-formed and heat-treated,” resulting in a> tensile strength of “150,000 pounds per square inch,” and giving 175,000> pounds per square inch of durabilty under shear-testing, which made the> fuselage “extremely strong and heat resistant;”28> 2) The object had a very low profile ratio of 6-to-1 allowing it a great> advantage “in overcoming the restrictions of the boundary layer effect in high> performance operations;”29> 3) The power plant was some type of “neutronic engine” that was powered by> deuterium. Additionally, “a series of coils and heavy magnets” were somehow> connected to this engine “via an odd group of electrodes” that were composed> of a “metal not yet identified;”30> 4) Finally, the “following elements were analyzed and found to exist in the> small neutronic power plant”:> a) “UF 6 in metallic form;> b) “Hydrogen-flouride gas;> c) “Water and uranium tetraflouride;> d) “Powdered magnesium and potassium chlorate;> e) “Metal similar to lead with a chocolate brown color;> f) “U-235 in metallic form;> g) “Beryllium;31> h) “Pure aluminum;> i) “Thorium isotope material;> j) “Plutonium powder.”32 What is extremely interesting about this list33 from this very dubious documentare the implications of each of these four points.The first point notes that the steel of the craft was actually formed by coldextrusion, and as we shall discover in a subsequent chapter, this was actuallyone of those “new methods of fabrication” alluded to by General Schulgen, andmoreover, was one of the methods of fabrication that the Nazis had brought to ahigh state of development for the period.The second point corroborates the previously-noted concerns of General Schulgenthat his agents should be on the watch for any intelligence having to do withsuctioning or reducing the boundary layer effect.The third and fourth points require a more deliberate analysis, for clearly thedocument is describing a very unconventional power plant composed of veryconventional elements oddly combined: a “neutronic power plant” evidentlypowered by some bizarre and oddball compound or compounds of everything from“powdered magnesium and potassium chlorate” to beryllium and some unknown orotherwise unspecified isotope of thorium, around which whatever container heldthis mixture apparently was fashioned “a series of coils and heavy magnets.”Now let us take stock of another point: this document was first released to thepublic in a publication by Drs. Robert and Ryan Wood in 1998.34 Why is thissignificant? Because the technological descriptions of this “neutronicpowerplant” sound suspiciously similar to the Nazi Bell device, the very devicethat Dr. Ronald Richter was continuing to research independently in Argentina,which device used a mysterious compound code-named “IRR Xerum 525” for its fuel.This compound was composed in part of thorium and beryllium oxides in additionto other radioactive compounds, all of which was electromagnetically andmechanically counter-rotated.35 Even the document’s cryptic and ambiguous phrase“thorium isotope material” is oddly relevant here, because as I note in ThePhilosophers’ Stone, one of the biggest mysteries (one which to this day noconventional nuclear analysis has ever been able to explain adequately) that theAmerican intelligence teams entering the Reich at the end of the war andsearching for clues into its atomic program could find no explanation for waswhy the Nazis were obsessed with stockpiling massive quantities of thorium. Theanswer that I advanced in The Philosophers’ Stone was that they needed such hugequantities in order to separate enough of the high-spin state thorium 229 isomerfor use in the “Xerum 525” fuel of the Bell!36So once again, why is the timing of the publication of the “White HotIntelligence Estimate” and its associated documents in 1998 so important? It isimportant because at that date, no publication existed in the English languageof any of these details concerning the Nazi Bell. All that did exist at thattime were Igor Witkowski’s the relatively-obscure publications in Polish of hisresearch on that subject.Consequently, it would seem either that someone had read Witkowski in theoriginal Polish publications, thus having access to publications and a subjectmatter that at that time were relatively obscure, or someone had anextraordinary degree of “inside knowledge” based on other sources entirely!3. THE DEBUS DILEMMA All of which now brings us to what I call “The Debus Dilemma.” Dr. Kurt Debuswas one of the many Nazi scientists brought to this country very early on underthe auspices of Operation Paperclip. Debus was the flight test administrator forVon Braun’s rocket team at Peenemünde in Nazi Germany, designing test equipmentfor the V-2 rockets. Debus was present in this country and a member of VonBraun’s Paperclip rocket team in New Mexico at the time of the Roswell Incident.Additionally, like most of those Nazis, he made his official home in El Paso andwas, of course, associated with Fort Bliss!37But this is not all there is to Dr. Kurt Debus by any means, for besides workingfor Von Braun’s secret project, Debus led a double, if not triple, life, for hewas one of the scientists directly involved with the Bell project, and moreoverwas the scientist that came up with the obscure principle of its operationcalled “magnetic fields separation.”38 It is this very same Dr. Debus who,during a security review in 1948, long after he was initially cleared to enterthis country by similar reviews in order to work here as a Paperclip scientist,was described in one rather breathless sentence as being both “an ardent Nazi”and no security threat to the national interests of the United States.But why would Debus undergo such a review at such a late date?Because the U.S. Army had learned that Debus had denounced a fellow scientist,Richard Crämer, to the Gestapo in 1942. More importantly, both Mr. Crämer andDr. Debus were mutually involved in what appeared to be a very secret project,one having nothing to do with rockets whatsover. In his own typewrittenstatement to the American authorities dated 24 March, 1949, but declassifiedapparently only much later, Dr. Debus stated this about the event and hisdenunciation of a fellow German scientist to the Gestapo, and the subsequenttribunal:> IV. Alleged Denunciation of a German > Mr. Kraemer was an employee of the AEG39 Transformatorenfabrik,40 Berlin, in> charge of their High Tension laboratory. On occasion of a technical visit to> this firm in 1938(?), I met him for the first and only time prior to the> meeting, to which the alleged denunciation is related. We had a few words> about technical matters. > In summer of fall 1942, Mr. Kraemer visited the High Tension Laboratory of the> University of Darmstadt to attent [sic] some measurements on shock waves.> After having performed the tests on which we were in good agreement, we were> waiting for Prof. Hueter and came into a nontechnical conversation for about> half an hour, which soon led to strong differences in opinions...41 Note carefully that Debus directly states that he and Crämer were workingtogether performing some tests designed to take “measurements on shock waves” atthe “high tension” (i.e., high voltage) laboratory located at the University ofDarmstadt.But what sort of “shock waves” induced by high voltage could Dr. Debus and Mr.Crämer possibly be measuring? The answer was provided to American authorities in1954 by none other than Dr. Ronald Richter in Argentina, who answered discreteinquiries from the U.S. Air Force on what his Argentine “fusion” project wasreally all about in the following way:> (We) assume, that highly compressed electron gas becomes a detector for energy> exchange with what we call zero point energy, zero point energy derives from> the exclusion principle, the exclusion principle derives from empirical data,> in a shock-wave-superimposed, turbulence-feed-back controlled plasma zone> exists a high probability for cell-like super-pressure conditions,42 gas> represents an enormously high energy capacity of exchange processes, about> 1010 (kilowatt hours) per unit volume, on the basis of exchange coupling, it> seems to be possible to ‘extract’ a compression-proportional amount of> zero-point energy by means of a magnetic-field-controlled exchange fluctuation> between the compressed electron gas and sort of cell structure in space…,> representing what we call zero point energy, it seems even possible that the> large-amplitude fluctuation signals derive from a mechanism of> energy-conversion unknown to us….plasma implosion analysis might turn out to> become an approach to a completely new source of energy.43? Additionally, the Argentine nuclear physicist that examined Richter’s claims,Dr. Jose Balseiro — and who found them dubious at best and fraudulent at worst —recorded this observation about what Richter told him his research was basedupon:> Dr. Richter has stated that the control device of the thermonuclear device is> based on the resonance obtained between the Larmor precession frequency —> which originates in the interaction of the magnetic field acting on the> intrinsic magnetic moment of the (lithium-7) atom — and that of the> oscillating magnetic field produced by a radio frequency generator. The figure> given for the constant magnetic field intensity is 15,000 Gauss. On the other> hand the device used by Dr. Richter does not produce the nuclear reaction in a> vacuum but at atmospheric pressure. Under these conditions, and with the value> of magnetic field that has been given, it is possible to show that the control> mechanism, whatever its form, cannot be achieved using the effect mentioned.44 Richter also claimed to have discovered all this in research begun in 1936 thatinvolved subjecting plasma to extreme electrical pulses or stress. Note what wenow have if all these conceptions are considered together:> 1) Richter’s work involves a “highly compressed electron gas” or a plasma;> 2) This plasma, under conditions of “magnetic field stress” that invoke “the> Lamor precession frequency” oscillating by means of a radio frequency> generator on lithium-7 atoms, that is, by rotating and stressing that plasma> via high electrical stress, i.e., high voltage;> 3) might be a means to detect and transduce, or extract energy directly from> the “zero point energy,” or the fabric of space-time itself. > So what are the connections to Debus and Crämer?> Very simple. Dr. Richer: > 1) worked for the A.E.G. company, the same company that Debus and Crämer> worked for and during the same period as Crämer’s denunciation was being> adjudicated by the Gestapo and Crämer’s lawyer, and the same company supplied> Richter’s equipment in Argentina;45> 2) was performing essentially the same type of experiments, i.e., measuring> “shockwaves” in a plasma;> 3) Debus’ specialty was precisely high-voltage direct current electricity and> measurement; and,> 4) Debus himself had proposed the idea of “magnetic fields separation.” Debus and Crämer, in other words, were most likely measuring high voltage directcurrent pulses and the shockwaves thereby created in plasmas, all of which makesit extremely likely that Debus and Richter knew each other.This is made even more likely when one considers another statement that Richtermade to the American Air Force:> I was not interested in the development of nuclear fission reactor systems but> anxious to develop a controllable thermonuclear reactor system; there was a> certain probability that the chain-reacting schemes, developed in the fall of> 1942, ignited by a shock-wave-controlled arc plasma might turn out to become a> controllable reactor system.46 That Richter claimed to have done this electrical-arc shockwave work in a plasmain the same year that Debus states he performed similar measurements is hardlycoincidental.But the ultimate connection between Debus and Richter is revealed by what theU.S. Army intelligence teams uncovered when it was investigating Debus’denunciation of Krämer to the Gestapo. These were three short documents relatedto the project in which both Debus and Krämer were involved, a project that thedocuments revealed was considered by some very high-ranking Nazi authorities tobe “war decisive” (kriegsentscheidend). I reproduce the documents on thefollowing two pages, followed by their translations.image [images/00072.jpg] “War Decisive”: Document Submitted in Behalf of Richard Krämer from the Officeof Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring image [images/00073.jpg] “War Decisive”: Statement Submitted in Behalf of Richard Krämer from theAllgemeine Elektricitäts Gesellschaft in Berlin image [images/00074.jpg] Apparently nothing about a formal certification, signed by Abraham Esau,Plenipotentiary for Nuclear Physics Research in the office of theReichsmarschall of the Reich himself, and containing the statement that Crämerwas involved in the construction of an urgently-needed piece of high voltageequipment was enough to get the attention of American counter-intelligenceinvestigating Debus, for there is absolutely nothing in his Paperclip file tosuggest that anything whatsoever was thought about it. There is not a file withso much as a blacked-out line, nor any reference to any documents not appearingin his Paperclip file. While the necessity for high voltage equipment cancertainly be rationalized along the requirements of conventional nuclearresearch, the explicit statements in the document that this equipment wassomehow “urgently” needed registered nary a quiver on the suspicion meters inAmerican counter-intelligence.The second document, from the director of the A.E.G. company’s ResearchInstitute, is much more darkly revealing:image [images/00075.jpg]4748 Remember, what brought all this about was a chance conversation between Crämerand Debus after both mean had completed tests measuring shockwaves in 1942, thesame period in which Richter also claims to have done similar work. Richteradditionally stated in his resume to the U.S. Air Force that he worked for theresearch laboratory of the AEG Company in Berlin in 1943!49 Since we knowRichter was connected to the Bell project and continuing its research inArgentina, and since it is now apparent that Debus, Crämer, and Richter alllikely knew, or knew about, each other, and all three shared the AEG company incommon, then this places Debus’ presence at Fort Bliss during the RoswellIncident into an interesting light:If the disputed “White Hot Intelligence Estimate,” whose authenticity is verymuch in doubt, contains any kernel of truth, it is likely this: of all the NaziPaperclip scientists that might have been consulted by the U.S. military for apreliminary examination of the Roswell craft and/or debris, Debus was the onemost qualified to assess any unconventional advanced field propulsion containedtherein, for that precisely was the nature of the most highly classified workthat he did in Nazi Germany. Thus, the technological details contained in thatdocument might represent a bizarrely distorted version of what Debus might havetold them, if he was inclined to say anything at all. In this respect it isimportant to recall that General Nathan Twining’s memorandum to General Schulgenexplicitly mentioned that his Air Materiel Command had come to its conclusionsregarding the reality of flying saucers in part through interrogations,suggesting that at least some of the Nazi Paperclip scientists not only atWright Field in Ohio, but in New Mexico as well, had in fact actually beenquestioned in connection to the Incident.4. A BRIEF MENTION OF AN ODD “COINCIDENCE” By the mid-1950s, during the same general time frame when the U.S. Air Force wasquietly and discretely questioning Dr. Ronald Richter about his “fusion”research, another event occurs that suggests quite strongly that the U.S.military had suddenly embarked on a crash anti-gravity engineering anddevelopment program. British aerospace and defense technology journalist NickCook, in his bestselling book, The Hunt for Zero Point, observed that around themid-1950s, the subject of anti-gravity almost completely disappeared from theopen literature, whether technical or popular. And at approximately the sametime, American physicist Thomas Townsend Brown, another advocate for thedevelopment of “electro-gravitics,” similarly “disappeared” to France to pursuethat research, only to return some time later to pursue piezoelectric researchfor the U.S. Navy.C. CONCLUSIONS: THE OUTLINES OF THE SCENARIO BEGIN TO TAKE SHAPE All these considerations suggest that the U.S. military came to the realizationthat it was dealing with some terrestrial entity that was pursuing its ownresearch into exotic propulsion systems and aerodynes. By all documentaryindicators explored thus far, that entity appears to be some independent Naziorganization, for placed into the wider context of the “Paperclip detente,”those documents suggest the politically and technologically explosive reason foran ongoing cover-up: that Nazi entity had at least a decade’s head start, if notmore, on the United States in the development of such technologies.Does such an interpretation adequately rationalize the U.S. Air Force’s “shootdown” order for UFOs, an order that we have seen may have emanated in the sameyear as the Roswell Incident itself? It not only does rationalize that order, itdoes so without the unreasonable assumption that the U.S.A. was willing to riskan interplanetary war with “extraterrestrials.”Do the documents — both authentic and disputed — make sense in the light of thewider context and the Nazi interpretation? They not only make sense, but theymake abundant sense. Would the U.S. military have “interrogated” its PaperclipNazis — as was suggested by General Twining’s memorandum — if what crashed inNew Mexico was Nazi? Most definitely. Would the U.S. military’s response to thecrash of something Nazi be one of near panic? And would it initiate a cover-upand seek to plant deep-cover disinformation and seek to control theinterpretations of that Incident? Again, most definitely.It now remains to be seen if this “exotic but terrestrial” interpretation canmake sense of the two remaining components of the Roswell dataset: the bodies,and the debris.image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Randle, Case MJ-12, p. 93.2 Ibid., pp. 94-953 See my Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 274-330, and SS Brotherhood of the Bell,pp. 326-373.

Again, Todd’s comments are worth stating: “The highlighted portions fromthe genuine document clearly referred to the location and operation of bomb baydoors on unconventional (but terrestrial) aircraft — notto the location andoperation of exotic alien doors on extraterrestrial spaceships. Still, theforger cleverly manipulated the genuine text to add weight to the idea ofextraterrestrial origin.9 Todd, “Bill Moore and the Roswell Incident: The True Believers Deceived,” TheSpot Report, Friday, March 7, 1997, p. 4. Todd comments: “Obviously a ‘tripod’arrangement would be useful only for aircraft capable of vertical take-offs andlandings. Otherwise, we might reasonably expect a tripod (as opposed to atricycle) arrangement to dig into the ground upon landing and flip the aircraftover. The genuine document contains no reference to tripod landing gear,although it does mention a skid arrangement for landing, which certainly isn’tbeyond reason, even for conventional aircraft.” Todd is correct, for NaziGermany produced a number of jet, ramjet, and rocket propelled aircraft equippedwith skids.10 Ibid., p. 1.11 Todd, “Bill Moore and the Roswell Incident: The True Believers Deceived,” TheSpot Report, Friday, March 7, 1997, p. 5.12 Ibid.13 Admiral Byrd and Operation Highjump, anyone?14 Friedman, Top Secret/Majic, p. 71.15 Randle and Schmitt, The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell, p. 60.16 Ibid., emphasis added.17 SA, i.e., Special Agent.18 Nicholas Redfern, The F.B.I.

Friedman1 It may seem odd or even “methodologically impertinent” to begin an analysis ofufologist and paranormal researcher Nick Redfern’s oft-overlooked andunder-appreciated book, The Body Snatchers in the Desert with a picture, and asurvey of a representative review of it, but in this case, there is method to mymadness. The review of Redfern’s book comes from the premier Roswell researcher,and from the man whom many regard as “the father of modern UFOlogy,” Stanton T.Friedman.A. THE REVIEW AND THE INCONVENIENT PICTUREFriedman’s principal problem with Redfern’s book is that it> focuses on the testimony of whistleblowers. His major source, the Colonel,> apparently approached him at the Crash Retrieval Conference in Henderson,> Nevada in November 2003. We don’t know who he is or how carefully he has been> vetted. A second source was a woman, the Black Widow, who claimed to have> worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and to have been aware of bodies being> used for terrible experiments and that these were the ones found at Roswell or> perhaps the Plains of San Augustine. We don’t know who she is or how much> evidence has been directly obtained to validate her story.2 These are, indeed, the types of witnesses forming the basis of Redfern’s story,and they should bother any Roswell investigator. They bother Friedman, and theybother me. They bother me almost as much as basing the extraterrestrialinterpretation of the event primarily on the bodies and upon the second-handdead-man’s testimonies for them, which, as we have seen, when the testimonies oftwo such witnesses — Sergeant Melvin Brown/Beverly Bean and the dead nurse NaomiSelff/Glenn Dennis — are excluded, one ends with a list of physiologicalfeatures hardly compelling to the conclusion that the bodies came from anotherplanet, if there were any bodies at all.But then there was this:image [images/00076.jpg] High Altitude Balloon Launching of Voyager Spacecraft3 This made what the “whistleblowers” told Redfern even more interesting, for itprovided a bit of context. Here’s how Friedman summarizes the basic thesis ofthe book:> ...the so-called Roswell Incident did not involve an alien spacecraft or a> Mogul balloon or a weather balloon radar reflector combination. Instead, what> crashed was a Horten Brothers Flying wing supported by a huge> Japanese-designed balloon and containing disabled or genetically damaged> Japanese who were used as human guinea pigs to provide data on the effects of> radiation for use in the NEPA Program. NEPA stands for Nuclear Energy for the> Propulsion of Aircraft.> There was indeed such a program beginning right after the war with Fairchild> Aircraft and Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. 4In other words, there not only was such a program, the U.S. Air Force was kindenough to provide the public a picture of balloon launching what looks like aflying saucer (in this case, a Voyager space capsule), just for good measurebefore any “whistleblowers” ever contacted Redfern, which raises interestingquestions and potentialities.B. REDFERN’S BOOK AND THE REAL ROSWELL PROBLEM But Friedman’s remarks are not all that there is to Redfern’s book, for hisbasic hypothesis is slightly different than what Friedman makes it out to be.Redfern himself begins his book by posing a question that exposes the whole“Roswell dialectic” as perhaps a false opposition that did nothing butmanipulate independent efforts to interpret the event correctly: what if, hesays, “there was another, distinctly darker explanation behind the Roswelllegend — one that summarily dismissed the balloon and crash-test dummy claimsbut that also laid to rest the theories that extraterrestrials met their deathsin the New Mexico desert?”5So what then were the bodies found at Roswell? According to one of Redfern’sanonymous witnesses, a lady who worked at the Oakridge Laboratory in Tennessee,and whom Redfern calls “the Black Widow,” the bodies were not aliens at all,they were dead Japanese victims of Progeria Syndrome who were brought to thiscountry, along with the notorious “Unit 731” of the Japanese Army. This unit,like its Nazi counterparts in Europe, conducted barbaric and inhuman tortureunder the guise of “experiments” for the ostensible purpose of creatingbiological weapons. The mentally or physically disabled, prisoners of war, orpeople with incurable conditions — like Progeria — were barbarically tortured inthese experiments, many of which were conducted without the use of general orlocal anaesthetics. And Redfern’s Black Widow was specific; there was “no doubtthat they were human — handicapped humans — and from Japan or China, I would sayto you. Some were obviously the result of inbreeding and some showedcharacteristics of larger heads, some what I now know to be progeria, sixfingers — all kinds of syndromes.”6 The Black Widow maintained that the U.S.military, which had liberated some of these victims on its island-hoppingcampaign across the Pacific during the war, had brought them back to thiscountry, and was continuing to use them as human guinea pigs doing testing ofhuman survivability in high altitudes using high altitude balloons.7 But themost disturbing aspect of her story was that the very people conducting theseexperiments for the U.S. military were some of the very same Japanese and Nazidoctors who had conducted the grizzly experiments for the Axis powers in thefirst place.8As Redfern concludes at this point of his book, “with the Black Widow’s story inmind, all the details of the Roswell story — even its inconsistencies — begin tomake sense.”9 For example, Redfern points out how the FBI’s “disc communiqué”cable, which nowhere mentions the recovery of any bodies, extraterrestrial orotherwise — and which was a “favored document” in some pro-extraterrestrialRoswell researchers’ considerations, makes even more sense in the light ofsecret U.S. military testing in high altitude balloon, using hapless handicappedand progeria victims, all being conducted by Nazi and Japanese “doctors.” Thepolitical exposure of such an operation alone would have been unthinkable to theU.S. military, and the political backlash enormous against it, only two yearsafter the defeat of the Axis powers.10 Moreover, the explanation also made muchmore sense than the U.S. Air Force’s rather lame Mogul balloon explanation,which I believe to be part of an ongoing cover-up. If Redfern’s“whistleblowers’” thesis is true, it would explain why the Air Force would seekto pawn off “crash-test dummies” as an adequate explanation for the Roswellbodies (again, if indeed any at all were recovered, for remember, with thebodies, unlike the debris, there are no good primary firsthand witnesses):> ...the horrific nature of some of the experimentation — and, indeed, most> crucially, the fact that it tied the American government to some of the most> notorious and diabolical figures in Unit 731 — meant that elements of the> military and intelligence community wanted the story systematically buried at> all costs, even more than half a century later.11 And hence the Roswell dialectic of “weather balloons” and “flying saucers” wasborn, for those two things — the disc and the balloon — constituted both thetruth and the disinformation that were designed to hide the politicallyexplosive truth that had to be hidden: the U.S. military was in league withimmoral monsters.1. REDFERN AND THE FIRST PROBLEM: THE ROSWELL DIALECTIC AND THE ROSWELLRESEARCHERS But one suspects that the real problem of Redfern’s book for so many in theRoswell research community — both “believers” and “skeptics” — is that itrejects the whole “dialectic of Roswell” and stands somewhere between the twopoles, raising uncomfortable philosophical questions not only about thePaperclip Nazis and the bodies, but about the military’s ongoing role in Roswellresearch, and therefore inconvenient and uncomfortable questions about many ofthose Roswell researchers and their motivations and objectivity as well.For example, Redfern is one of the few Roswell researchers to notice thatColonel Corso, notwithstanding the massive problems of the assertions made inhis book, cannot be entirely dismissed either, as many have done:> Corso may have stood by the extraterrestrial hypothesis from the time his book> The Day After Roswell was published in 1997 until his death in 1998, but it is> a telling fact that he maintained — in a fashion very similar to the testimony> that we have already examined — that there was a connection between the> vehicles recovered in New Mexico in 1947 and the various aircraft designed by> the Horten brothers. Were Corso’s claims those of an unwitting dupe in a> disinformation exercise that began within the Army’s Foreign Technology> Division in the early 1960s? Or, as the Colonel offers as a possibility, was> Corso, as a loyal soldier to the very end, continuing to perpetuate that same> operation for reasons that possibly relate to the ongoing and deliberate> obfuscation of the true nature of the Roswell events?12 Indeed, this is the same possibility that I have raised in the previous pages,but once one asks this question of one of the Roswell investigators withmilitary or intelligence backgrounds, one perforce asks it of most of them. As Iobserved in chapter 11, many if not most of the “major names” in Roswellresearch on both poles of the dialectic have this background in common.13 Thusthe whole story that Redfern’s “whistleblowers” told him — whether true or not —exposes the problem that has been there all along: the “Roswell dialectic”itself, which Redfern has seen clearly. For this reason alone his book isimportant, and a refreshing change from all the rotting monotony of most Roswellbooks. The importance of Redfern’s book lies not just in its story, but in itsphilosophical observation of the Roswell Incident as a dialectical story.2. REDFERN AND THE SECOND PROBLEM: THE INCONGRUOUS PRESENCE OF PAPERCLIP NAZIS But there is a second major reason Redfern’s book is highly important, and yetanother reason that one should not dismiss it simply because it relies on“whistleblower” and anonymous testimony, rather than on the far more “solid”testimony of second-hand witnesses relating ever-varying stories of what deadpeople told them about aliens with lizard skin and suction cups on tentaclesthat were used for fingers! That reason is that Redfern — like Corso — hascorrectly realized that the mere presence of Paperclip Nazis in New Mexico,working on black projects for the government — and, as we have also seen,exhibiting far too much independence from their hosts — is a relevant contextand data point to the Roswell Incident and to its interpretation. Theimplication of the scenario that Redfern’s witnesses told him is quite simple:merely to demonstrate that there were no V-2 launches at the time of Roswell, orto dismiss the resemblance of the Roswell debris to the Horten flying wings, isnot to dismiss the Nazi connection nor to disprove it, for there were othertechnologies available to them, and a vast assortment of combinations into whichthose technologies could be engineered and deployed. Redfern’s scenario offers acompletely plausible and terrestrial rationalization for the Roswell cover-up,even if it fails in certain respects of the Roswell Incident, and that is, thatif Nazis (and Japanese) were involved and if that involvement pertained to humanexperimentation, there is ample political reason to conceal the truth down toour own day, and to involve the Roswell researchers themselves in that process(as he has clearly implied in the case of Colonel Corso).3. REDFERN AND THE THIRD, FINAL, AND BIGGEST PROBLEM: BODIES ARE ALIEN, BUT NOTEXTRATERRESTRIAL, AND FULLY RATIONALIZABLE But if there is one factor, one signal central theme and implication that makesRedfern’s book one of the most crucial in Roswell research — which in my opinionit definitely is — then this would be in the fact that it utterly dispenses withany extraterrestrial rationalization of the Roswell bodies, and disclosesanother terminological obfuscation that has been present all along, namely, thatthe word “alien” can, and originally did, simply mean “foreign,” and has come tomean, in large part as a result of propaganda on behalf of the extraterrestrialhypothesis, extraterrestrials themselves.Let us recall what the features of those “aliens” were:> 1) large heads, but out of proportion to the rest of the body, and other body> proportions, such as upper-to-lower arm ratio being different than normal> humans, with the upper arm longer than the lower, and the bodies and/or heads> are often described as bald and pear-shaped or as lacking prominent normal> human chins;> 2) large eyes, and in some cases, slanted eyes;> 3) small mouths and ears, though in one case mention was made that there were> no nose or mouth or ears;> 4) bodies between four and five feet tall, though in some cases bodies as> small as two feet were mentioned;> 5) normal digits or fingers, but mention was made of four, sometimes five,> fingers, by witnesses in contexts that only four fingers may have been> visible;> 6) persistent descriptions of the bodies as being like those of children, and> moreover, children of approximately “ten years of age.” In the case of Mac Brazel’s subsequent interviews with Frank Joyce, the bodieswere described only in negative terms as:> 7) Not “green”;> 8) Not monkeys; and,> 9) Not human. And here is Redfern’s telling rationalization of the first six points of thislist:> The specific syndromes that (Barker) referred me to were Hutchinson-Gilford> progeria syndrome, Werner’s syndrome, and Ellis-can Creveld syndrome. An> examination of available data reveals astonishing similarities between> descriptions of people exhibiting these conditions and the descriptions of the> bodies recovered in the aftermath of the events at Roswell and elsewhere in> the New Mexico desert in 1947.> Ellis-van Creveld (EVC) syndrome is a form of short-limbed dwarfism. Children> with EVC are diagnosed at birth because of noticeably short limbs and other> characteristic features. The middle parts of the limbs are primarily affected,> with the shortening more apparent in the lower limbs. As the child gets older,> knock-knee or genu valgum occurs, which can require surgery, and the hands are> short and wide and have an additional digit next to the fifth finger. In> scientific terms this is referred to as postaxial polydactylyusm and occur in> virtually 100 percent of individuals with EVC. In addition, 10 to 20 percent> of people with EVC have an additional digit on the feet. Adult height ranges> from forty-two to sixty inches and skin manifestation include problems with> nails and teeth. Changes in the EVC gene are also responsible for a related> syndrome, Weyers acrofacial dysostosis, in which individuals may display mild> short stature, extra fingers and toes, and dental abnormalities.14Note that the body and limb proportions change in victims suffering from thesesyndromes, and that the height of such victims varies from between three and ahalf to five feet, within the “Roswell range” of height descriptions.Progeria victims add new considerations to the “Roswell” aliens’ descriptions,for they “rarely exceed four feet in height” and “all body hair, including theeyebrows and eyelashes, either fails to develop or is lost.” And finally “thereare also skeletal and structural abnormalities, such as a receding chin, anoversized bald head, beaklike nose, and protruding eyes.”15 Progeria victims areprecisely children, and their average life spans are from about twelve tothirteen years.16Additionally, Redfern also notes that there is strong corroborative evidence ofthe scenario that his witnesses told him — that is, that Japanese progeriavictims were used in these inhuman experiments in New Mexico — because one veryrare form of progeria in adults, Werner’s syndrome, occurs in almost 80 percentof all cases in Japan, where “first- and second-cousin marriage are more commonthan in the West.”17In other words, every physiological detail of the “aliens” reported by themajority of “witnesses” — for remember, one is dealing in large part withsecond-hand and dead-man’s testimonies — if fully rationalizable along entirelyterrestrial lines. Indeed, even Mac Brazel’s description — if one accepts theauthenticity of Frank Joyce’s testimony in this respect -can be interpreted asconsistent with these details, since someone in Brazel’s position, who isunlikely ever to have encountered victims suffering from any of these syndromes,may have concluded that what he saw was “not human.”Lest the point be missed, it is best to state it bluntly: those Roswellresearchers such as Randle and Schmitt, who have made much of the argument forthe extraterrestrial hypothesis center upon the allegedly absolutely persuasiveand compelling nature of the physiological descriptions of said bodies, aresimply talking utter and complete nonsense. And let it also be noted: whether ornot one accepts the scenario that Redfern’s anonymous witnesses related to himand that he has reported in his book is completely beside the point, for thedetails of the Roswell bodies, if there were any bodies recovered at all, can befully rationalized on a terrestrial basis. If such bodies were recovered and canever be documented by primary witness testimony or other means it would onlyargue all that much more that the scenario he was told is true. If true, thenthe bodies were indeed probably “alien,” i.e., foreign, but certainly notextraterrestrial. This brings us back to Friedman’s review, for this centralimplication of Redfern’s book could hardly have been lost upon him. The factthat he does not mention this implication at all is, perhaps, telling, for theimplication is that as far as the Roswell Incident and its interpretation areconcerned, the extraterrestrial interpretation of the bodies is dead.There are, however, interesting questions that remain. It strikes this author asvery peculiar and perhaps suspiciously so, that the U.S. Air Force, in its TheRoswell Report: Case Closed, would place pictures of balloons — which are notthe Mogul balloons that it advocated as an explanation of Roswell in the maintext of that book — launching space probes to high altitude for testing. Then,some years later, along come Redfern’s “whistleblowers” with yet another take onthe Roswell Incident: what crashed was a balloon launched Horten flying wing (orsome similar Nazi contrivance), carrying hapless Japanese progeria victims aloftfor high altitude testing.18As has already been noted, such a project would indeed provide compellingpolitical motivation for an ongoing cover-up. There is just one problem to thewhole scenario: the allegations of the recovery of bodies at the crash all stem,once again, from second-hand and dead-man testimony. Redfern’s scenario, in theend, explains bodies that many not ultimately have been there at all. As wasseen previously, when all is said and done, one is left with the crash andrecovery of some rather extraordinary debris and a subsequent attempt to coverthat up.As for extraterrestrial bodies, Redfern has, in this author’s opinion, banishedthem forever from the landscape of the Roswell Incident.So it would seem, after all, that the real problem was never the bodies (ifthere were any), but the debris. What about the debris was so extraordinary?Surprisingly, the answer may have been provided by a medical doctor entirelyunconnected to Roswell research...image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Stanton T.

Lerma is a physician who hasdevoted himself to the care of the terminally-ill and to the recounting of theirspiritual experiences, and who has a major interest in the experience of hispatients who, while clinically dead, for whatever reason, come back to life torecord their astonishing observations, Lerma has authored two books recountingthe stories of his patients, Into the Light and Learning from the Light.In the second of these books, however, Lerma recounts the story of his encounterwith one of his terminally-ill patients, and what he told him, in one of itschapters. As with the other stories recounted in the book, Lerma changes thename of his patient in order to protect his and his family’s identity. Thestory, like all the others, is largely about how this man reconciled himself tohis impending death, and found peace with God before his passing.But before he did so, the man — to whom Lerma gives the pseudonym “ColonelMarshall Bradfield” — told Lerma a remarkable story about the Roswell Incident,one that did not recount scintillating tales of recovered extraterrestrials, norweather balloons nor Mogul balloons nor even Japanese progeria victims beingflown in Horten flying wings suspended beneath high altitude balloons. He saidnothing about any hieroglyphics, or filaments having the properties of fiberoptics. “Bradfield’s” story contained none of the by-now familiar elements ofthe story of the Roswell Incident. It was astonishingly, breathtakingly,different from all those stories both for its simplicity, and for its thoroughlychilling implication.A. “MARSH’S” STORY Lerma notes that “Bradfield’s” friends had simply called him “Marsh,” after hisfirst name. In any case, Lerma first met “Marsh” when he> was a 92-year-old man who, because of his rare form of cancer, chose to be> transferred from a well-known military hospital in the east to MD Anderson> Cancer Institute in Houston, Texas. It was at MD Anderson that he was accepted> into a 12-week investigational protocol that was to attempt, as Col. Marsh put> it, “to win by losing.”> I met Marsh and his wife, Betty, as the ambulance pulled into our facility in> Houston, Texas. They were a lovely couple, holding hands and with tears in> their eyes. As they peered out the rear window of the ambulance, our eyes met> and we accepted our paths in this combined journey. As the door of the> ambulance opened, Marsh immediately asked, “Are you the doctor I was told was> going to help me come to closure on several issues in my life — you know,> forgiveness and self-love, essentially reviewing my life?”2Lerma responded that this was something that he himself did not do, but “thatGod and his angels do the best job.”3Colonel “Marsh” and his wife “Betty” soon settled into the hospice room thatwould be his last earthly stop, and as he and Dr. Lerma began to get to knoweach other better, “Marsh” finally began to reveal his story:> Marsh was born into a military family in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1923. As a> teenager, he was already accustomed to military life, having traveled around> the world with his parents. Marsh had always desired the same type of life for> himself, and joined the Army after December 7, 1941. Because Marsh had> graduated at the top of his class, he was sent to West Point, where he> graduated as a physicist six years later. Soon after his graduation he was> sent to work with the Army Science and Technology division, where he worked on> highly classified projects. I asked him if he had worked on propulsion> systems, to which he replied dryly, “Like I said, I worked in the Science and> Technology division of the Army.”4 But that was just the beginning of “Marsh’s” story to Lerma:> In the summer of 1947, Marsh returned to Roswell to spend July 4th with his> father and mother. Major thunderstorms rolled in that evening, squelching many> festivities. Similar to many Roswellians, he went back home and spent the> evening with his family. The following morning, the storms had dissipated, the> sun was shining, and it appeared that it would be another hot day — that is,> until Mac Brazel came knocking on the Bradfield door. Marsh recalled opening> the door to let Mac in and immediately noted he was quite flustered, yet with> a sense of excitement and exuberance emanating from his being. Marsh replied,> “Mac said he had heard that I was back in town for the holiday and wanted to> vsiit. He did not seem to be aware that it was only 6:45 in the morning and> that he had awakened us. This did not seem to deter him from urging me to come> to his ranch immediately. Mac came to me because we had grown up together as> boys in Roswell. he knew of my experience in the military and felt I would be> excited as he was to see what was on his ranch.”5 “Marsh” continued his story, telling Lerma that he quickly dressed and then leftwith Maz Brazel in the latter’s pickup truck, driving back up to the Fosterranch where Brazel was the foreman. According to Lerma, “Marsh told him thatBrazel:> began sharing what had occurred the night before and what he had found on his> ranch. He thought he had heard a crash the night before, but had attributed it> to the thunderstorm that had passed. It was not until the next morning, as he> drove over his land, that he discovered hundreds of pieces of metal strewn> over several hundred yards around the property. He described the metal pieces> as being anywhere from a couple of inches to several feet in size, the largest> of which sported an emblem that was very familiar to him. What was not> familiar to him was the quality of the metal, which apparently had memory. In> other words, he said that it was thin, like foil, and he could crunch it up> only to see it expand back to its original shape in a few minutes. He told me> he had seen geometrically shaped symbols on some of the metal fragments.6 As they approached the debris site in Brazel’s truck, “Marsh” jumped out of itand ran to the field, thinking perhaps that he was looking at the scene of anairplane crash.The only problem was, he could not smell the odor of airplane fuel nor anyevidence of a fire or other familiar signatures of an airplane crash.7 As“Marsh” was making these observations, however, he saw U.S. army vehiclestraveling to the northwest of the ranch.> Marsh knew at that moment that something highly secure had crashed in this> area and that the Army retrieval team had been called in. Marsh made note of> several facts: the lack of airplane fuel on the property, the small size of> the debris, the lack of engine parts, the lack of evidence of fire, and an> incomplete emblem. Whit a cold chill running up his spine, he found the shape> to be vague, but frighteningly familiar. As he pieced parts of the emblem> together, it increasingly resembled the German Iron Cross, which Hitler used> on his military vehicles and aircraft. Marsh felt twinges of fear deep in his> gut, and knew that this incident had a much higher level of security than his> clearance made him privy to, and as such he knew the consequences of being> found in the area around the crash site.> Marsh asked Mac to take him home immediately, after which he called his> commander at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Marsh was reluctant to make that> name known to me because of the sensitivity of the situation, and its> implications with regard to national security. Marsh commented that his> commander was aware of the crash, and told him that the government had been> planning a campaign of misinformation. After the war, the United States had> recruited several German scientists to continue the research on which they had> been working. One of those projects included the turbine engine as well as the> use of electromagnetic energy for flight. Hitler’s elite scientists had> created the Haunebu I craft, which were saucer-like vehicles that reportedly> employed this advanced technology toward the end of WWII.> .... The news media was abuzz in the days and weeks following the crash.> Seemingly overnight the Army had achieved its goal of convincing the public> that this crash was a craft from another world. However, that was the farthest> from the truth. The truth was that the United States had attained the> technology through the German scientists’ achievements. Marsh stated that it> was imperative that our government maintain suppression of this technology> from the public, so that our greatest enemy of that time, the Russians, could> not obtain the technology and threaten our superiority as a world power.8 And with that, one had the latest eyewitness enter the parade of Roswellwitnesses.B. ANALYSIS But as is evident, “Marsh’s” story was completely different from the mainstream“Roswell” witness story, with the exception of those who saw and handled thedebris. Even here, however, the story was different, and upon close analysis,contains some problems:> 1) The first problem is, once again, that while “Marsh” may have been an> eyewitness, his story is not. It is, once again, that peculiar Roswell blend> of second-hand and dead-man’s testimony that so often was discovered to be the> type of testimony regarding the bodies, only in this case the testimony, oddly> and uniquely, concerns the debris;> 2) The second problem will be obvious to most Roswell researchers, and that is> “Marsh’s” claim to have pieced together some debris to reveal the emblem of> the German “Balkankruez”, the straight-edged white and black crosses that were> the emblems on German military vehicles during the war.9 The real difficulty> here, however, is that Major Marcel and his son Jesse Marcel, Jr. would claim> to have tried to piece together some of the wreckage in their home on the> kitchen floor. Neither they nor Bill Brazel ever described seeing such an> emblem. It is possible that the debris they saw and handled simply did not> contain this emblem. As Friedman often says, “absence of evidence is not> evidence of absence.” A related difficulty is that this would seem at first> glance to have required two trips by Mac Brazel into Roswell, the one to pic> up “Marsh” and another to alert Sheriff Wilcox about his discovery. From the> context, it would appear that Brazel made the trip to “Marsh” after the other> trip, for apparently the Army was either already on site or just arriving.> Perhaps Brazel made one trip, first to Sheriff Wilcox, and then later, on the> same occasion, to his friend “Marsh,” which would just make the story> feasible. In any case, the differences between “Marsh’s” story and the other> debris witnesses should be noted;> 3) The third, and a majorly significant, problem is the reference to the> so-called Haunebu or Hannebu flying saucers. Rumors of these craft have been> persistent and consistent since the end of the war, oftentimes being presented> in the company of alleged drawings and plans for them. The problem is that> those originally putting out these claims are postwar neo-Nazis, and there has> never been any formal or documentary proof from the period of the war itself> that the craft ever in fact existed. However, close reading of the story in> Lerma’s book reveals the possibility that Lerma himself may simply have> attempted to do some cursory corroborative research and presented it in the> account, without making note that it was his, rather than “Marsh’s,”> observation;> 4) The final problem, and in my opinion, the most significant of them all, is> that the internal logic of the story is inconsistent, for in the way Lerma has> recounted it, “Marsh” would appear to be saying two different things:> a) On the one hand, he is implying that the crashed craft represented some> American black project based on wartime Nazi research and designs, and has> national security implications for those reasons, namely, it could not be> revealed lest the Soviet Union become aware of it; but,> b) On the other hand, he is also implying that the crashed craft was not> American, simply due to the fact that the emblem boldly emblazoned upon it was> the German Balkankreuz. It takes little imagination to see that if the craft> were American, even if captured German equipment, it would hardly be allowed> to fly in American skies with the emblem of its Nazi origins! In other words, the central contention and detail of “Marsh’s” story to Dr.Lerma is breathtaking and chilling in its implications, for the implication isnothing less than that something representing a postwar Nazi organization wasflying advanced Nazi technology over the skies of New Mexico in 1947!“Marsh’s” scenario has thus gone well beyond that proposed by Nick Redfern — andindeed is the scenario being argued in this book — for such a crash would implyseveral things, namely, that> 1) There was a postwar Nazi organization consisting of far more than just> isolated enclaves of Nazis;> 2) It was in possession of the advanced technologies it had developed during> the war and was in all likelihood continuing to develop them;> 3) It had a base of operations from which to deploy these technologies;> 4) It was operating them against the interests of the United States and was> using them to reconnoiter our sensitive military installations;> 5) It was not afraid to demonstrate or disclose its existence, for this is> also implied in the display of the Balkankreuz. “Marsh’s” story also thus rationalizes the ongoing Roswell cover-up in a verydifferent way than does Redfern’s scenario, though that rationalization remainswholly terrestrially-based. In “Marsh’s” version, the cover-up is occurring forthree mutually related reasons, not just one, and not just a political one:Firstly, the Incident is being covered-up and spun because of its nasty nationalsecurity implications, namely, that there were Nazis “somewhere out there” onplanet earth, and that they had access to extraordinary technologies and thatthey were not afraid to use them. This would indeed call forth a response fromthe military not only to cover-up and spin the event, but would also havevirtually guaranteed the establishment of some secretive study group designed tostudy the phenomenon, acquire the technology for itself, and also to hunt downtheir base or bases of operations and destroy it or them. This possibilityappears to be one of the operative reasons that the Nazis in Argentina shut downRichter’s project and moved it elsewhere — no one knows where — and why the U.S.Air Force later “put two and two together” and decided to investigate Richteryears after the fact.Secondly, the Incident is being covered-up and spun for political reasons, sinceit would hardly do, a mere two years’ after the conclusion of World War Two, forthe American public to discover that the old enemy was alive and well, andbuzzing American defensive installations with impunity.Thirdly, and finally, the Incident is being covered-up because of theextraordinary nature of the recovered technology itself, for if the implicationsof “Marsh’s” story are true, then this would have meant that the United Statesdid not “get everything” in its haul of technological booty from the ThirdReich, nor did it get best or most advanced technologies. It would have becomeimperative, at that point, not only to cover-up the crash and to concoct afabulous story of its origins, it would also have become necessary to study thattechnology, and to bend every effort to duplicate if not exceed it.There is, however, a possible reason to take the story that Dr. Lerma hasrecounted very seriously, and that reason is Lerma himself. As noted at thebeginning of this chapter, Lerma is not in any way associated with ufologicalresearch, much less Roswell research, nor has he ever shown any interest inbeing associated with it. “Marsh’s” story therefore occurs in the context of abook of other near-death stories whose ultimate aim and purpose is simply torecount the spiritual lessons that these people imparted as they drew near theirmortal end. Lerma had, and has, no interest whatsoever in promoting this or thatinterpretation of Roswell in his book; the focus is wholly spiritual, and thefact that one of his patients told him a story about the Roswell Incident issimply incidental and tangential to that purpose.“Marsh’s” story does make sense, therefore, in one significant way that thescenario outlined to Redfern by his “whistleblowers” does not, and that is thatthe cover-up continued because the Nazi organization itself continued. Theatrocities committed in this country and by the U.S. military against its owncivilians and military personnel in the wake of Paperclip are now well-known anda matter of public debate and indignation, but they are known. The scenariorecounted to Redfern is thus merely a different variation on an old theme, buthardly seems reason enough to continue a cover-up nor for his whistleblowers toremain anonymous. This implies in turn that there are still hidden reasonsmotivating that cover-up, reasons that “Marsh’s” story clearly implies.Perhaps in that light it is significant that, like Colonel Corso, another Armycolonel close to his mortal end once more pointed a finger not only to thedebris and the extraordinary technology behind it, but in doing so pointed thefinger once again, not to far-off planets in the starry sky, but to NaziGermany, and said “look there.”And so, we are now left to account for the remaining problem, the debris, and,following the pointed fingers, to see if its roots can plausibly be traced tothat dark and terrible place and time.image [images/00003.jpg] 1 Igor Witkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 12.2 John Lerma, M.D., Learning from the Light: Pre-Death Experiences, Prophecies,and Angelic Messages of Hope (Franklin Lakes, New Jersey: New Page Books, 2009),p. 117.3 Ibid.4 Lerma, Learning from the Light, pp. 119-120.5 Ibid. p. 120.6 Ibid., p. 121.7 Lerma, Learning from the Light, p. 121.8 Lerma, Learning from the Light, pp. 121-123, emphasis added.9 Lerma records it as the “Iron Cross” but this is a slight inaccuracy.

It is the debris and all itsdetailed descriptions by witnesses that any plausible theory of the RoswellIncident must rationalize, and in so doing, give an adequate account of thetheory advanced to explain the Incident.In the foregoing pages the careful reader will have observed that there arethree potent arguments employed by proponents of the extraterrestrialinterpretation of the Incident to discount the merely mundane and trivialofficial governmental explanations of the Incident as being the result of acrashed balloon and its misidentification by witnesses:> 1) If the crash were of some object, including a balloon, that was part of> some secret American black project, then the military would not have waited to> be informed of the debris by Mac Brazel, but would have been searching for it> already.

This tactic has been particularly in evidence with respect> to the late Major Jesse Marcel, Sr. The careful reader will have also noted that by giving the bodies the primacy ofplace in their arguments, Roswell researchers have been somewhat remiss in theirattentions to the debris. Indeed, no real detailed examination of itscharacteristics can be found in those researchers or their books, and there iseven less argumentation that these characteristics point to the conclusion thatthe origin of the debris is extraterrestrial. Indeed, in the final analysis, theabove three arguments really only point to the conclusion that what crashed wasexotic, or at least highly unusual, and that it was not a balloon, and notAmerican.But if not American, then whose? And if not a balloon, or an extraterrestrialspacecraft, then what?This is where a detailed examination of the debris suggests a quite revealinganswer, for as they say, the devil is in the details, and in this specific case,that particular demon is Nazi.A. THE ROSWELL DEBRIS ACCORDING TO THE WITNESSES AND SOME NAZI TECHNOLOGICALANTECEDENTS The characteristics of the debris, as described by the witnesses, are asfollows:> 1) Memory metal of “foil”: This material or metal was desribed as being no> thicker than the foil in a pack of cigarettes, yet very strong, and unable to> be creased. When wadded or crumpled up, it was observed to “uncrumple” itself> and bend back to its original shape, leaving no creases of the wadding or> crumpling process.> 2) I-beams of balsa-wood-like material, and “hieroglyphics”: This material was> described as very lightweight, resembling balsa wood or plastic, yet was not> able to be broken (by hand), burned (by a cigarette lighter), or cut by a> knife. Additionally, “geometric” or “hieroglyphic” shapes were described as> either being part of the beams themselves, or taped or painted on, and of> purplish-pink hue. Witnesses also describe these figures as “numbers” or> resembling Japanese or Chinese ideograms. Additionally, Jesse Marcel, Jr.,> M.D., also drew his recollection of these shapes under hypnosis.> 3) Unbreakable Monofilament String: “String” was described by some witnesses> as being found in the debris, which string resembled monofilament nylon> fishing line, save that it could not be broken or cut. It is to be carefully> noted that these original descriptions do not mention fiber-optic-like> properties.

There is a final point that should be noted, and this is the apparentcontradiction between points 1 and 4, namely, how could the same material beboth wadded up or crumpled up (presumably by hand) and yet not be able to bedented by a sledge hammer?If these two characteristics refer to the same material then there would appearto be a contradiction. A case could be made that in fact two different types ofmaterial were being described, that somehow inadvertently became conflated,either in the reporting of them by Roswell researchers, or by the witnessesthemselves. However, as will be seen, a case can be made from thecharacteristics of such materials that one might be dealing with one and thesame material. In any case, these characteristics will now be compared with thedevelopments in materials engineering within the Third Reich.1. MEMORY METAL Some Roswell skeptics have pointed out that there is a memory metal materialthat not only displays the memory metal characteristics of the Roswell material,but that also appears to have super-elastic properties that under certainconditions of heat allow it to return to its original shape. The material iscalled “Nitinol” and was discovered by William Buehler and Frederick Wang in1962 at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, and was a compound of nickel (chemicalsymbol Ni) and titanium (chemical symbol Ti). Thus, the name “nitinol” simplyreferred to its chemical elements — nickel and titanium — described by theirchemical symbols “Ni” and “Ti” followed by “nol” which stood for Naval OrdnanceLaboratory. The various transformation states of such materials are usuallydetermined by heat, which in nitinol’s case, allows the metal to return to itsoriginal shape.But as Roswell researchers pointed out, this was all fine and dandy, except thatnitinol was discovered in 1962, and Roswell occurred in 1947, and hence,nitinol, while a leight weight material that would have been extraordinarilystrong to an ordinary observer, and which could conceivably be made into verythin foil-like material, could not be the explanation of the Roswell debris,unless one posited a secret history of its development going back that far. Andto make such am argument, one was, of course, arguing from complete silence.There appeared to be no such development in the record.Unfortunately for the pro-extraterrestrial proponents of the Roswell Incident,there is such an earlier history, and it leads to an interesting place and time:> The effect, also called mechanical recall, was first observed by Swedish> researcher Arne ölander in certain gold-cadmium alloys in 1932. Six years> later, the effect was seen in certain copper-zinc brasses. But it didn’t> really make a splash until 1962, when William Buehler of the U.S. Naval> Ordinance Laboratory found that an alloy composed of equal parts of nickel and> titanium exhibited the strange phenomenon.3 The article obscurely hints that memory metal research was underway since itsfirst discovery in Sweden in 1932, and reveals that further allows were found —that we know about — in 1938, though the article does not say where. And at theother end of this research story, one encounters this work being done in theU.S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory, i.e., in connection to weapons research.It does not take a Nazi rocket scientist to figure out that such “memory metals”would be of intrinsic interest to any nation viewing the war clouds of World WarTwo gathering on the horizon, and that one of those countries possibly showingan interest in such metals would, of course, be Nazi Germany. From 1932 to 1945,what might have been accomplished in the development of such materialsengineering with enough money — and the world’s best chemical engineers — and alarge and secretive research group determined to explore every technologicaldevelopment to gain a technological advantage?The answer to that question lies in other suggestions in the record that NaziGermany was exploring some very unusual areas and methods of materialsengineering, for they needed such materials for a variety of very exoticprojects in aerodynamics, as will be seen below. For the moment, the factremains that we now have the clear indication that memory metals were nothingnew, that the property was known fully seven years before the outbreak of WorldWar Two, and fully a year before the Nazis took power in Germany, and that theproperty was discovered in one of Germany’s neighbors — Sweden — and thus couldhardly have failed to come to the attention of German chemists andmetallurgists. Finally, it would have been of immediate and intrinsic interestto the Nazi military-industrial complex and war machine.To put it as succinctly as possible: the memory metal characteristic of theRoswell debris points to the history of such materials, a history that began inEurope, before the war, and that was likely a research priority for the Nazis.2. “I-BEAMS” AND HIEROGLYPHSA. THE “I-BEAM MATERIAL” AND TWO PROBLEMS The problem with the “balsa-wood-like” material of the “I-beams” with theircurious “hieroglyphics” is a rather different one, for as of this writing, Ihave been unable to find within the record of Nazi research or the immediatepre-war period, descriptions of a material light-enough in weight and resemblingbalsa-wood or plastic that was not able to be cut, nor burned with a cigarettelighter. The Germans were developing plastics, it is true, and employing them inits industry and forging to a degree not thought possible until the Allies wentinto the Reich and discovered the truth.4 But reports of German research intosuper-strong materials that could withstand extraordinarily high temperaturesseem confined to metals and not to plastics.There is, however, a problem on the extraterrestrial side of explanations aswell, and that is the shape of the I-beam itself. As anyone involved in radarstealth research knows, such right-angled constructions are to be avoided asmuch as possible in stealth aircraft for the very simple reason that theyprovide highly reflective surfaces to incident radar beams. While suchsignatures could be reduced by the external configuration of a “saucer” theywould nonetheless remain. It seems to this author unlikely that an advancedextraterrestrial civilization would employ such fabrication methods on craftthat were reconnoitering American defensive installations.B. THE “HIEROGLYPHS,” INDIAN PETROGLYPHS, PLASMA PINCH, AND ELECTRON PROBABILITYSTATES When turning to the problem of the hieroglyphs, however, there are clearterrestrial connections, and interestingly enough, they would seem to point tosome rather advanced notions within plasma and quantum physics, notions which,moreover, one would expect to be present in an advanced “field propulsion”craft. Those hieroglyphics, it will be recalled, were said by some to haveremained “undeciphered.” Indeed, as we saw in chapter nine, Friedman impliedthat the presence of Dr. Donald Menzel on the alleged top secret Majic-12 UFOstudy group was in part based upon his wartime cryptographic experience and hisfacility as a linguist.But what if these symbols represented, not a language in the conventional sense,but were symbols of something else? What if they were conceptual ideograms,rather than letters or words as such? A comparison of the only known pictorialdescription of them, that of Jesse Marcel, Jr., M.D., while given underhypnosis, with those concepts in plasma and quantum physics is very revealing,and again, revealing not extraterrestrial, but wholly rationalizable terrestrialorigins.Let us recall what Marcel’s drawings looked like:image [images/00077.jpg] Jesse Marcel, Jr.’s Drawings of the Roswell Hieroglyphs While Under Hypnosis5 Additionally, it will be recalled that Marcel Sr. and other witnesses describedseeing “numbers.” Bessie Brazel Schreiber described “flowers” and pastel“designs,”6 as well as numbers arranged in columns. Her brother, Bill Brazel,described the figures as resembling southwestern American Indian petroglyphs.7In my book The Cosmic War I pointed out that well-known plasma physicist AnthonyPeratt had observed the strong resemblance of those southwestern American Indian“stick man” petroglyphs to the types of “plasma pinch” effects he was observingin his laboratories.8 Here is an example of those “stick man” petroglyphs:image [images/00078.jpg] Southwestern American Indian “Stick Man” Petroglyphs Note the figure particularly in the upper left hand corner of this diagram. Likeall the others, it has two dots to either side of the “torso” and two “arms”extended upwards, and two “legs” extended downwards.This, argued Peratt in a peer-reviewed paper,9 was merely a stylizedrepresentation of the plasma “dough-nut” or toroid that was clearly visible insome laboratory plasma pinches. In the following diagram, one has on the right atwo-dimensional “stickman” pretroglyph, and on the left, a three-dimensionalrotation of the same figure, showing its strong resemblance to a plasma pinch:image [images/00079.jpg] Three Dimensional Rotation of a Petroglyphic “Stickman” Showing Resemblance to aPlasma Pinch. Other plasma pinches could be taken to be the “flowers” Bessie Brazel Schreiberdescribed:image [images/00080.jpg] Laboratory-Produced Plasma Pinch “Flower” Would one expect to discover or find such ideograms represented in a fieldpropulsion device, especially since we have already discovered that the Naziswere researching precisely such concepts for the purposes of free-energy, theultimate doomsday weapon, and as a gateway technology to field propulsion? Toask the question is to answer it, and in answering it, we have found arationalization for why so many fingers in the documents — both the highlydubious as well as the authentic ones — seem to point to Nazi Germany.But there is an even stronger resemblance of these ideograms, as described byvarious witnesses and drawn by Jesse Marcel, Jr., than plasma pinches. WheneverI contemplated Marcel’s drawings and Bessie Brazel Schreiber’s descriptions ofthe ideograms as resembling “flowers” with “numbers in columns” accompanyingthem, I could not help but think of the strong resemblance of some of Marcel’sdrawings and this description by Bessie Brazel Schreiber to the diagrams ofelectron cloud probability distributions that result from applying a wavefunction to the hydrogen atom. Here, to give but one pictorial example of thisfrom Wikipedia, is what such diagrams actually look like when plotted:image [images/00081.jpg] Electron Cloud Probability Distribution Functions of the Hydrogen Atom10 Could these diagrams be reasonably described as “designs” and “flowers” incolumns with “numbers” accompanying them? The answer is an obvious yes, for notethe numbers accompanying each diagram that, when plugged into the wave functionformula (barely visible in the upper right hand corner of the diagram), yieldthe result of the particular distribution picture.So, on this basis, the Roswell witnesses’ descriptions of the hieroglyphics dotwo things simultaneously:> 1) They point clearly to the crash of something embodying or employing an> exotic field propulsion technology; but,> 2) to something whose technology, while exotic, is nonetheless rationalizable> on the basis of terrestrial science known at the time of the Roswell Incident. Might one expect to find such ideograms depicted in a craft utilizing suchconceptions for the manipulation of field effects around it? Once again, theanswer is yes.This implies something very important for the case that many skeptics wouldargue against Major Marcel, his son, or the other witnesses to the Roswelldebris: one does not have to impugn their characters, their memories, or theconclusions they drew from what they saw, in order to show its terrestrialconnections. One need not read into their statements one’s own skepticism, norneed one resort to tactics of argued deconstruction of their remarks — as do somany skeptics and the U.S. Air Force itself — to argue a completely nonsensicaland trivial explanation such as crashed Mogul balloons and the superficialresemblances of its “tape” with the Roswell hieroglyphics as the witnessesdescribed them. In fact, in no previous instance of Roswell research, whetherthose of the extraterrestrial or of the Mogul explanations, have the detaileddescriptions of the hieroglyphics by those witnesses and the conclusions theydrew from them been taken seriously, nor in this detail, nor subjected to thiskind of analysis for their potential physics and technological implications, ashas been done here.One need not therefore fault Major Marcel simply for concluding that theybelonged to something extraterrestrial, nor need one point out that he only cameto this conclusion until after his initial contacts with the Roswell researchcommunity. The simple fact is, Marcel like anyone else had the right to changehis mind about what he saw, and like anyone else, could simply have beenmistaken about the conclusions — that it represented something extraterrestrial— he drew from it. The invalid conclusion does not invalidate his observations,his memory, or his integrity, for those observations were formed prior to hiscontact with that community, and are corroborated by others who saw thedebris.11The conclusions of the Roswell skeptics’ community, inclusive of the U.S. AirForce’s latest official explanation, regarding the Roswell “hieroglyphs” simplydoes not represent research, it represents a kind of “higher-criticaldeconstruction” of the witnesses’ observations.In any case, this analysis of the “hieroglyphics” discloses both their exoticand extraordinary nature, as possibly being rooted in some advanced physicalmechanics, and their wholly terrestrial basis.3. MONOFILAMENT “STRING” My research has disclosed no Nazi research into anything that might resemble themonofilament, “unbreakable” string as described by Bill Brazel, Maz Brazel’sson. However, this topic will be explored more completely below with respect toColonel Corso’s claims about “fiber optics” being recovered from the RoswellIncident.4. SUPER-STRONG METAL OR MATERIAL When turning to the subject of super-hard metals, materials engineering, andNazi Germany, the picture changes completely. The claim for the Roswell debriswas that some of the “tin-foil” like metal was extremely strong and could not bedented with a sledge hammer. Additionally, the highly dubious Majic-12 “WhiteHot Intelligence Estimate” described a metal with the following characteristics:The steel of the craft was “cold-formed and heat-treated,” resulting in atensile strength of “150,000 pounds per square inch,” and giving 175,000 poundsper square inch of durabilty under shear-testing, which made the fuselage“extremely strong and heat resistant.”12 Was the Third Reich researching suchsuper-hard metals?According to researcher Henry Stevens, it was, and with a vengeance. Stevensreceived a letter from a source initially calling himself “Michael X” who laterchanged his name to “Michael X. Barton. Barton described the development of asuper-hard metal that he called “Impervium”:> In Schramberg, South Bavaria, I had a friend who’s father was a renowned> Metallurgy scientist. He experimented with the chemistry of metals. There is> little doubt but that he was one of the world’s most brilliant minds, for it> was this same scientist who invented a metal harder than diamonds. In 1935-36> the Nazis put this amazing metal — we shall call it IMPERVIUM — to use for the> first time in the airplanes of the German Air Force.13 Needless to say, such a metal would certainly fill the requirements of theRoswell “tin-foil.” But its presence on Luftwaffe airplanes would have giventhem a tremendous advantage over their Allied and Soviet counterparts, and thereis no evidence from the war that German aircraft had any extraordinary defensivecharacteristics. So Stevens maintained due skepticism regarding this revelation.Stevens was skeptical for another reason, and that is of course that once againone has second-hand anecdotal testimony about an unnamed German scientist whohad supposedly accomplished all this wondrous and miraculous metallurgy. ButStevens is no ordinary researcher, and investigated further...and made aninteresting discovery:> Curiously enough, the word “Impervium” is today the registered trademark of a> company called Northwest Research Institute, Inc. and can be found on the> internet at:> www.carbideprocesses.com/Knives/Impervium.htm> [http://www.carbideprocesses.com/Knives/Impervium.htm]> Their impervium may not be quite the Impervium described above but there are> similarities. This commercial Impervium is twice as hard as stainless steel.> It is a stainless steel like alloy of 65% iron as well as Nickel and chromium> for carbide formation. it also contains about 10% manganese and about 10%n> carbon. Then something interesting is described:> “As a final step a gas is introduced as final alloying agent.”> This gas is evidently not oxygen since the carbon content has already been> fixed by the manufacture and introduction of oxygen is done for this purpose.> What was the gas and why was it not named?...> At this same website another commercial metal alloy is described in the> discussion of Impervium. It is called “Lubricum” and it is described as> Impervium that has been “cold reduced.” The description of cold reduction is a> forging process in which a piece of Impervium is beaten long and hard enough> to re-arrange the crystalline structure of the metal, packing the molecules> tighter together.14Stevens observes that the full story of this metal, like Impervium itself, wasnot being told on the website, and that they might “constitute only partialsteps of the original German research.”15Undaunted, Stevens searched further, and hit Nazi pay-dirt:> This is all good and well if we are talking about “rumors” of super metals,> but what actual evidence is there that the Germans managed to (realize) this> technology? There is some evidence coming from government sources, one Allied> and one Axis.> As soon as the smoke had cleared off the battle ground, elite teams of Allied> scientists began combing Germany and Austria for advanced technology which> could be used against the remaining enemy, Japan. These teams of scientists,> going by various names, compiled their findings in a series of reports,> actually several series of reports. One of these series of reports was the> British Intelligence Objectives SubCommittee reports (BIOS). In report number> 142, a German advance in metallurgy is described which seems to have baffled> the British scientists of the times.> The reason this is said is that one of the German informants, upon (whom) the> British relied for information, is simultaneously given credence and then> discredited. The BIOS report says of their informant, Josef Ernst:> “In the course of interrogation it became clear, that Ernst was not at all> reliable, and though there may in some cases be a factual basis for some of> his claims, they are as a whole inaccurate and of doubtful value.”> This is a pattern seen over and over again in Allied intelligence reports. The> question is: Why use information from a source that is unreliable? Why would> these scientists report information to their superiors that they themselves> believe is wrong or inaccurate? The answer is that they are covering> themselves either way. If the information is correct, then they were the first> to report it and are to be commended. If it is false, they are on record> having warned all those concerned against this information.> The underlying truth about this and other such attempts of Allied scientists> to have it both ways in their reports is that these interviewing Allied> scientists “didn’t have a clue” if the information is accurate or not and are> just covering their butts.16So what exactly did Josef Ernst tell the British scientists that made them adoptsuch an ambivalent attitude toward his information? Very simple:> Ernst claimed the Germans had developed a method to harden steel and aluminum> beyond any means yet developed. He claimed this involved a process of nitrogen> bonding to the surface of these metals. The report says:> “Ernst claimed to have worked for many years on nitriding processes, and to> have evolved a method of hardening steels and aluminum alloys. Ernst had been> in contact with a Prof. Dr. Thalhofer of the Technische Hochschule, Karlsruhe,> who had carried out trials for the army, at Wamberg, Czechoslovakia, and is> probably the real inventor of these processes. The method for the hardening of> steel, which is claimed to produce a nitride coating up to 0.5cm thick with a> hardness of up to 1,800 Vickers, is as follows. The steel is heated to 600> degrees C and quenched in a 30% aluminum sulphate solution, which etches the> surface. When cold the steel is packed in powdered charcoal and heated to 750> degrees C, and on reaching temperature is removed from the charcoal and> quenched in a 15% sodium nitrite solution at 35 degrees C. The method is good> for drills, and silicon steels.”> Ernst goes on to say that all the equipment for operating this process is at> the house of Baroness Mangold, at Silcherhof, near Weilheim, near Munich.> Remember that the site for the Impervium research is also said to be in> Bavaria and one wonders if the two reports are possibly describing the same> research.17Still not satisfied, Stevens decided to check and see if Ernst’s story had anycontextual corroboration within contemporary American industry. He contacted thelarge American defense contractor TRW and spoke with a metallurgist about Germandevelopments during the Second World War. Stevens began by asking a question:> “What about all those super-metals the Germans were supposed to have> developed?”> To this sort of open-ended leading question the metallurgist replied that:> “It is true. The Germans developed all sorts of alloys during the war. After> the war we took them — some of them were great — we took one and gave it a TRW> number, and still market it today — we didn’t want to give the Germans credit> though.”18 Other metallurgical processes developed relied upon super-cooling andhigh-compression under extreme pressures to make metals super-hard.19 One Germanscientist even took out a postwar patent for such a super-cooled crystallinestructure to be used as a kind of “crystal explosive” of great power.20But not even this was all there was to what was going on in German metallurgyduring the Third Reich. The very same British BIOS report that records Ernst’sinformation also says something else, and very significant from any number ofcontexts:> Ernst claimed that experiments of the nitriding of aluminium alloys were> carried out at Camp Mecklenburg. Aluminium could be nitrided by active> nitrogen produced by alpha particle bombardment. A product of very high> strength was obtained, by the use of which the weight of aircraft structures> could be decreased by 50%. It was claimed that the surface of aluminium alloys> hardened in this way had a hardness of 1,000 Brinell.21 Note that this would fulfill the requirements of General Schulgen’s“Intelligence Collection Memorandum” that called for agents to be on the lookoutfor anything that would signal unusual manufacturing and fabrication processesthat could lead to reductions of aircraft weight. It will also be recalled thatSchulgen’s memorandum explicitly mentioned a “sandwich” method of fabrication, amethod somewhat suggested by Ernst’s descriptions of the first process that hedescribed to his British interrogators. As if that is not enough, Stevens notesthat postwar neo-Nazi novelist Wilhelm Landig described an aircraft producedtoward the end of the war that used super-hard aluminum.22 Landig’s novel Götzengegen Thule was described by Landig himself as being “full of realities,” andStevens wonders if this is yet another of those “realities”?23But the real interest here is the claim being made, for German metallurgyappears have hit upon the idea of super-hardening and “densification” of metalsprecisely through nuclear bombardment.Putting all of this together, it is a small step to the conclusion that theNazis may have, with enough money and time and research, invented someextraordinary combination of a super-hard memory metal that, under certainconditions, could be crumpled up and resume its shape, while remaining undentedby sledgehammers. Even if they did not, however, do this (as it much morelikely), they nonetheless showed a distinct and clear interest in metals withunusual properties, including super-density and hardness. They showed a distinctand clear interest in unusual methods of fabrication under conditions of extremecold, high pressure, and nuclear bombardment. It takes little imagination to seethat they would also have had an obvious interest in the development of memorymetals.5. MAJOR MARCEL’S POROUS METAL The final property of the Roswell debris that was observed by Major Jesse MarcelSr. was that apparently one could blow through some of this metal. And here theconnections with Nazi Germany’s technology are deep and profound, as are,incidentally, the connections to British research as well.The well-known novelist and flying saucer researcher W.A. Harbinson, best-knownfor his bestselling novel Genesis, which recounts the efforts of a postwar Nazisaucer project under the command of a fanatical American engineer named “Wilson”to dominate the world, mentions in that novel that the extraordinary detailscontained in the novel were in fact based on actual research and documentation.This documentation Harbinson later published in a book entitled Projekt Saucer,recently reissued under the title Projekt UFO. Harbinson directly addresses theproblem of the suctioning the boundary layer — the same problem, it will berecalled, that General Schulgen wanted his agents to address in his“Intelligence Collection Memorandum” — and its relationship to such porousmetal:> ...(The) belief remained that in order to get rid of the boundary layer> completely — and in order to make use of the ‘dead’ air not only for> acceleration, but for maneuvering as well — the requirement was for an> aircraft devoid of all obstructing protuberances, such as wings, rudders and> even normal air-intakes, and one not requiring a large, heavy engine. In other> words, this revolutionary new aircraft should be the perfect ‘flying wing’> that offers the least possible resistance, sucks in the ‘dead’ air of the> boundary layer, and then uses that same air, expelling it at great force, to> increase its own momentum. It would therefore had to be a circular ‘wing’ that> is, in a sense, wrapped around its suction pump, with the pump being part and> parcel of the engine: a machine shaped like a saucer.24 At this juncture, it is worth recalling the remarks of General Schulgen in his“Intelligence Collection Memorandum”:> a. Boundary layer control method by suction, blowing, or a combination of> both.> b. Special controls for effective maneuverability at very slow speeds or> extremely high altitudes.> Openings either in the leading edge top and bottom surfaces that are employed> chiefly to accomplish boundary layer control or for the purpose of reducing> the induced drag. Any openings in the leading edge should be reported and> described as to shape, size, etc. This investigation is significant to justify> a disc shape configuration for long-range application.25 Recall also these remarks toward the conclusion of that same document:> The power plant would likely be an integral part of the aircraft and could> possibly not be distinguished as an item separate from the aircraft. If jet> propulsion is used, large air handling capacity, characterized by a large air> inlet and large exhaust nozzle, should be evident. The size of entrance and> exit areas would be of interest. It is possible that the propulsive jet is> governed or influenced for control of the aircraft. The presence of vanes or> control surfaces in the exhaust or methods of changing the direction of the> object should be observed.26 By now it should be abundantly clear what the U.S. Air Force thought it might befacing, namely, jet-turbine propelled saucer-shaped craft whose extraordinaryperformance and maneuverability were based upon suctioning the boundary layerand upon the ability to vector the thrust of the exhaust for maneuvering andstability.In this context, Harbinson’s next revelations are nothing less than stunning:> Further: if such a craft could be built with a ‘porous’ metal that would act> like a sponge and remove the need for air intakes altogether, it would result> in ‘frictionless airflow’ during flight.> Speaking at the 34th Wilbur Wright Memorial Lecture held on 30 May 1946, at> the Royal Aeronautical Society in London, the well known British aerodynamics> expert Professor E.F. Relf stated that ‘a further system of regulating the> boundary layer by means of suction through minute holes heavily distributed> over the surface’ had recently been undertaken by the National Physical> Laboratory. Discussing similar possibilities at a conference held in December> the same year on the future of British Aeronautics, Sir Ben lockspeiser said> that such a plane would ‘slip through the air in the same way as a piece of> wet soap slips through the fingers.’> The speed and manoeuvering (sic) capabilities of such a craft would be> virtually limitless.> While the idea of ‘porous’ metal sounds like something from science fiction,> it was in fact being developed in Nazi Germany as well as in Britain. Among> the many other advanced experiments being run in the wind tunnel in the> Zeppelin works at Friedrichshafen were those concerning the different ‘porous’> metals, or ‘aeropermeable surfaces’, that were being created by the scientists> of Göttingen, Aachen, and Volkenrode — various compounds of magnesium and> aluminium, sinterized and permeated with microscopic holes. It was called> Luftschwamm, or ‘aerosponge’.27In other words, Major Marcel’s recollection that one could blow through some ofthis material, and that it was therefore porous, has a basis not only in Naziresearch of just a few years prior to the Roswell Incident, but his observationpoints directly to Nazi Germany.To put it bluntly: the primary witness for the extraordinary nature of theRoswell debris, Major Jesse Marcel Sr., provides a very significant clue thatwhat crashed was in fact based upon Nazi technology and aerodynamic principles.Nor may one leave these remarks and revelations just there. They require furtherclose analysis, for if one were to build such an aircraft from such a metal,then in order to preserve the aircraft integrity, the “skin” of the craft wouldeither have to be somewhat thicker than that on an ordinary aircraft tocompensate for the weakening in the metal itself caused by so many micro-holes,or that metal would have to be fabricated in such a way to make it both lighterand stronger, and hence, one would expect to find Nazi Germany’s metallurgicalscience investigating various methods to do so. And that is exactly what we havefound!Indeed, as Harbinson notes — based on the research of Italian researcher andauthor Renato Vesco28 - Luftschwamm was reportedly able to “withstand enormouspressures and a temperature of 1000o Centigrade...”29 Such a material, let it benoted, might qualify for the material that could not be burnt with a cigarettelighter noted by Major Marcel, save in one respect only, in that it was unlikelyto have appeared liked plastic or balsa-wood. Moreover, Luftschwamm was,according to Harbinson, an alloy of magnesium and aluminum.30Not content, however, with leaving things during the era of World War Two,Harbinson reports on more recent, and startling, developments:> Regarding the ‘magic metals’ and ‘invisible’ metal surfaces, according to Der> Spiegel, by 2002 a ceramic research laboratory in Dresden, Germany, had> developed aluminium that was three times tougher than hardened steel of the> same thickness — and transparent. In the same vein, ‘cold plasma’ research> presently being undertaken by research groups at Stanford, Princeton, Ohio> State, Wisconsin, and New York Polytechnic has the aim of shielding satellites> and ‘other spacecraft’ by making them invisible to radar....> As recently as 19 August 2007, journalist Peter Stothard was writing in the> Sunday Times bout ‘a miracle material for the 21st century’. The new material> is Aerogel. Though described as ‘one of the world’s lightest solids’ (so> light, indeed, that it is nicknamed ‘frozen smoke’), Aerogel can withstand> dynamite blasts and protect against heat of more than 1,300C. No surprise,> then, that it is already being tested for bombproof housing and armour for> military vehicles. No surprise, either, that NASA is already using it in the> development of insulated space suits for the first manned mission to Mars....> As Aerogel has also been described by scientists as ‘the ultimate sponge’,> with millions of tiny pores on its surface, its resemblance to Luftschwamm> would make it even more valuable as a material for future black-technology> aircraft.> Regarding thought transference, by the late 1990’s the Institute of Medical> Psychology in Tübingen, near Stuttgart in Germany, was engaged in experiments> that proved that human beings could think images on a screen into moving in> any direction they chose. The experiments were part of a program aimed at> giving humans, possibly aided with microchip implantation, the power to> control machines through thought alone. Military and commercial applications> included, for instance, giving pilots the ability to fly aircraft and fire> missiles by ‘electronic telepathy’, thus obviating the need for manual> controls.31All of this leads to some rather startling conclusions:When the original list of details and characteristics of the Roswell debris asdescribed by the witnesses who saw and examined it are considered, most of themare rationalizable on a purely terrestrial basis and on the basis of researcheither being undertaken by the Third Reich, or, in the case of the “memorymetal,” a case can be argued that such would have been of interest to Germanmetallurgists at the time to develop. The hieroglyphics, additionally, were seento bear close resemblance, not to some “unknown and indecipherableextraterrestrial language,” but to rather exotic concepts within purelyterrestrial physics. In the case of the unbreakable monofilamentary string, wehave deferred a lengthy analysis until the section on the debris and technologyas Colonel Corso alleged was recovered from the Roswell event. Only in the caseof the balsa-wood-like material that was unable to be cut or burned could noNazi antecedent be found.B. THE TECHNOLOGIES OF ROSWELL IN THE CORSO VERSION So what about Colonel Corso’s list of the debris and technologies allegedlyrecovered from the Roswell Incident? Indeed, why bother with Corso at all, sincemost of the major Roswell research proponents of the extraterrestrialinterpretation discount him? Why bother with Colonel Corso when it can beclearly demonstrated that his claims for the development of many of thetechnologies in his “Roswell Recovered Technologies List” have clear andwell-known histories?32Corso should be considered carefully simply because the weight of his argumentis that (1) the public histories of the development of some of the technologieson his list are a fabrication, and (2) because he points a clear — andoftentimes not-so-subtle finger — to Nazi Germany as the ultimate source forthose developments.Let us recall what his complete list of “recovered extraterrestrial technology”that was seeded into American industry contained:> Image intensifiers, which ultimately became “night vision”> Fiber optics> Supertenacity fibers> Lasers> Molecular alignment metallic alloys> Integrated circuits and microminiaturization of logic boards> HARP (High Altitude Research Project)> Project Horizon (moon base)> Portable atomic generators (ion propulsion drive)> Irradiated Food> “Third Brain” guidance systems (EBE headbands)> Particle beams (“Star Wars” antimissile energy weapons)> Electromagnetic propulsion systems> Depleted uranium projectiles.33 Elsewhere in his book he mentions the following list during his statement of hismain “Roswell thesis”:> Today, items such as lasers, integrated circuitry, fiber optics networks,> accelerated particle-beam devices, and even the Kevlar material in bulletproof> vests are all commonplace. Yet the seeds for the development of all of them> were found in the crash of the alien craft at Roswell and turned up in my> files fourteen years later.34 And finally, let us recall his curious mention of the resemblance of all thisexotic technology to the Nazis:> In those confusing hours after the discovery of the crashed Roswell alien> craft, the army determined that in the absence of any other information it had> to be an extraterrestrial. Worse, the fact that this craft and other flying> saucers had been surveilling our defensive installations and even seemed to> evidence a technology we’d seen evidenced by the Nazis caused the military to> assume these flying saucers had hostile intentions and might have even> interfered in human events during the war.35 So, if one combines these two lists one obtains the following list oftechnologies, which will be examined here (note that I have omitted thosetechnologies of no immediate bearing to the argument and concentrated on themore exotic technologies listed by Corso):> 1) Fiber optics;> 2) Supertenacity fibers (Kevlar);> 3) Image intensifiers or night vision;> 4) Lasers;> 5) Particle accelerators and particle beams;> 6) Integrated circuits and microminiaturuzation of logic boards (and the> transistor);> 7) Portable atomic generators (ion propulsion drive), that is to say, atomic> powered aircraft and space craft; Each of these will now be examined.1. FIBER OPTICS It may come as a surprise to many, but the idea of using light waves to modulateand carry the sound of the human voice over great distances is not a modern one.In fact, it comes from the 19th century and from none other than the inventor ofthe telephone, Alexander Graham Bell himself. Bell actually patented a devicethat he called the “photophone” for the optical transmission of acousticsignals. Moreover, Bell regarded it and not the telephone for which he becamefamous, as his greatest invention. The problem, however, was that light traveledin straight lines, and there was — at that time anyway — no really practical wayto “bend” it. Nor was there any practical way to get that light to travel greatdistances without the inevitable atmospheric distortion and degradation of thesignal.Fiber optics solved all of this, of course, but there were two requirements inits technology tree before they became practical. Firstly, an effective carriermedium had to be designed that was flexible, but not easily breakable, and thatcould carry light, namely, fiberglass. Secondly, the light itself had to be madecoherent so that it could travel through such a flexible carrier. In short, itrequired the invention of the laser.Given these two requirements, it is exceedingly odd that one encounters in thedocumentation of Nazi technology captured after the war a curious reference tosomething called “optical telephony.”36 No one really even knows what it meansnor to what project it refers, or if they do, they are not telling.But the very fact that the Nazis would have been investigating this idea is initself quite suggestive, for they would have known that to make any such ideapractical, the two requirements noted previously — namely, the requirements fora the development of a practical, flexible carrying medium, and for a form oflight itself that could travel along such a medium — was needed. In other words,the fact that they were researching this idea at all is an indicator that theywere also researching in areas of materials engineering far in advance of therest of the world at that time, and that they were also investigating the ideaof coherent light, or lasers, about which more below.2. KEVLAR The second item in Corso’s list is super-tenacious fibers, or Kevlar. There isabsolutely no document known to me that the Nazis were engaged in any suchresearch.That said, it is known that the notorious German chemicals cartel, I.G. Farben,was one of the many firms engaged not only in researching plastics, but alsosynthetic fabrics and fibers. Such research would indeed be condign to theabove-indicated quest for a flexible light-bearing medium, and would fit thewider pattern of research in the Third Reich for exotic materials with unusualproperties of super-hardness and so on.In this respect, it is interesting that Polish researcher Igor Witkowskipresents the following picture of an water-resistance test of a synthetic fabricproduced by I.G. Farben:image [images/00082.jpg] Test of Water Resistance of an I.G. Farben Synthetic Fabric37 3. NIGHT VISION Corso’s claims that night vision image enhancing technology was developed iseasily refuted by a couple of pictures; no comment needed:image [images/00083.jpg] German Infrared Site Equipment Deployed on a PzKw. Panther Medium Tank38 image [images/00084.jpg] German Infrared Equipment For Naval Vessels 4. LASERS AND PARTICLE ACCELERATORS With Corso’s assertions regarding lasers, however, a more extensive commentaryis needed. The odd historical fact about lasers is that, while the term “laser”— standing for “light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation” — wasnot invented until the actual first publicly known invention of the device inthe early 1960s, the physics for such a device already existed within thequantum mechanics of the 1930s. Indeed, many historians of science have alwayspuzzled over why it took so long for the device to be invented.The real reason may lie, not in the fact that someone did not think of the ideauntil comparatively late, and in connection to the rather harmless applicationof denting razor blades with red beams of light, but rather in the fact thatsomeone thought of it comparatively early, thought of it in conjunction with ahorrendous practical application for it, and thought of both in the Third Reichto boot.The first public mention of actual Nazi research into lasers in fact occurred inBritish journalist Tom Agoston’s book, Blunder!: How the U.S. Gave Away NaziSupersecrets to Russia. Agoston’s book was the first book to reveal theexistence of SS General Hans Kammler’s ultra-top secret “black projects thinktank” inside the Skoda munitions work’s engineering division in Pilsen,Czechoslovakia. Agoston mentioned the extensive sweep of the Kammler Group’sresearch as follows:> Its purpose was to pave the way for building nuclear-powered aircraft, working> on the application of nuclear energy for propelling missiles and aircraft,> laser beams, then still referred to as “death rays”; a variety of homing> rockets; and to seek other potential areas for high-technology breakthrough.40 In other words, almost every exotic research project undertaken in the ThirdReich had some connection to the Kammler Group, whose ultimate purpose, let itbe noted, was to create an exotic aeronautics technology.But in many cases Agoston fails to provide documentary proof or to argue theassertions in his book, and in the case of lasers, this is one of them. Then Iran into the following document, once again in Igor Witkowski’s research:image [images/00085.jpg] Nazi Document Referring to the “Cascade Principle “ and Wideröe Radio ResonanceParticle Accelerators41 What some of the points in the document actually state are — from any standpoint— simply rather breathtaking:> Brief Report concerning the Works, which was performed by the undersigned and> his co-workers at the Institute for X-Ray-Related Natural and Raw Material> Research, since April 20, 1943, under the scope of the Research Directvie DE> 6224/0109/43.> ... > 13. Commission of a 15 million volt ray-transformer of the Wideröe model at> the Firm of C.H.F. Müller, Hamburg. > ... > 15. Scientific work of a theoretical nature concerning the propagation and> weakening of hardened X-rays in air under variable conditions, density and> temperature for various high primary energies. > ... > 17. Proposal for an installation for the manufacture of high voltage and large> current intensity according to the Cascade Principle as a basis of a single> DRP.42 Note the reference to a “ray-transformer” of “the Wideröe model” in point 13.Rolf Wideröe was a Norwegian physicist who had studied in Germany in the late1920s, and developed a radio resonance particle accelerator, or“ray-transformer” as the Germans called it. Indeed, particle accelerators andcyclotrons of almost every type then in existence were in fact built and used bythe Germans during the Third Reich.But the last point, point number 17, is the really significant point, for itmentions the “Cascade Principle” explicitly in connection with “an installation”for “the manufacture of high voltage and large current intensity.” Why is thisso significant? It is significant because this is a clear documentary clue thatthe Germans were indeed working on lasers, and very large ones at that, duringthe war. The reason why is because the “Cascade Principle” is the very principlethat lasers employ to cohere light into a non-diverging beam. But what were theGermans possibly going to do with such lasers?One answer is implicit in the document itself under point 15: they wereattempting to develop X-ray lasers, and to study the propagation of such beamsunder various atmospheric conditions. In other words, they were researching itas a weapon. But the other possibility is that they were developingsecond-generation tunable gas-dynamic lasers for the purposes of separatingultra-pure isotopes for their nuclear energy and weapons program.43 The need for“installations” of high voltage and current would be necessary for bothapplications.In other words, the laser may have a very hidden and secret history, andinterestingly enough, while Colonel Corso ostensibly was directing everyone’sattention to an extraterrestrial explanation of it, he was also subtly pointinga finger to Nazi Germany, and to wholly terrestrial science.5. TRANSISTORS AND INTEGRATED CIRCUITS Corso also mentions that the transistor and the integrated circuit were amongthe recovered “extraterrestrial debris” at Roswell. But as I pointed out in TheSS Brotherhood of the Bell, one only has to consider two pictures to see thatthe assumed extraterrestrial origins of the transistor is a completefabrication, as well as might be its more well-known public history:image [images/00086.jpg] German Klystron Tube ca. 1940-1941produced by the firm of Telefunken The pictured tube is about as big as the last knuckle on the reader’s littlefinger...but the British and American equivalent of this tube at the end of thewar was ten times larger!How was such miniaturization possible?One necessary component in the technology tree of the transistor are preciselysemiconductors.But here again, there is very bad Nazi news:image [images/00087.jpg] German Semi-conductor Chips The above picture of German semi-conductor wafers was taken by Americanintelligence investigators after the war.Of course, transistors are a long way from actual integrated circuits, becauseyet another necessary component in the technology tree toward the constructionof such integrated circuits is, of course, the electron microscope.Here again, however, there is more bad news, as the picture on the followingpage reveals.image [images/00088.jpg] German Electron Microscope from the 1930’s, Built by the A.E.G. Company44 In other words, all the basic components of the technology tree for thedevelopment of fully integrated circuits were in place inside of Nazi Germany.While there is no direct evidence known to this author as of this writing thatthere were any programs of development in place to do so, it is significant thatTom Agoston had this to say about the technology, and its origins in NaziGermany:> The full extent of this wartime transfer of Nazi secrets remains an unknown> quantity, as are the details of the patents exchanged between the two> nations(Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany). Just as the Nazi military technology> that wound up in U.S. and Soviet hands gave both nations a tremendous head> start in guided missiles and other fields, the German technology transfer to> Japan has provided that country with the core of its robotic and microchip> technology, much of it developed from German know-how and patents.45 That technology surely involved the three core technologies necessary to thedevelopment of integrated circuits in the technology tree: electronicsminiaturization, semiconductors, and electron microscopes.Consequently, yet another “extraterrestrial” technology alleged by Colonel Corsoto have been recovered from the Roswell Incident is found to have significant,if not entirely persuasive, Nazi antecedents.6. PORTABLE ATOMIC POWER FOR AIR- AND SPACE-CRAFT The final element in our list of Corso-Roswell “extraterrestrial” technologiesis that of nuclear powered aircraft and missiles, which would implyminiaturization of atomic reactors for aeronautic applications. We have alreadynoted that Agoston maintains that the ultimate purpose for Kammler’s “secretweapons think tank” was precisely to develop such technologies. For once,however, Agoston offers some rather startling corroboration, for> ...(It) was recently disclosed that one of the first top German engineers> cleared for urgent work for the U.S. Air Force in 1945 was Dr. Franz Josef> Neugebauer, a specialist in thermal systems for aircraft nuclear propulsion.46 Note that this would seem to imply that Nazi nuclear research was rather morecompetent and developed than the postwar “Allied Legend” would later maintain itwas.But there was another bombshell that Agoston dropped, and it was a doozie. Hereports that in 1948, a group of American nuclear scientists from its AtomicEnergy Commission was secretly exploring some of the underground installationsof Kammler’s “secret weapons think tank” empire in Germany. These scientistswere connected to a very secret program:> The hush-hush program was codenamed NEPA (Nuclear Energy Propulsion (for)> Aircraft), and was popularly referred to as the Lexington project. It had been> set up with a multi-million-dollar budget in the light of newly available> intelligence reports on the wartime work done by German scientists at Skoda,> the Junkers Aircraft factory at Dessau, and by other groups.... The project> was headed by Walter G. Whitman, head of the Department of Chemistry at the> Massachusetts Institute of Technology.47 In other words, one year after General Schulgen had composed his “IntelligenceCollection Memorandum,” in which he directed his agents to gather informationand intelligence on possibly nuclear-propelled saucers, the NEPA project isborn, and its scientists are secretly probing through the undergroundinstallations of the Kammler Group, presumably searching for clues into thewhole idea.So much for the legend of German wartime nuclear engineering incompetence!This is yet another fact to add to our now growing body of evidence thatsuggests that the American military-industrial-intelligence complex wasconsidering the possibility that they were faced, not with a Soviet threat, butwith one emanating from an independent postwar Nazi organization.It is one more example, not of a “recovered extraterrestrial technology” fromthe Roswell Incident, as Colonel Corso ostensibly argued in his book, but of aNazi one, to which, let it again be recalled, that he repeatedly pointed subtlefingers, for in all the instances examined above, there are either explicit Nazidevelopments of these technologies, or there are developments of crucialcomponents in their technology trees.C. THE LIFTING BODIES: A STAGED PROGRAM TOWARD FIELD PROPULSION All this brings us at last to the issue of the saucers themselves. What is knownabout them? And what conclusions about the Nazi research program, their design,and operation, may be drawn from what is known about them? Briefly stated, fromwhat little documentary evidence exists about these instruments, it may beconcluded that the Third Reich was attempting a staged program to acquireadvanced field propulsion craft, and that this staged program represented less aprogram of staged chronological development, but rather a program where eachdiscrete stage was designed to investigate certain theoretical and engineeringaspects of the problem, that is to say, it was a program of staged conceptualinvestigation and development.These stages may be divided into the following schematization for the sake ofthe analysis which follows:> 1) Mark I: the development of conventionally powered “saucers” wherein the jet> turbine or other conventional power supply is unconventionally configured> suction the boundary layer and to vector the exhaust thrust, theoretically> permitting high performance and a “hover” and vertical take-off and landing> capability (recall again Schulgen’s “Intelligence Collection Memorandum” in> this regard);> 2) Mark II: the development of such craft in conjunction with more exotic> technologies involving the ionizing of the surrounding atmosphere, and/or the> use of charge differentials to enhance lift efficiency and other operational> performance; such craft could include the development of nuclear powerplants;> 3) Mark III: the development of such craft in conjunction with exotic and> unconventional forms of propulsion using electromagnetic fields, plasmas, or> other genuinely “field propulsion” technologies. Each of these will now be examined more closely.1. MARK I: CONVENTIONALLY POWERED TURBINE SAUCERS OF UNUSUAL TURBINECONFIGURATION It will be recalled that both the Schulgen “Intelligence Collection Memorandum”and General Nathan Twining’s subsequent memorandum to Schulgen mentioned that insome flying saucer reports of the day there was mention both of an exhausttrail, indicative of a conventional powerplant such as a jet or ramjet, and aroaring sound, both of which were reported in some cases of the high performanceconditions under which the saucers were operating. In other words both memorandaappear to have in mind precisely the “Mark I” type of craft outlined above.In this respect, there is evidence that the Nazis were thinking along suchlines. A CIA report dated 18 August 1953 contains the observation that “‘Flyingsaucers’ have been known to be an actuality since the possibility of theirconstruction was proven in plans drawn up by German engineers toward the end ofWorld War II.”48 A CIA report of 27 May 1954 is even more explicit, for it“suggested that Projekt Saucer resulted in three designs”:> “One, designed by Miethe, was a disk-shaped aircraft, 135 feet in diameter,> which did not rotate; another, designed by Habermohl and Schriever, consisted> of a large rotating ring, in the centre of which was a round, stationary cabin> for the crew.” The report does not describe the third design, but goes on to> confirm that when the Soviets occupied Prague, “the Germans destroyed every> trace of the ‘flying saucer’ project and nothing more was heard of Habermohl> and his assistants.” The report also states that in Breslau, the Soviets> managed to capture one of the saucers built by Miethe; and that Rudolph> Schriever had died recently in Bremen-Lehe, where he had been living since the> end of the war.49 All of these projects were turbine-based projects, with the turbine functioningessentially not only as the propulsion but the lift.Apparently the CIA was keenly interested in the subject of German saucers forthe same 18 August 1953 report, gives even more information:> Georg Klein, a German engineer, stated recently that though many people> believe the “flying saucers” to be a postwar development, they were actually> in the planning stage in German aircraft factories as early as 1941.> Klein said that he was an engineer in the Ministry of Speer (probably refers> to Albert Speer, who, in 1942, was Minister for Armament and Ammunition for> the Third Reich, and was present in Prague on 14 February 1945, at the first> experimental flight of a “flying saucer.”50Citing the same document, Harbinson notes that Klein stated that the machine“reached a height of about 40,000 feet at a speed” — here comes that magicalfigure again — “of approximately 1,250 mph.”51The one point that may be immediately concluded from this is that the CIA’sinterest would be quite understandable if our interpretation of the Twining andSchulgen memoranda given in a previous chapter is correct, namely, that the U.S.military and intelligence communities had quietly concluded the unthinkable, andthat they were dealing with an independent Nazi organization with access to suchtechnologies, one whose exact base of operations, moreover, was unknown to theUSA. As such, these CIA reports, which are based simply on foreign press reportsin newspapers and magazines, are another clue that the CIA was seeking by anyand all means to collect reports not just on flying saucers in general, but Naziachievements in particular.Stevens categorizes these reports and their sources in the following fasion:> Categories of sources, in a somewhat descending order of reliability are:> 1. Those actually involved with these projects.> 2. Witnesses of flying saucers who had prior knowledge that the sighting was> of a German saucer as opposed to an unidentified flying object.> 3. Those who at the time had good reason to know of German saucers.> 4. Third-party intelligence sources which verify claims made by the higher> categories above.> 5. Researchers who have interviewed principals involved in German saucer> research.> 6. Studies or scientific papers published by individuals identified as> participants in these projects.52One has only to glance at the vast list of sources and articles falling intothese categories that are produced in both Stevens’ and Harbinson’s books53 torealize that by comparison to the Roswell Incident and its rather threadbarecatalogue of witnesses, the Nazi “saucer” story is flush with witnesses. Thisraises a rather interesting philosophical point, for many in the UFO and Roswellresearch communities would have us believe in the extraterrestrialinterpretation on the testimony of fewer witnesses and even less persuasiveargumentation than is given in Stevens’ or Harbinson’s books, or as has beenargued in the present work, while simultaneously they would have us disbelieveany Nazi connection, when, as is by now evident, there is far more in its favor,both in the documents, and as regards to the terrestrial nature of the debrisand the bodies. And in the instance of the bodies, let it be recalled, one wasdealing with second-hand and dead man’s testimony to boot! In so far as thoseresearchers do mention any Nazi connection, they never bother to fully explorethe options, mentioning merely V-2s and Horten wings, as if that covered thefull range of available options!54In any case, one of those sources who alleged that he was involved in the Nazisaucer projects of the Mark I variety was the elderly German engineer JohannAndreas Epp, who even published a book in Germany on the subject. According toStevens.> ...Epp has always maintained that it was he who originated the type of design> used in the Schriever-Hebermohl project. He states in his book that the> imbalance in the ring of the wing-vanes which plagued the early> Shriever-Habermohl prototypes was a deviation from his original design in> which the wing-vanes were lengthened. He states that when they returned to his> original design, the saucer was able to take off.... > ... > Therefore, the history of the Schriever-Habermorhl project in Prague can be> summarized as follows: Epp’s statement is that it was his design and model> which formed the basis for this project. This model was given to General Ernst> Udet which was then forwarded to Dr. Walter Dornberger at Peenemünde.55 Dr.> Dornberger tested and recommended the design which was confirmed by Dornberger> to Epp after the war. A facility was set up in Prague for further development> and the Schriever-Habermohl team was assigned to work on it there. At first> this project was under the auspices of Hermann Goering and the Luftwaffe.> Sometime later the Speer Ministry took over the running of this project with> the chief engineer Georg Klein in charge. Finally, the project was usurped by> the SS in 1944, along with other saucer projects, and fell under the purview> of Dr. Hans Kammler.56 But prior to the incorporation of these saucer projects into the SS and intoKammler’s “think tank,” there was a connection to the secret rocket researchcenter at Peenemünde, and therefore to Von Braun, Arthur Rudolph, Dr. Kurt Debusand all the other later Paperclip Nazis.The Peenemünde connection is important, for it exhibits the fact that with thesesaucers we are still dealing with the Mark I version, and with the specificconcepts that it was designed to investigate and exploit. Stevens explains itthis way: The Germans, he says, initially proposed to deal with the boundarylayer problem by using wings that would suction it off:> The literature on German efforts toward elimination of the boundary layer> using suction wings is voluminous, as Vesco has pointed out. Beginning in the> early 1940s German designers cut slots into experimental aircraft and> auxiliary engines were employed to suck in the boundary layer through the wing> itself and redirect this air into the fuselage and out the rear of the> aircraft. This proved to be more complicated than first anticipated. It was> found that the area of turbulence, eddy currents caused by the boundary layer,> moved across the wing from front to back as air speed increased. A slot at one> position on the wing might work at one speed but not another. This meant that> many, many slots covering the expanse of the wing would be needed to totally> defeat this boundary layer problem. This proved impractical for a number of> reasons.> One reason this was so was that multiple engines had to be used. The first> engine had to provide power for flight as in any airplane. The second engine,> mounted in the fuselage, was necessary to draw in air through the slotted> wings and exhaust it towards the rear. Interestingly enough, it was found that> the boundary layer could be eliminated by “sucking it in” or by “blowing it> off” using a strong flow of air to disrupt it.57Once again, the statements of General Schulgen’s “Intelligence CollectionMemorandum” spring to mind, and in doing so, point the finger once again to NaziGermany’s technologies and concepts, thus making it even more persuasive thatthe U.S. Air Force was concerned not so much with postwar Soviet developments,but postwar Nazi ones.But there is more:> Full scale suction wing aircraft were built for purposes of testing this> concept. These were the Junkers “Absaugeflugzeug” (suction aircraft) AF-1 and> the Fieseler “Absaugestorch” (Suction-stork) AF-2.> Concurrent with these experiments, work was being done into the feasibility of> circular wings. This work also began in the 1930s with the basic ideas being> credited to Professor Ludwig Prandtl. Early scientific papers on circular> winged aircraft were written beginning in 1936 by Wilhelm Kinner and in 1938> by M. Hansen. Both of these scientists worked at the Aerodynamic Research> Facility at Goettingen. By 1941 Dr. Alexander Lippisch was also engaged in> experimentation on circular wings at the Messerschmitt firm. His design,> designated J1253, was tested at the wind-tunnel in Goettingen. Dr. Lippisch> was visited by Dr. Giueseppe Belluzzo while at Messerschmitt in Augsburg and> Lippisch worked together with Dr. F. Ringlib on a “Drehfluegel” or “rotating> wing” which was tested at Peenemünde. As with suction wings, a body of> scientific literature from those times documents this early circular-wing> experimentation.> The genius of the German designers was to combine the ideas of suction(of the> boundary layer) and circular wings into a single aircraft. Housing the> complete aircraft within its wing would eliminate the fuselage and so> eliminate an unnecessary, drag-causing structure.58This requires some commentary and analysis.Dr. Walter Lippisch was, of course, the designer of several supersonic ramjetpropelled aircraft for Nazi Germany, one of which was reportedly tested andwhich broke the sound barrier for the first time prior to the end of the war.59Additionally, he was one of the Paperclip scientists brought to this country,and stationed at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, thus making him a prime candidatefor one of those “interrogated” individuals referred to in General NathanTwining’s memorandum to General Schulgen! Note now, however, that Lippisch isone of those involved with the Pennemünde group in the production and testing ofthese very unconventional aircraft. For Lippisch to be thus interrogated by theAmericans after the Roswell Incident is to suggest that what crashed was notonly something Nazi, but that the extent of American knowledge of these projectswas somewhat limited, and moreover suggests that the Nazi Paperclip scientistsgave out only as much information as needed to satisfy American inquiries. Thatthe Americans were not completely satisfied is evident by the fact that theydetermined to do further intelligence collection on the matter, which, as isevident from the CIA documents cited earlier, continued for a number of yearsafter the Roswell Incident.At this juncture, yet another German engineer, Heinrich Fleissner, enters thepicture with an American patent based on his own designs for a suction saucerundertaken at Peenemünde in conjunction with the foregoing projects. Notably,Fleissner’s American patent version of concepts he was engaged with in the ThirdReich was taken out a decade and a half later, in 1960! The cover-pages of thispatent, U.S. Patent Number 2,939,648, are revealing in themselves:image [images/00089.jpg] Fleissner U.S. Patent # 2,939,648, “Rotating Jet Aircraft with Lifting Disc Wingand Centrifuging Tanks “, Overhead and Frontal Views image [images/00090.jpg] Fleissenr U.S. Patent # 2,939,647, “Rotating Jet Aircraft with Lifting Disc Wingand Centrifuging Tanks”, Rear View and Electrical Schematic60 In an article for the May 1980 issue of the German publication Neue Presse,Fleissner described his work at Peenemünde. It is worth citing Stevensextensively on that work:> Fleissner was an engineer, designer and advisor to what he calls a> “Flugscheibe” project based at Peenemünde during the war. It is interesting to> note that Fleissner’s area of expertise, fluidics, is exactly the specialty> involved in investigating problems with boundary layer flow. Fleissner reports> that the saucer with which he was involved would have been capable of speeds> up to 3,000 kilometers per hour within the earth’s atmosphere, and up to> 10,000 kilometers outside the earth’s atmosphere. (Or to put it differently and more directly, Fleissner’s flying saucer projectat Peenemünde was for the purpose of developing a manned space vehicle ofsaucer-shaped configuration! Continuing with Stevens:)> He states that the brains of the developmental people were found in Peenemünde> under the tightest of secrecy. (And this means that there are, at Peenemünde itself, two programs, a “secret”one involving Von Braun and his rocket team, and another “much more secret” oneinvolving very unconventional manned aircraft!)> ...(What is of most interest to us here are three facts. First, that Fleissner> worked at Peenemünde on a flying saucer project. Second, that a hint of this> design has survived to this day.61 Third, the surviving design can be linked> to photographic evidence of a German saucer, circa World War Two.62 Note the tripod landing gear in the diagrams of Fleissner’s American patent,which means that the design was intended for vertical take-off and landing.So how did the Fleissner design, or rather, the Peenemünde design on which thesubsequent Fleissner U.S. patent was based, work?> The engine employed by Fleissner rotated around the cabin on the outside of> the saucer disc itself. It was set in motion by starter rockets... (This)> engine was really a form of ram-jet engine. It featured slots running around> the periphery of the saucer into which air was scooped. The slots continued> obliquely right through the saucer disc so that jet thrust was aimed slightly> downward and backward from the direction of rotation. Within the slots, fuel> injectors and a timed ignition insured a proper power curve which as in> accordance with the speed and direction of the saucer much like an> automobile’s fuel injection is timed to match the firing of the spark plugs.> Steering was accomplished by directing the airflow using internal channels> containing a rudder and flaps which ran alongside of the central cabin. The> cabin itself was held stationary or turned in the desired direction of flight> using a system of electromagnets and servo-motors coupled with a gyroscope.> It is interesting to note that while the patent was filed on March 28, 1955,> it was not granted until June 7, 1960, over five years later! What could> possibly have been the reason for the delay? The only possible reason concerns> the American Silver Bug Project which was being developed at the same time.> This was a project which was tasked with further development of the Miethe> design or an outgrowth of it and simply referred to as a “radial jet engine.”> But we now know this Meithe project was not the equal of the Peenemünde> project in terms of speed. The Americans must have realized this sometime> after the filing of Fleissner’s patent. There can be little doubt that the> reason for the delay of the Fleissner patent was the evaluation and possibly> the pirating of his design by the Americans. At about the same moment that> Fleissner’s patent was granted, it was announced that the joint> Canadian-American saucer project, Silver Bug and its derivatives, had been> abandoned by those governments. The only possible reason for this abandoning> was that they had found something better, and the better design, by far, was> Fleissner’s.63Stevens also observes that the Fleissner patent makes it clear that the vehiclewas designed for the capability of using a variety of fuels, including theclassic rockets fuels of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. As such, it wasintentionally designed as a suction-craft for inside the atmosphere operations,and as an oddly configured rocket for operations outside of it.64One may therefore regard these different versions of the “Mark I” German suctionsaucers as engineering studies in the problems associated with suctioning of theboundary layer, the vectoring of exhaust thrust, the difficulties andrequirements of jet-propelled vertical take-off and landing, and finally, withthe problem of creating a technology that was adaptable to the requirements ofendo- and exo-atmospheric flight, i.e., as a second-generation mannedspace-flight technology.2. MARK II: THE EXTENSION OF MARK I CRAFT BY THE USE OF CONVENTIONALTECHNOLOGIES IN EXOTIC COMBINATIONS, OR BY EXOTIC TECHNOLOGIES THEMSELVES INCOMBINATION WITH CONVENTIONAL ONES. The next concept to be investigated was the extension of range and otherperformance characteristics by whatever means was conceivable to do so. Thisincluded, of course, the development of practical nuclear powerplants,65 methodsionizing the atmosphere of surrounding aircraft, and to more interesting andsuperficially “conventional” solutions. One of these involved the proposal tofind a way to cool atmospheric nitrogen as the craft moved through the air, andthen to burn it through extremely high voltage discharges. By thus relying onthe principal element within the atmosphere itself, nitrogen, the range of thecraft could, as with atomic propulsion, be almost limitless. “A saucer whichcould gather its fuel along the way has one obvious advantage. It could stayaloft for days if not weeks.”663. MARK III: FIELD PROPULSION CRAFT This brings us at last to the always-thorny and difficult subject of actual Nazifield propulsion saucers. The difficulty of this subject has been very aptlysummarized by Stevens:> The existence of World War Two German field propulsion flying saucers is a> topic which is denied by virtually every reputable authority in aviation> history. It is also denied by many researchers actually studying German> saucers. The problem is that in the years immediately following the Second> World War the earth’s skies suddenly began to be populated by flying craft> which did some remarkable things. They flew at unheard of speeds. They made> very sharp turns, seemingly non-aerodynamic turns, even at this extreme speed.> They lacked the glowing tail of jets or rockets but they glowed or gave off> light at night from their periphery or from the whole craft. They were silent> or almost silent. Sometimes they gave off sounds that an electric generator or> motor might make. Sometimes vehicles with electrically based ignition systems> ceased to operate in the presence of these saucers. No government claimed> these flying craft, yet they were seen all over the world.67 The problem was not aided by the fact that some postwar neo-Nazi sourcespublished schematics and diagrams of alleged Nazi field propulsion saucers suchas the “Hannebu” and “Vril” saucers, along with dubious explanations of theirpropulsive systems.But there was evidence that something along field propulsion lines was in factafoot within the Third Reich during the war. In addition to the Nazi Bellproject which clearly had field propulsion implications, there are otherindicators. Stevens, for example, cites a Combined Intelligence ObjectivesSub-Committee report that refers to the work of one Dr. Otto Erb, whose work,among other things, included an “apparatus for (the) conversion of residual heatinto electrical energy,... an apparatus for turning the energy of the sun’s raysinto electrical energy” but most importantly, an apparatus for “rearward impulsepropulsion of vehicles and aircraft.”68Stevens’ comment concerning this last item is worth citing in full:> Of course by now many readers will have already...grasped the significance of> ... “Rearward impulse propulsion for vehicles and aircraft.” Given the nature> of Dr. Erb’s other work, it is a safe bet that this “impulse propulsion” was> not of the jet or rocket nature. In fact there remains little doubt that this> propulsion was, in fact, field propulsion... if this is not the smoking gun> for German experiments in field propulsion saucers, it is at least a hint that> there is a gun.69 If that is the case, then it is even truer to say the same of the Nazi Bell. Oneneed look no farther than that project to sense the immediate implications ithas for the topic of field propulsion research and its connection to NaziGermany.There are, however, other clues than these. In an intelligence document entitled“An Evaluation of German Capabilities in 1945” prepared for the headquarters ofthe United States Strategic Air Forces inEurope, a curious and brief section entitled “Magnetic Wave” states thefollowing:> The best information available is from very secret and reliable sources, and> forces the conclusion that this weapon exists as a possibility. It is designed> to cause failure of various electrical apparatus in aircraft. Technically it> does not appear to be a possible serious threat in 1945. At most it would be> effective at a few locations for preventing ground strafing. Evidence to date> indicates that it could have little effect against high level attack, since> the apparatus would be too cumbersome to permit its use in aircraft.70 The mention of “magnetic waves” however, opens up an entirely new Pandora’s Box,for it will be recalled that this was the principle alleged to be in operationin the Roswell craft by Colonel Corso, a principle reminiscent, moreover, of Dr.Kurt Debus’ idea of “magnetic fields separation.”With the German research into magnetism, however, we are once again chin to chinwith some rather astounding developments. Nothing better epitomizes this Naziobsession with magnetism and “magnetic fields separation” better than theso-called Schappeller Device, named after its inventor Karl Schappeller. Theschematic of the device is relatively simple:image [images/00091.jpg] Schematic of the Schappeller Device. Note the Electrical Connection of theDevice to the Earth71 But while the schematic is simple, its operation, and Schapeller’srationalization for the device, are not. While I have briefly outlined thisdevice in a previous book,72 it is now necessary to be more detailed in order toshow its field propulsion implications and its clear and explicit relationshipto the Nazi Bell project, and to Dr. Debus’s conception of “magnetic fieldsseparation.” I will rely heavily upon Stevens’ presentation in order todemonstrate this relationship.Like most electrical motors, Schappeller’s device is composed of two basiccomponents, a rotor and a stator. In this case, the stator is a ball, which inturn is divided into two halves, each of which contain the internal mechanismsof the device. Both halves of the stator are air-tight. At the poles of each ofthese hemispheres are iron bar magnets; most of these magnets are on the insideof each hemisphere. At the very center of the device, and therefore of the twohemispheres, there is a gap or space between the two magnets. Then things get alittle more interesting:> Insulation, a ceramic material, is placed on the inside of the steel ball,> leaving a hollow central area. Within this hollow area and around the space> between the magnets are wound two internal coils. These originate at the bar> magnet poles and each terminates at the center of the sphere with a connection> leading out of the sphere to the rotor. These coils are composed of a hollow> copper tube filled with a special and secret substance called the “electret”.> Upon leaving the sphere the electret filled copper tubes are replaced by> conventional copper wire. An electrical connection is made from the outside> surface of one pole to one pole of a special type of battery which is grounded> at the other pole or, as an alternative, to a special device called an> “Ur-machine” which will be discussed.73 The word “electret” is composed from “electricity” and “magnet,” and is simply amaterial that is a dielectric, having either a semi-permanent static electricalcharge or — and this is quite important — a dipole polarization like an ordinarymagnet. The British physicist Oliver Heaviside coined the term. An electret isthus a peculiar kind of material, being more or less the “static electricity”equivalent of a permanent magnet. When this fact is born in mind, thenSchappeller, it will be noted, has maximized the dipole phenomenon in his deviceto the maximum degree, for even the “wires” on the inside of the device in thecoils are composed of an electret, whose composition Schappeller never publiclyrevealed.Prior to operation all air inside the spheres is sucked out,74 and the device isthen turned on:> The device is started through (a) totally unique battery and a connection to> the earth. A specific excitation impulse must be given to the device. This> electric impulse was conducted through the iron magnet and jumped the gap in> the center of the sphere to the other iron magnet.> What occurred then sets this device apart from all others. In the vacuum of> the sphere, in the center between the two bar magnets a field of “glowing> magnetism” was set up. This glowing magnetism was something entirely unique.> It is recognized as a magnetic field but much more powerful and unlike any> magnetic field of an iron bar or an electric coil. Once the initial input has> been made to start the device, the battery and ground could be disconnected.> The device would continue to operate on its own.> For an understanding of what is really happening here we have to consider the> bar magnet. We think of a bar of iron with two poles, one positive and one> negative or perhaps one north and one south pole. But there are really three> components to the bar magnet. There are the two poles and the neutral zone> between the poles. If we cut the magnet in half we get two new poles. For the> Schappeller (device) this neutral area is very important. Imagine a bar magnet> running through the vertical axis of the ball. Then imagine the center section> cut out. We now have a north pole at the top of the ball, a south pole at the> bottom of the ball, just as we do with the planet Earth. In the center we have> a missing section with a south pole, opposing the north pole at the top of the> ball and, likewise, a north pole opposite the south pole at the bottom of the> ball. We have now four poles and a split bar magnet in its center section.> It is this gap in the center where Schappelller’s “glowing magnetism” is> generated by grounding, that is, charging the device by a special battery and> an earth connection, This glowing magnetism is the mystery. Davson cites> Schappeller’s calculations and gives this form of magnetism as being one> thousand times more powerful than that produced by present magnetism. He also> states that in this form of magnetism the electricity is stationary while the> magnetism is radiated.75 Note that by so maximizing the dipoles in his device, and that by concentratingan electrical pulse in the gap between the two magnets, Schappeller hasbasically turned that magnetic neutral zone into a conventional spark gap, orrather, a conventional spark gap into a magnetic neutral zone. As the staticelectrical current from his electret passes through the gap, it pulses themagnetic neutral zone.The conceptual resemblance here to the Bell — at least in my own speculativereconstruction of the physics involved — is rather astounding, for not only doesSchappeller’s device involve static electrical pulse (basically, DC or directcurrent), but it embodies Debus’ principle of “magnetic fields separation.”Schappeller’s “glowing” or “radiant” magnetism is thus perhaps the very“magnetic wave” that was previously encountered in the American intelligence“Evaluation of German Capabilities in 1945.” It takes no great leap of theimagination to see direct implications in the Schappeller device for the idea offield propulsion. Even the fact that both devices employed ceramic material onlyemphasizes the strong conceptual resemblance between the two. Additionally, itwill be recalled that the Henge structure in which the Bell device was testedwas equipped with heavy duty electrical cabling ports, indicating an earth orground connection that was somehow important to the Bell’s operation.Stevens looks closely at this magnetic neutral zone and its central role inSchappeller’s conceptions. This “Magnetic Neutral Zone” exists inside anyordinary bar magnet, and is known as the Bloch Wall.> “This is a transition layer between adjacent ferromagnetic domains magnetized> in different directions. The wall has a finite thickness of a few hundred> lattice constants, as it is energetically preferable for the spin directions> to change slowly from one orientation to another, going through the wall> rather than to have an abrupt discontinuity.”> In electromagnetics the Bloch Wall is external to the hardware itself. it is> the point of division of the circulating vortex, or spin, of the electronic> magnetic energies of the north and south poles. The negative north pole> magnetism spins to the left while the positive south pole spins to the right.> Energy is being conducted into the Schappeller device through the un-insulated> poles and being conducted and spun on its way to the center of the unit. The> point of zero magnetism, no spin and magnetic reversal, where the two spin> fields join, is the Bloch Wall.76 By abruptly pulsing that Bloch Wall in his device, Schappeller was setting upthe conditions of an extreme “torsion shear” effect within the device, in amanner similar to the Nazi Bell (as I have rationalized the device).Schappeller was also ahead of his time — way ahead — in another way as well, forhe was an outspoken critic of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, a virtual“dogma” not only in the physics of that day, but down to our own times as well.Schappeller conceived of reality as a broken symmetry, and pointed to theexistence of life itself as a testimony that there was something very wrong withthe idea of entropy. Like the Russian astrophysicist Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev woulddo two decades later, Schappeller implied the disturbing question, “If there iscosmic entropy, where is it?” His device was a conceptual study of the conceptof a non-equilibrium system, and how it might, through magnetic fieldsseparation and torsion shear, access or transduce energies from that brokensymmetry.W.A. Harbinson notes that many UFO “close encounters” exhibit the signatures ofthis type of “torsion shear” on objects in their environment. In some reports, a“flying saucer”> can not only lift vehicles off the road, but ‘seems to impart a torque or> turning force to them, as confirmed by the spinning and swirling of other> objects.’ This phenomenon shows that the unknown force ‘prevails within a> cylindrical zone having the same diameter as the UFO and extending from it to> the ground.’ What is most puzzling about this force is that instead of acting> downward, as would be the case with jet exhausts, it acts upward, thus causing> rotation to the objects affected. The force is also selective in what it> affects, favouring electrical conductivity as a ‘responsive item.’ Thus, stone> or dry sticks are not so affected (unless wet); the human or animal body,> metals, and water are. This suggests that the UFO may indeed be defeating> gravity in some manner and, if so, is sharing this achievement with the> ‘responsive items’ directly below it, which in turn suggests ‘gravity damping> by electromagnetic radiation.’> More support for the presence of electromagnetic radiation comes from the> charred grass and plants often found where UFOs have landed. As the roots of> grass so affected are charred, but the blades are not damaged, it is possible> that we are dealing with induction heating from a ‘powerful alternating> magnetic field.’ This offers the possibility of microwave propulsion.77 These alternating magnetic fields and microwaves would account for manyphenomena associated with UFO close encounters, from the stoppage of internalcombustion engines, to “wild gyrations of compasses and magnetic speedometers,”interference with electronic broadcasting, the heating of bituminous highways tothe extent that they sometimes catch fire, the feeling of electrical shocksreported by some individuals in these situations, and even the “buzzing” soundsthat reportedly accompany some of these UFOs.78By now I believe the case is clear that, if the Germans did not actually fieldany prototypical field propulsion craft, they were most certainly working on thebasic concepts and technologies leading to them, and that they may have beenclose to doing to by the war’s end. It is clear that they were working on suchcraft utilizing conventional propulsion methods in unusual configurations. Itthus appears evident that their program was a program of investigation of anyand all concepts that could conceivably lead to breakthrough technologies foradvanced aerial and space capabilities.In an odd and ironic “coincidence” that is by now looking less and less“coincidental,” the Canadian magnetics engineer Wilbert Smith — in an episodewell known to ufologists — stated that when he discretely queried Americanauthorities in the early 1950s on the status and classification of the subjectmatter of UFOs, he received the astonishing reply that it was classified higherthan the hydrogen bomb.79 But this should not, by now, surprise us, for theNazis themselves had classified their “field propulsion” and “free energy”technology, the Bell, at a level much higher than their own atom bomb project.Perhaps, as American intelligence and military officials were slowly andsecretly waking up to what and who was confronting them, they classified thematter in similar fashion, and for similar reasons.D. THE NAZI SCENARIO1. THE RATIONALIZATION OF THE DOCUMENTS, BODIES, AND DEBRIS We have now reached the end of this study. As has been seen, the “independentNazi scenario” does make rational sense of all three major components of theRoswell Incident. It makes sense of the major authentic documents that canreasonably be associated with that Incident and it even makes sense of some ofthe disputed ones. It even sheds a new interpretive light on the possible rolesand motivations of some of those who have researched and written about theIncident. There is, one may argue, a sense of urgency in those intelligencecollection memoranda, as the U.S. Air Force evidently suspects the origin — muchto its disbelief and chagrin — but is determined to discover exactly where theywere coming from.It makes sense, too, of the data point of the bodies, for if one allows certaintestimonies of their existence for the sake of argument, then, as Nick Redferndemonstrated in his book, the features recorded for those bodies arerationalizable on a wholly terrestrial basis.But most importantly, the original core of the story, the extraordinary debris,has now been shown to suggest not only something genuinely extraordinary, butalso something genuinely terrestrial. In some cases the details and propertiesof that debris pointed directly to the type of materials engineering researchand fabrication that Nazi Germany was indeed pursuing. In others, a morespeculative and argued case was made that ended in the same place. But in thefinal analysis, those remarkable properties point to nothing in the sky, but tohidden technologies, projects, and ideas right here on earth.The documents, the bodies, and the debris, have now been fully rationalized upona terrestrial basis, and in the case of the documents and the debris, theindicators, if one has the eyes to see and the ears to hear them, are that theIncident was caused by something Nazi crashing in the New Mexico desert. Wouldthe U.S. military exhibit “extreme anxiety” and attempt to cover that up forpolitical and technological reasons? Absolutely.The Nazi scenario fully rationalizes the peculiar “Roswell dialectic” evident inthe Incident almost from the beginning, and explains it as an attempt to controlthe interpretations of the event, and to channel them into two mutually opposedand ultimately equally absurd interpretations, for self-evidently, Mogul orweather balloon debris does not explain the debris as described by thewitnesses. And equally absurd is the conclusion that the craft or its debrisrepresented something extraterrestrial, for nothing really is known of itsperformance characteristics nor its technologies beyond what has been describedfor the debris. To fall back on the wider ufological context is itself perilousto that interpretation, for while many of those reports described extremeperformance for the period, none of them seem to this author exotic enough tocompel toward the conclusion that they — or the Roswell Incident — can only beexplained by the conclusion that its origin was ultimately off this world.2. THE WIDER HISTORICAL CONTEXT However, ufologists are not to be faulted for seeking to place theirextraterrestrial interpretations of the Roswell Incident into the widerufological context of the period. This is a natural and rational step given theparadigm by which they interpret the event. Similarly, it is a rational andnatural step to seek to place a Nazi interpretation of the Incident into asimilar context. We have implied throughout this book that the Nazi scenariomakes sense in a wider context that includes a kind of postwar “Paperclipdetente” that was struck between elements of the Anglo-American oligarchic eliteand elements of that surviving postwar Nazi International. It makes sense of thegrowing suspicions of many researchers who have followed the subject, that thereis a kind of “two space programs” agenda being pursued, a public one, and a muchmore secret one. As is now evident, the genesis of that idea, historically, wascentered at the secret Nazi research center at Peenemünde itself, with the“public-secret” program of Von Braun and his rocket team, and the “secretsecret” saucer programs of Fleissner, Epp, and others also being headquarteredthere. And straddling the fence between those two and the Nazi Bell itself, isDr. Kurt Debus. The Nazi scenario makes sense of the subsequent silencing of theanti-gravity topic in the mid-1950s just as well as does any extraterrestrialhypothesis, for faced with an enemy that was terrestrial and that hadself-evident access to such technologies, the American military’s response wouldhave been a crash program to acquire it for itself. It makes sense even of thecovert “space” and “UFO wars” that so many have noticed began to be wagedbetween the American military and “whomever,” and makes sense of it without theabsurd suggestion that the American military was willing to risk aninterplanetary war with people that, by the nature of that case, possessed atechnological capability far beyond our own, and brings it back to earth and tothe suggestion that while “they” possessed an advanced technology, it was not sofar beyond our own that it invited risk to the national security.There is one final detail to this scenario, and two loose ends, that must now bementioned.In my previous books I have argued that, as the Second World War drew to itsend, the Nazi leadership itself began a strategic evacuation plan that includedas a principal feature of its planning the more or less equal division of itsless sensational technological spoils between the Western Allies and the SovietUnion, while retaining the best, most advanced, and most radical of thosetechnologies for itself for its own independent postwar development andexploitation.And that brings us to the two loose ends: the “Czech Incident” of 1946, and onceagain to Antarctica, and to “Alternative Two.”3. THE CZECH INCIDENT REVISITED In 1946, a team of American commandos surreptitiously entered Czechoslovakia forthe ostensible purpose of recovering some six tons of documents that werenecessary for the war crimes tribunals then taking place in occupied westernGermany.80 But as a close examination of American documents concerning thatincident quickly reveal, the war crimes tribunal story was just a cover, for theCzech government protested that the commando team was simply trying to stealradar secrets and other technological data that had been buried by the SSsomewhere in the environs of Prague. Even more tellingly, the American documentsconcerning the incident also contained the puzzling fact that no one within theAmerican State Department or War Department could figure out just exactly whogave the orders for the incursion in the first place. There was genuinemystification. Perhaps one was dealing with one of the “pirate intelligenceteams” that so concerned General Eisenhower prior to the invasion of France.Or....perhaps one might have been dealing with a team of German SS commandosdressed up like Americans and rescuing their own documents, and pinning theblame on America in a classic false flag operation.Henry Stevens also imparts one more bit of information, for it is now believedthat, if the Americans were behind the commando incursion — and Stevens believesthey most definitely were — then they did not get everything, for some 2.5 tons“of archival material remain under the control of former SS members and arestill intact.”81 Given all that we have encountered in previous pages, it is asafe bet that the missing 2.5 tons of documents contained information about theNazi atomic program, nuclear propulsion program, its saucers, and, of course,the Bell project.4. ALTERNATIVE TWO: ANTARCTICA REVISITED. The other loose end is Antarctica. “Nazi UFO” proponents have long asserted —without much in the way of argumentation — that during the War a secret researchbase, a veritable city, of Nazi technicians, engineers, and scientists wasconstructed in Antarctica. This base, so the legend runs, continued conductingthe most advanced Nazi research, and, utilizing Nazi flying saucers, dealt adecisive defeat to Admiral Byrd and his Operation Highjump expedition in early1947. (There’s that year again!) While I have mentioned all of this in Reich ofthe Black Sun, I have long argued in public appearances and radio interviewsthat the construction of such a research base would have been a logisticalimpossibility for the German Navy during World War Two. The Nazis may andprobably did have some weather station and small U-boat base there, but anextensive research facility able to manufacture such craft?Ausgeschlossen!But once again, Henry Stevens has, as he so often does, dug much deeper, only touncover a much deeper mystery.> Geologically speaking, Antarctica is almost split in half by a huge rift> valley, which runs from the South Pole toward Africa, then up East Africa to> the Dead Sea. This entire rift valley is overflowing with geothermal activity.> It was on this very rift valley that the Germans located their Antarctic base.> Hot water ponds, named the Schumacher Ponds by the Germans, are teaming with> algae, and found on surface rock deep within Antarctica. These ponds never> freeze over. Interestingly enough, each pond is populated by a different> species of algae, giving each pond a different color. It is not far-fetched to> believe taht a sustainable base could be located over one of these geothermal> vents, especially deep within a large crevice or cave.... (The) Icelanders> rely on geothermal energy to produce electricity for their daily needs. Why> could not have inhabitants of Antarctica?82 Adding to the strangeness, Stevens reports that an anonymous letter was sent tothe journal Scientific American in which a curious incident was alleged to haveoccurred in Antarctica. Two Australian women were attempting tocross-country-ski over Antarctica when they were seized by American Navy specialforces, and detained.83The detention may have something to do, argues Stevens, with all the strangesecrecy that the United States shows towards Lake Vostok, a vast undergroundthermal lake in the Antarctic interior, covered with an ice dome that, duringthe endless day of the Antarctic summer, admits enough sunlight to bathe thelake in an endless twilight glow of light coming through the ice dome.84 But whywas no less than the American National Security Agency involved? Stevensmaintains that it is because it may be because Admiral Byrd and the Nazis mayhave found or discovered something there during their 1938 and 1947 fly-oversand photoreconnaissance of the continent.85This may very well be the truth, for there is a huge magnetic anomaly on thesouthwestern shore of Lake Vostok, registering some “1,000 nanoteslas ofvariance with the surrounding vicinity.”86 This might be due, as Stevens argues,to the presence of a vast amount of metal, “Metal as in a buried city.”87Or perhaps a genuine geophysical anomaly? Or a buried “something else?” Or somecombination of all three? We will never know.But the evidence, Stevens argued, points to something artificial, and somethingmoreover under intelligent control. Consider, he says, the following Antarcticseismographs. These readings were taken from the American station at theAmundsen South Pole station, whose seismometers are located in such a fashionthat they are “surrounding the old German area called Neuschwabenland.”88 Thefirst graph is that of a typical “all quiet on the Antarctic front” sort of day.image [images/00092.jpg] “All Quiet on the Antarctic Front”8 And, here is what an Antarctic earthquake looks like:image [images/00093.jpg] Typical Antarctic Earthquake Seismogram90 But then there appears to be, according to Stevens, highly anomalous, i.e., notnaturally-caused, standing long-wave activity, when the needles are all over thechart in what is definitely not an earthquake, nor, for that matter, anexplosion of any sort:image [images/00094.jpg] “Not So Quiet on the Antarctic Front”: Standing Long Waves, a Scalar WeaponSignature?91 As if that were not enough, then there are signatures both of these standinglong waves, and of small, sharp anomalies that would be typical of the seismicsignatures of nuclear detonations:image [images/00095.jpg] “Open War on the Antarctic Front”: Standing Long Wave Activity Accompanied by“Detonation” Signatures.92 Stevens cites the research of German seismic researcher Christian Saal, who“interprets this to be an American attack on Neuschwabenland using the newboring atomic weapon announced at the time of the Iraq invasion.” Moreover,adding credence to this idea, the date on the first seismograph at the top ofthis page is 3/20/03, “the very day the United States began its massivebombardment of Baghdad.” Saal maintains that while the world’s attention wasdiverted to Iraq, the U.S.A. used “bunker-busting” atom bombs to attack the Nazibase.93The defense, according to Saal, apparently held, because there was a second such“attack” launched, as is “demonstrated” by the second seismogram. Stevens, ofcourse, is much more skeptical, though concedes the overall importance of theseismograms:> I really don’t know if Christian Saal’s interpretation is correct or not. What> is most important to me is that there is real data here that shows something> unusual and unexplained by “the authorities”. This hard seismological data, an> acknowledged mystery lake in the center of Antarctica, and the interjection of> the National Security Agency all point to something as yet unexplained> happening on our southern-most continent.94 Whether or not the current activity has anything whatsoever to do with Nazis ortheir nefarious schemes is, in a certain sense, not even important, for it seemshardly coincidental that they would have chosen to explore precisely this area,nor coincidental that they also researched the very technologies of standinglong waves evidenced in the seismograms.But whether these seismic anomalies point to secret buried cities, to a flyingsaucer long ago buried under the Antarctic ice, or to geophysical processesunderstood by but a few, or to some combination of any of these, one factremains, and that is, within the wider context of Nazi saucer research and allthe other exotic technologies that remained in their hands after the war,perhaps, after all, there might be a kernel of truth in the old mythologies ofthe Last Nazi Battalion, Antarctica, and secret saucer bases.In any case, we know now that the Roswell Incident was not a silly balloon. Andwe know it was not extraterrestrial either. It was in all likelihood, somethingNazi, an enemy fighter that, as Admiral Byrd put it to the Chilean newspaper ElMercurio earlier that year in 1947, “could fly from pole to pole with tremendousspeed.”And the United States, he advised, had best get busy and start preparing todefend itself.And that is what the record shows that it did.image [images/00003.jpg] 1 W.A.

If Major Marcel was induced tothe extraterrestrial conclusion by the Roswell researchers, then it should benoted that one of those who was in contact with Marcel was precisely Bill Moore.However, let it be noted that Marcel, in his interview as reported in Berlitz’sand Moore’s The Roswell Incident, falls short of drawing this explicitconclusion which he later drew. He states merely that he did not know where itcame from. Irving Newton maintains that Marcel, during his appearance in FortWorth in 1947, quietly was trying to persuade Newton that the figures and debrisrepresented something “extraterrestrial,” but this detail does not emerge in thesecond or third articulations of the story of the Incident, but only much later.The possibility must therefore be entertained that this might represent anorchestrated attempt to discredit Marcel’s observations.12 Cited in Farrell, Reich of the Black Sun, p. 293.13 Henry Stevens, Hitler’s Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons, Science, andTechnology (Kempton, Illinois: Adventures Unlimited Press, 2007), p. 122.14 Stevens, Hitler’s Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons, Science, andTechnology, p. 123.

Oddly enough, the idea of a crystal explosive of great powerfinds expression in the recent movie Eagle Eye. The idea of extreme cooling andsuper-compression and hardening is, of course, the basic idea behind a neutronstar. The idea runs as follows: as the hydrogen of a spent star is subjected tothe near-absolute-zero of space, it cools, and eventually the electron of theatom collapses into the proton, creating a neutron. As more and more atomsundergo this process, a kind of “neutron material” results that is composed ofnothing but neutrons. Being compressed further together would create theultimate diamagnetic “metal” of ultra-extreme heaviness, density, and hardness.It will be recalled that the Japanese military attaché at Stockholm learned, in1943, of some sort of German research into such areas, and informed Tokyo ofthis (See my Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 43-46.)21 British Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee report number 142 (BryanstonSquare, London).
