Hoagland for contributions to thisbook. In this case, unbeknownst to Mr. Hoagland, I had determined to write abook on this subject a couple of years ago, and in one of those synchronicitiesthat seem to be a common feature of modern life, while listening to one of hispresentations at a conference, a source for research, utilized and cited herein,was mentioned. Needless to say, I quickly jotted down the reference, andeventually, when I purchased the book, found it to be a goldmine of informationand thought-provoking ideas. The book was astrologist Robert Gover’s Time andMoney: The Economy and the Planets, and notwithstanding the short review of itin the main text, it is in itself a book worth considering in its totality forthose interested in the more esoteric aspects of economic forecasting andactivity.Mr. Hoagland also played another role in the formation of this book, and again,it was one that at the time he didn’t realize he was playing. During a visit tohis home in 2008, Mr. Hoagland showed me volumes of data in his library that hadbeen collected and analyzed by the little-known Foundation for the Study ofCycles. We had some stimulating conversation over these materials, not the leastof which were their implications for the connection between physics and finance.In due course I set off researching the availability of some of this material,and eventually was able to purchase the classic text Cycles: The Science ofPrediction by the Foundation’s founder, economist Edward Dewey.In researching this book, I quickly discovered that the materials to documentthe main themes were so numerous and varied that any attempt atcomprehensiveness was futile. Notwithstanding that, a word of thanks is due toall those inventors and scientists who have seen their discoveries and theoriesshuffled to the sidelines by a “corporautocracy” that is hell-bent on keepinghumanity in the slavery of an energy and financial dark ages: to all the Teslas,Farnsworths, Kozyrevs, Müllers, Richters, DiPalmas, Bedinis, and Beardens outthere: thank you. I only regret that I couldn’t mention you all, but restassured, your work and its implications were noticed.And to all the other researchers out there who have contributed to unmasking thesinister role of private banking in the affairs of state and of mankindthroughout history: thank you. Again, it was not for the dearth but the surfeitof information that specific mention could only be made of a few of you.And with that, on to the story…Joseph P.

CONFRONTING THE BEAST“Modern fiat money and reserve banking is indeed a manifestation of thetransmutative ‘nothingness’ of the Philosophers’ Stone, for from the creation ofcredit out of nothing, gold is produced.” By nationalizing that money andcredit-creating institution “and wresting it from private, secretive hands, andusing it to fund the alchemical physics it was beginning to develop as theultimate energy source, as the ultimate power to transport mankind, and as theultimate power for destruction on a doomsday scale, the Nazis indicated thatthey had understood the nature of the (Philosophers’) Stone. They had seen, andfully understood, the connection between alchemical physics, and alchemicalfinance. And they were willing to put it to supremely evil uses.“But that connection between alchemical physics and alchemical finance is,perhaps, a relationship that requires its own exposition….“Epilogue is Prologue…”Thus did I write at the conclusion of my book The Philosophers’ Stone: Alchemyand the Secret Research for Exotic Matter.2 [4372.xhtml#3332] The reader mayhave inferred from these quoted remarks that there was much more of the story —both from the standpoint of physics and finance, and from that of history — totell, and that it would require yet another study or book to do so. If thereader made such inferences, he is correct on both counts: there is much more ofthe story of the relationship between physics and finance to tell.The thesis of this book is both simple to state, and difficult to understand,and that is that, since ancient times and with more or less uninterruptedconstancy, there has existed an international money power which seeks by avariety of means — including fraud, deception, assassination, and war — to usurpthe money- and credit-creating power of the various states it has sought todominate, and to obfuscate and occult the profound connection between thatmoney-creating power and the deep “alchemical physics” that such power implies.Accordingly, I do not argue that case comprehensively in this book, since to doso would require an extended series of books, each devoted to a particularhistorical period, and each burying the reader in a blizzard of footnotes to theextent that the main thesis would itself become obscured. Rather, I assume thismodel as a given, as an interpretive paradigm by which to view certain eventsand data. In so doing, that case is indeed argued, but in synoptic form ratherthan comprehensively. In doing so, I hope to keep before the reader’s attentionthat deep and profound connection between physics and finance and to show why itis that the private and international money power must always seek to suppressnot only certain types of state financial policy, but also certain types ofphysics, for both indeed spring from a common conceptual root.Most of my books, as readers familiar with them already know, inhabit a strangeregion where alternative physics interfaces with history to reveal the latter’shidden motivations, secrets, and players. This book is no different, save forthe fact that I have obviously added a new conceptual player: finance andeconomics. And along the way, we shall encounter other major conceptual scenerythat readers of my books have encountered before: alchemy, astrology, astronomy,torsion, Egypt, Babylon, Nazis, ancient texts and tomes and modern mathematicalgurus speaking the arcane language of statistical and topological lore.In fact, in one of those odd synchronicities that seem to increase in modernlife, as this book was being researched and written, decades — if not centuriesor even millennia — of corruption and intellectual flaccidity in the financial,banking, and corporate sectors of the world came to an ugly head with thecollapse of the housing and derivatives bubble, and the appearance of some ofthose responsible for the meltdown before the United States House ofRepresentatives, hands extended, asking for a bailout of their malfeasance andirresponsibility at the expense of the American taxpayer, and demanding nooversight to boot, as if they were being forced to pay some hidden blackmailer,and were afraid that oversight might disclose this fact.But why call it “irresponsibility” and not simply “criminality”? In the answerto that question there lies a tale, and it is a tale I did not originally intendto go into when I conceived the plan for this series of books many years ago,much less the plan for this one. Recent financial events, however, havecontrived to place the story I intended to tell after completing The NaziInternational and The Philosophers’ Stone into a rather different context. Aswill become apparent to the reader in the main text, I do believe there iscriminality and conspiracy involved in the story of the complex relationship ofphysics and finance throughout history. And paradoxically, the farther back onepursues this relationship, the closer together physics, finance, and all thoseother themes enunciated above as the conceptual scenery, draw together, and themore apparent the odor of a long-standing conspiracy becomes.But in and of itself the contemporary financial meltdown is both a story ofconspiracy as well as a case of galloping stupidity and colossal intellectual,political, and economic irresponsibility proportional to the aforesaidstupidity. It is nonetheless a story with its own deep connections to the storyof the main text, and it is as good an entry into the subject as any.So, as a way of entering into the discussion of the themes that preoccupy themain text, one may examine two salient modern examples that arose to challengethe reigning financial and physical assumptions of that money power.Those examples are Communist China and Nazi Germany."},{"pageContent":"B. MELTDOWN, OR MESSAGE"},{"pageContent":"1. David Li’s FormulaThis most contemporary chapter of this very long and ancient story began when aChinese mathematician, Dr. David X. Li, came up with a formula that seemed agodsend to Wall Street and City of London financial manipulators. The formula,known to most economists and mathematical analysts within major banking houses,is unfamiliar to most, but like Einstein’s E=Mc2 it is destined to become famousin history for the influence it had on human actions and politics. Here’s whatit looks like:Pr[TA<1, TB<1] = φ2(φ-1(FA(1)), φ-1(FB(1), γ).3 [4372.xhtml#3334]Li, who “grew up in rural China in the 1960s”4 [4372.xhtml#3336] eventuallyearned a master’s degree in economics at Nankai University and then left Chinato pursue an MBA from Laval University in Quebec, a master’s degree in actuarialscience and a Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Waterloo in Ontario,Canada.5 [4372.xhtml#3338] By 1997 Dr. Li had “landed at Canadian Imperial Bankof Commerce,” later moving to Barclays Capital in 2004.6 [4372.xhtml#3340]But what did the formula actually mean? What did it do?Felix Salmon summarizes the effect of the formula in a brilliant article, “AFormula for Disaster,” in the March 2009 issue of Wired magazine.(Li) took a notoriously tough nut — determining correlation, or how seeminglydisparate events are related — and cracked it wide open with a simple andelegant mathematical formula, one that would become ubiquitous in financeworldwide.For five years, Li’s formula, known as a Gaussian copula function, looked likean unambiguously positive breakthrough, a piece of financial technology thatallowed hugely complex risks to be modeled with more ease and accuracy than everbefore. With his brilliant spark of financial legerdemain, Li made it possiblefor traders to sell vast quantities of new securities, expanding financialmarkets to unimaginable levels.His method was adopted by everybody from bond investors and Wall Street banks toratings agencies and regulators. And it became so deeply entrenched — and wasmaking people so much money — that warnings about its limitations were largelyignored.Then the model fell apart. Cracks started appearing early on, when financialmarkets began behaving in ways that users of Li’s formula hadn’t expected. Thecracks became full-fledged canyons in 2008 — when ruptures in the financialsystem’s foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival ofthe global banking system in serious peril.….Li’s Gaussian copula formula will go down in history as instrumental incausing the unfathomable losses that brought the world financial system to itsknees.7 [4372.xhtml#3342]But again, what precisely did the formula do? And how did it do it? How did itcause the financial meltdown?The key lies precisely in that important word, “correlation.” Li’s formulaseemed to make sense of the “thousands of moving parts”8 [4372.xhtml#3344] of aninterlocked economic system. Salmon illustrates what Li’s formula did via asimple analogy:To understand the mathematics of correlation better, consider something simple,like a kid in an elementary school. Let’s call her Alice. The probability thather parents will get divorced this year is about 5 percent, the risk of hergetting head lice is about 5 percent, the chance of her seeing a teacher slip ona banana peel is about 5 percent, and the likelihood of her winning the classspelling bee is about 5 percent. If investors were trading securities based onthe chances of those things happening only to Alice, they would all trade atmore or less the same price.But something important happens when we start looking at two kids rather thanone — not just Alice but also the girl she sits next to, Britney. If Britney’sparents get divorced, what are the chances that Alice’s parents will getdivorced, too? Still about 5 percent: The correlation there is close to zero.But if Britney gets head lice, the chance that Alice will get head lice is muchhigher, about 50 percent — which means the correlation is probably up in the 0.5range. If Britney sees a teacher slip on a banana peel, what is the chance Alicewill see it, too? Very high indeed, since they sit next to each other: It couldbe as much as 95 percent, which means the correlation is close to 1. And ifBritney wins the class spelling bee, the chance of Alice winning it is zero,which means the correlation is negative: -1.If investors were trading securities based on the chances of these thingshappening to both Alice and Britney, the prices would be all over the place,because the correlations vary so much.9 [4372.xhtml#3346]Now factor in thousands, even millions, of individuals, and thousands ofinterlocking correlated conditions — energy prices, building and housing costs,money and credit supply and so on — and one gets the idea of the complexity ofthe system of correlations, and the beguiling simplicity of Dr. Li’s formula.The reason its simplicity was so beguiling is in itself rather simple. As Salmonputs it in his article:…(It’s) a very inexact science. Just measuring those initial 5 percentprobabilities involves collecting lots of disparate data points and subjectingthem to all manner of statistical and error analysis. Trying to assess theconditional probabilities — the chance that Alice will get head lice if Britneygets head lice — is an order of magnitude harder, since those data points aremuch rarer. As a result of the scarcity of historical data, the errors there arelikely to be much greater.10 [4372.xhtml#3348]Bear that point about the need for historical data in mind, for it not onlyplays a significant role immediately below in the methodological assumptions ofDr. Li and his formula, but will play an even more important role in chaptertwo.It is regarding this point of historical data, or rather, the assumed lackthereof, that Dr. Li’s formula provided a way out of the impasse, or so itseemed at the time:Using some relatively simple math — by Wall Street standards, anyway — Li cameup with an ingenious way to model default correlation without even looking atthe historical default data. Instead, he used market data about the prices ofinstruments known as credit default swaps.11 [4372.xhtml#3350]In other words, within Li’s elegant statistical copula formula lies a hiddenmethodological assumption, namely, that historical data on credit default ratescould be safely jettisoned in favor of an immediate concentration on the“current” market prices of “credit default swaps.” As we shall see in chaptertwo, there was a great deal of historical data available, and that data in turnpointed to a “deep physics” of financial cycles that few economists — or evenphysicists for that matter — could scarcely guess at and even fewer knew existedat all.But we are getting ahead of ourselves. What exactly are “credit default swaps”?This is where the story of Li’s formula gets very interesting, and Salmonexplains what they are with clear concision:If you’re an investor, you have a choice these days: You can either lenddirectly to borrowers or sell investors credit default swaps, insurance againstthose same borrowers defaulting. Either way, you get a regular income stream —interest payments or insurance payments — and either way, if the borrowerdefaults, you lose a lot of money. The returns on both strategies are nearlyidentical, but because an unlimited number of credit default swaps can be soldagainst each borrower, the supply of swaps isn’t constrained the way the supplyof bonds is, so the CDS market managed to grow extremely rapidly. Though creditdefault swaps were relatively new when Li’s paper came out, they soon became abigger and more liquid market than the bonds on which they were based.12[4372.xhtml#3352]Enter Dr. Li, for his formula was nothing more than “a model that used pricerather than real-world default data as a shortcut (making an implicit assumptionthat financial markets in general, and CDS markets in particular, can pricedefault risk correctly).”13 [4372.xhtml#3354] Salmon explains Li’s technique bymincing no words:It was a brilliant simplification of an intractable problem. And Li didn’t justradically dumb down the difficulty of working out correlations; he decided notto even bother trying to map and calculate all the nearly infinite relationshipsbetween the various loans that made up a pool. What happens when the number ofpool members increases or when you mix negative correlations with positive ones?Never mind all that, he said. The only thing that matters is the finalcorrelation number — one clean, simple, all-sufficient figure that sums upeverything.14 [4372.xhtml#3356]Li had reduced the problem to a simple dimensionless number — a scalar inmathematicians’ terms — that in its simplicity cast a beguiling spell over theworld’s financial and securities market.Indeed, the formula’s effect was almost immediate and “electric” because WallStreet’s financial gurus, “armed with Li’s formula” deduced from it a…new world of possibilities. And the first thing they did was start creatingbrand-new triple-A securities. Using Li’s copula approach meant that ratingsagencies like Moody’s — or anybody wanting to model the risk of a (bundle ofsecurities) — no longer needed to puzzle over the underlying securities. Allthey needed was the correlation number, and out would come a rating telling themhow safe or risky the (bundle) was.As a result, just about anything could be bundled and turned into a triple-Abond — corporate bonds, bank loans, mortgage-backed securities, whatever youliked. The consequent pools were often known as collateralized debt obligations,or CDOs. You could (bundle) that pool and create a triple-A security even ifnone of the components were themselves triple-A. You could even take lower-rated(bundles) of other CDOs, put them in a pool, and (bundle) them — an instrumentknown as a CDO-squared, which at that point was so far removed from any actualunderlying bond or loan or mortgage that no one really had a clue what itincluded. But it didn’t matter. All you needed was Li’s copula function.15[4372.xhtml#3358]In other words, the effect of Dr. Li’s formula was to abandon the focus on therelative strength and risk of each component, since they were now interlockedvia the copula itself, and this in turn led to an explosion of more and more“bundles” of securities and credit swaps, and even to bundles of bundles.As a result of this increasing interlock and correlation,The CDS and CDO markets grew together, feeding on each other. At the end of2001, there was $920 billion in credit default swaps outstanding. By the end of2007, that number had skyrocketed to more than $62 trillion. The CDO market,which stood at $275 billion in 2000, grew to $4.7 trillion by 2006. At the heartof it all was Li’s formula.16 [4372.xhtml#3360]To put it succinctly, Li’s formula was a way of adding yet another multilayeredability to create credit and interest — an alchemical operation — out ofliterally nothing.There was also another hidden danger in Li’s formula, and that was that even forthose financial institutions that did take into consideration historical data,there was not much historical data to go on for the simple reason that “creditdefault swaps had been in existence less than a decade,” a decade during which“house prices soared.”17 [4372.xhtml#3362] Indeed, Li’s formula had the effect,as already has been seen, of inflating such “bundling” exponentially andcontributing to the creation of bundles of bundles with literally millions ofpotential correlated factors, none of which, it bears repeating, were based onhistorical data of anything more than a few years’ duration. And this revealsanother flaw in the formula and its application to securities correlations andtheir ratings, for implicit in the technique was a hidden assumption that“correlation was more of a constant than a variable,”18 [4372.xhtml#3364] thatis, while the individual components of such bundles were variable, theircorrelation was not.Consequently, by abandoning historical data, and by relying upon this hiddenassumption of correlation constancy, the model could not cope with any suddendownturn in prices, such as occurred in the housing market and mortgage sectors.In short, the whole technique had abandoned the well- and commonly-known factthat economic activity, for whatever reason, seems to occur in repeated cyclesof growth and decline, or if one prefer, of “boom” and “bust.” And in thisknowledge of cycles, as will be seen, there also lies quite a tale, and acarefully hidden one at that.Suspiciously, Dr. Li, after publishing his formula, returned to China in 2008and has been curiously silent during the debate over the causes and culpritsbehind the crash. But in the ultimate twist to the story, he has returned toBeijing where he is in charge of “the risk-management department of ChinaInternational Capital Corporation”!19 [4372.xhtml#3366] This raises disturbingpossibilities, not the least of which was that the whole episode mightconceivably have been a form of economic warfare, but by whom, and against whom?Whatever the answer to that question may be — and it is not as apparent as itmight seem — it is clear that Dr. Li’s formula would provide the necessarymathematical technique and “technology” to anyone inclined to wage such economicwarfare, particularly if such persons or groups were in the possession ofhistorical or other data that indicated an inevitable economic downturn werecoming, and who, seeking to worsen it for their own purposes, used Li’s formulato create the correlatives or derivatives bubble of bundles and credit swaps, abubble that would pop when the inevitable fall in prices occurred. As will beseen in chapter two, there is precisely such data available, and it did indicatean inevitable cyclic economic downturn would begin ca. 2000-2006."},{"pageContent":"2. The Li Clan, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and the TriadsBut that is not all there is to the David Li story. This part of the story,however, appears to have been carefully hidden from the public, for reasons thatwill become apparent in a moment. As noted above, among Dr. Li’s many careermoves and positions, he began to work for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in1997, moving from there to Barclay’s in 2004. Thus, when his paper with thenotorious formula — “On Default Correlation: A Copula Approach” — was publishedin 2000, Li still worked for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.This reveals some interesting possible connections.As most people know, Chinese names actually begin with the surname, followed bythe individual’s proper name. Thus my name, following the Chinese custom, wouldbe Farrell Joseph rather than Joseph Farrell. More importantly, the name Li is afairly common surname in China, like the name Smith or Brown would be in theU.S.A., Britain, or Canada. People with a common surname do not therefore implyany blood relation, and people with the same surname are often strangers to eachother.The same holds true for China, but with one significant exception. In Chineseculture, people with the same surname — regardless of whether there are bloodties or not — are regarded by the Chinese as coming from the same family, orclan. Thus, two Chinese strangers with the same surname will more often than notregard each other differently than two strangers with different surnames. Theywill, to a certain extent, regard each other as part of a very large family,extending to each other the customs and courtesies common between familymembers.And this places Dr. David X. Li into a very different potential interpretivecontext, for at the same time as he was employed by the Canadian Imperial Bankof Commerce and authoring his now notorious paper, a fellow clansman, one LiKai-Shing, owned a significant bloc of that bank’s stock.But who is Li Kai-Shing? He is one of Hong Kong’s most famous billionaires, who,along with his sons Victor and Richard, assumed significant governmental poststo aid in the transition of Hong Kong from a British Crown Colony back toChinese jurisdiction. Li Kai-Shing’s financial empire stretches through Asia’smedia and financial markets, and even more significantly, another Li, Li Chiang,was at one time head of Red China’s China International Trust and InvestmentCorporation, in charge basically of China’s foreign trade with the West, andparticularly with the United States and Canada.20 [4372.xhtml#3368] After Dr.David Li left the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in 2004, Li Kai-Shing soldhis stake in the bank the very next year.21 [4372.xhtml#3370]Not even this, however, begins to plumb the depths of the importance of the Liclan in China, for the clan has had several emperors, including Emperor LiZhuanxu, who reigned before 2000 B.C. Additionally, a Li founded the TangDynasty (618-906 A.D.). Most significantly, the Li clan appears to have beeninvolved with financial wheeling and dealing from an early time, being the sameclan that introduced paper money to China during the same Tang dynasty.22[4372.xhtml#3372]We now have the following intriguing latticework of relationships:1. An old and influential Chinese clan, very much involved in government andfinance, from early Chinese history;2. The same clan involved in the same activities millennia later; and3. One member of the clan develops the formula that led to the current meltdown.And far from being dismissed as a competent risk assessor by the Chinese, hereturns to China to a post doing precisely what his formula was designed to do:assess risk!All this, of course, places David X. Li’s return to Red China and assumption ofa position in a Chinese corporation concerned with overseas trade, and onceagain in a position where he is “assessing risk,” into a very interestingcontext, making it unlikely that his and namesake Li Kai-Shing’s departure fromthe Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce were coincidental.But not even this tells the whole tale of the Li clan!The Li clan “is one of the principal families which has controlled” thenotorious Chinese criminal secret society, the Triads.23 [4372.xhtml#3374]According to researcher Fritz Springmeier, the following Lis have been leadersof various sections of the Triads:Li Chi-t’ang -overseas leader Li Hsien-chihLi Hsiu-ch’eng -Hunan Li Hung -Honan Li K’ai-ch’en -Triad, Shanghai Li Lap Ting-Kwangsi province Li Ping-ch’ing -Triad, Shanghai Li Shih-chinLi Wen-mao -north of Peking, Fatshan Li Yuan-fa -Hunan Li Choi-fat -Hong Kong LiJahfar-Mah -Britain24 [4372.xhtml#3376]And just what are the Triads? They are a Chinese criminal secret society, deeplyconnected with the opium trade, the practice of Chinese occult activities, andthey are, in Springmeier’s apt description, “something of a cross between theMasons and the Mafia — something in the line of P2 Freemasonry — except muchbigger.”25 [4372.xhtml#3378] Indeed, some estimates put the membership of theTriads and similar Oriental secret societies as close to two million, if notmore. Thus, the possibility that the entire current meltdown was the a covertact of economic warfare looms rather large, especially given the fact that theCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is also known to have some strong ties to theRothschild banking interest.In short, we have clear indications of the possibility that China has signaledthat it is not simply going to be a subservient player in whatever “New WorldOrder” schemes the Anglo-American elite wishes to implement and impose on therest of the world.In this respect, it is important to observe the pattern that the Li clantypifies:1. The clan is ancient, with strong ties going back millennia, both togovernment and finance;2. The clan is moreover connected with a secret society, whose activities inturn are connected with:a. Occult religious activity;b. Criminal business organization and activity;c. Assassinations, blackmail, and infiltration of government and finance;3. The clan is clearly connected to a mathematical model of economic and creditactivity, implying a hidden interest in developing such formally explicitmodels; and finally,4. That model is the culprit responsible for the current economic meltdown,which has affected primarily the institutions of the Anglo-American financialelite.As will be seen, such activities and patterns or relationships are not unique tothe present or previous century. They are, in fact (as the Li clan itselfevidences) millennia old and firmly rooted within the history of humancivilizations and their banking class. However, the consistency of this behaviorand this constellation of relationships is rooted in “something more” — andcertainly nothing less — than “human nature,” or “greed,” or even “thepredictable actions of a particular socio-economic class.”That something else lies in a little-noticed connection between physics andfinance that is as old as man’s fascination with the stars, and with what goodor ill fortunes they might portend. And that is also to say that there has been,since ancient times, a profound connection between physics and economics, and astruggle between those who view both as closed systems, and those who view bothas open systems. We shall call those who adhere to the closed system of physicsand finance by the term “banksters,” to indicate the chimerical and criminalhybrids of gangster and banker. These people are indeed driven by an almostboundless lust for power, by a criminal greed and wanton disregard of thehumanity they wish to enslave. But they are also driven by a knowledge ofcertain hidden things, among them the profound relationship between physics andfinance."},{"pageContent":"3. China’s MoneyThere is a little-known aspect to China’s booming economy that Westernfinanciers, economists, and media mandarins are loath to discuss, and that isthat China’s money is created by China, and not borrowed from private bankers.In effect, this means China’s money is debt-free. In short, Communist China hasfollowed the precedent established by the American federal constitution, wherethe money-creating and issuing power lies with the Congress, that is, with thestate. As Ellen Hodgson Brown observed in her magisterial book on the wholeproblem of central private banking monopolies on money issuance, Web of Debt,the key difference in China’s system and that prevailing in most other nationsIs its banking system. China has a government-issued currency and a system ofnational banks that are actually owned by the nation. According to Wikipedia,the People’s Bank of China is “unusual in acting as a national bank, focusing onthe country not on the currency.” The notion of “national banking,” as opposedto private “central banking,” goes back to Lincoln, Carey, and the Americannationalists. Henry C.K. Liu distinguishes the two systems like this: a nationalbank serves the interests of the nation and its people. A central bank servesthe interests of private international finance.26 [4372.xhtml#3380]Even though China’s currency, the yuan, is pegged to the dollar in terms of itsexchange rate value, China’s banking system is testament to the fact that itsgovernment has seen what American politicians and a great deal of its peopleformerly understood, namely that when a private bank creates money, it onlycreates the principal, not the interest. When a state, on the other hand,creates money, it has the ability to expand the money supply according to thecredit needs of the nation.In short, when a nation’s money represents a principal on which interest isowed, someone always comes out the loser, since there is never enough money incirculation to repay the debt interest, and thus, a national debt can never berepaid, it can only grow. Contrariwise, when a nation’s money represents areceipt for goods and services rendered and is issued interest-free by the stateitself, that state can experience almost total employment, and there is nobuilt-in principal of debt and scarcity.It is these two systems, where money is created by a private monopoly in limitedsupply, which represents an interest-bearing debt note, or where money iscreated by the state as a receipt for goods and services and is debt-free, thatare the two systems which have contended against each other throughout history.In the former system, the system of money in circulation is closed, and there isnever as much money in circulation as there is debt, and hence, scarcity becomesthe order of the day, as limited supplies of money compete for limited goods,resources, and energy. In the latter system, the system of money is open and canexpand, as the economy whose goods and services it represents as receiptsexpands with it. In terms of the analogy to physics, the former system can neverfunction at over-unity, whereas in the latter system, it must function as such."},{"pageContent":"C. NAZI GERMANY: PHYSICS AND FINANCE FULLY RATIONALIZEDThis relationship between finance and physics was, in modern times, firstclearly perceived by that nation which not only established state-createddebt-free money, but which also sponsored a variety of secret research projectsinto “free-energy” physics and technologies: Nazi Germany.When World War I ended and the Allies imposed war reparations on defeatedGermany, the total reparations to be paid exceeded the value of all the propertyin Germany by three times!27 [4372.xhtml#3382] Anyone who has studied thehistory knows the story: Germany hyper-inflated its currency, paying off theAllies with increasingly worthless Reichsmarks and destroying Germany’s economyin the process. But, it is to be noted, these Reichsmarks were still theissuances of a privately controlled bank, and thus, Germany’s debt situationonly compounded dramatically.Hitler’s Reichsbank President, Dr. Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, let the bigsecret out in his 1967 book The Magic of Money:The mark’s dramatic devaluation began soon after the Reichsbank was“privatized,” or delivered to private investors. What drove the wartimeinflation into hyperinflation, said Schacht, was speculation by foreigninvestors, who would sell the mark short, betting on its decreasing value….Speculation in the German mark was made possible because the Reichsbank mademassive amounts of currency available for borrowing, marks that were created ondemand and lent at a profitable interest to the bank. When the Reichsbank couldnot keep up with the voracious demand for marks, other private investment bankswere allowed to create them out of nothing and lend them at interest as well.28[4372.xhtml#3384]Thus, the German government was not responsible for the postwar hyperinflation.It was Germany’s privately owned central bank and its monopoly on the country’smoney creation — money created as a circulating note of debt — that created theproblem! Germany’s economy was crashed and devastated by the bankers.Until Hitler.While most people are aware that various private financial powers in the Westwere instrumental in placing Hitler and the National Socialist Party into powerin Germany,29 [4372.xhtml#3386] what most do not realize is how quickly Hitlerturned on his backers and refused to play ball by the same oldRockefeller-Rothschild rules:…(A)utocratic authority did give Adolf Hitler something the AmericanGreenbackers could only dream about — total control of the economy. He was ableto test their theories, and he proved that they worked. Like for Lincoln,Hitler’s choices were to either submit to total debt slavery or create his ownfiat money; and like Lincoln, he chose the fiat solution. He implemented a planof public works along the lines proposed by Jacob Coxey and the Greenbackers inthe 1890s. Projects earmarked for funding included flood control, repair ofpublic buildings and private residences, and construction of new buildings,roads, bridges, canals, and port facilities. The projected cost of the variousprograms was fixed at one billion units of the national currency. One billionnon-inflationary bills of exchange called Labor Treasury Certificates were thenissued against this cost. Millions of people were put to work on these projects,and the workers were paid with the Treasury Certificates. The workers then spentthe certificates on goods and services, creating more jobs for more people. Thecertificates were also referred to as MEFO bills, or sometimes as “Feder money.”…(T)hey avoided the need to borrow from international lenders or to pay offinternational debt.The result of these Nazi machinations against the international money power waspredictable: foreign credit was refused, and hence, Germany faced an almostcomplete inability to conduct foreign trade and commerce. But again, the Naziregime did an end run around the banksters, restoring foreign trade by cuttingout the banking middleman and resorting to a system of barter with othernations.30 [4372.xhtml#3388]And where did Hitler get these “radical” financial ideas?When he first attended a meeting of the early National Socialist Party, helearned of the views of a German economist named Gottfried Feder.The basis of Feder’s ideas was that the state should create and control itsmoney supply through a nationalized central bank rather than have it created byprivately owned banks, to whom interest would have to be paid. From this viewderived the conclusion that finance had enslaved the population by usurping thenation’s control of money.31 [4372.xhtml#3390]Feder and other German theorists had for their part based their theories on astudy of the American constitution, and more importantly, that President AbrahamLincoln had financed the Northern effort in the American Civil War by creatingdebt-free “greenbacks,” bypassing New York banks and interest debt completely.32[4372.xhtml#3392]But Nazi Germany did something else, something quite significant. Realizing thatGermany was at the mercy of the very banksters that controlled the world’s oilsupplies and hence the energy needed to maintain Germany’s national sovereignty,The Third Reich established entire departments of the SS called the Forschung,Entwicklung, und Patente, and the SS Entwicklungstelle 4, or “Research,Development, and Patents,” and “SS Development Area Four,” respectively. The topsecret mission brief of these departments were to scour and pull patents havingnational security implications, and to investigate and develop the technologiesof “free energy,” i.e., the technologies that would allow Germany to engineerthe physical medium and its energy directly, and to tap into it for its energyneeds, and as a weapon.33 [4372.xhtml#3394] Add to this the fact that, withinthe intellectual cauldron that was the SS, ideas from advanced thoughlittle-known physics conceptions circulated and percolated along with the ideathat there was a physics hidden in ancient tomes and epics,34 [4372.xhtml#3396]and one now obtains a very revealing set of relationships:1. A nation that has restored its sovereign right to issue its own debt-freecurrency, breaking from the orbit of the international money power;2. A nation that has also clearly seen that in order to break completely fromthe dominance of that power, it must have access to a completely differentsource of energy that is nearly inexhaustible and not monopolized by thatprivate money power;3. Thus, that nation must seek to develop and control the technologies of themanipulation of that energy for itself; and finally,4. That nation has perceived an ancient link or connection between the physicsit seeks to develop, and the financial policy it seeks to develop.One may discern from this list quite obviously that Nazi Germany was not onlyable to achieve nearly full employment mere years after the regime took power,but that it was very deliberately gearing up for an inevitable war. But thislist discloses a possible hidden reason for those war preparations beyond thoseof the Nazi lust of “living space” and world conquest; Germany’s decision toissue state-created money “would mean that the international financiers would beunable to exercise…control through the international gold standard…and this mayhave led to controlling Germany through warfare instead.”35 [4372.xhtml#3398]This hidden reason for the war — that the Allies essentially acted as “agents”for the international money power against a great power that had essentiallysevered all connections to it — may also provide a similar rationalization forthe Allied demands for German unconditional surrender, essentially ensuring thatthe war would continue until Germany was basically destroyed and physicallyoccupied.The relationship between banking and the quest to acquire, or suppress, exoticphysics technology may be glimpsed by yet another detour, this time to apersistent struggle."},{"pageContent":"D. ENERGY AND MONEY-CREATING AUTARCHYIf one takes these two very disparate instances as a clue, and especially thatof Nazi Germany, then this suggests that there has been a persistent strugglethroughout history between those who wish to democratize the production ofenergy, based on “alternative energy technologies,” and who, similarly, wish torestore to the state its money-creating power and wrest it from private hands,and those who wish to monopolize that hidden technology and physics, andsimilarly, to hold a private monopoly over the money-creation of various states.Consider what these very unique and different examples disclose:1. In the case of Communist China, we have an instance of a modern andtechnologically sophisticated world power issuing state-created debt-free money,a fact that has led to its economic boom and its “independence” from theinternational money power;2. In the case of Nazi Germany, we have not only a nation that saw the advantageof such state-issued debt-free currency, but also of a state that clearly sawthe connection between that sovereign money power and the analogous physics ofreceiving its energy directly from the physical medium, an energy source notbased on non-renewable energy “resources.” Furthermore, it is clearly implied bythe Nazi SS’ interest in ancient and esoteric texts that there may be an ancientconnection between this type of finance and this type of physics;As will be seen, the struggle between these two camps has erupted throughouthistory in violence, as the latter group that advocates open systems seeks tooverturn the dominant order of the moneychangers — the banksters — based onclosed systems, or, conversely, as the banksters seek to extend their power viaclosed systems of physics and economics must respond to the inevitable threatposed by civilizations or countries adopting the open ones. Most recently thatstruggle erupted in the enormous conflict we call World War II, as Nazi Germany,for whatever its genocidal and murderous crimes against humanity, at leastperceived part of the struggle correctly: it was a war to free Germany from aheinous international money power — misrepresented of course in Nazi ideology bythe Jews — based in Great Britain and the British Empire, and in the UnitedStates of America.Thus, Nazi Germany’s pursuit of “free energy” and “energy independence” or“autarchy,” as well as her pursuit of a radical alternative hyper-dimensionalphysics, was a part of that struggle.36 [4372.xhtml#3400] By the same token, notfor nothing did Nazi Germany essentially restore the idea of public, debt-free,state-created money and credit, while simultaneously pursuing these super-secretadvanced physics projects. The two were conceptually united, and, as we shallalso discover within these pages, had been so for a long time. The Nazis weresimply the ones who in modern times first drew the connection between physicsand finance, and determined to do something about it. As far as Nazi Germany wasconcerned, then, there was a grisly and gruesome logic to the Holocaust, forhaving identified “World Jewry” as the center of this International Money Power,the use of enslaved Jews in the concentration camps to create this new physicsand its associated technologies, and a new economy on which they hopedeventually to place the Reich, was in their warped view a kind of “justice”meted out to those who had so ravaged and pillaged Germany in the wake of theVersailles Treaty and the Dawes and Young Plans. There was, of course, ahalf-truth to this, for there was indeed a prominent element of Jewish, orrather, Zionist influence in such financial circles. One need only recall thenames of Rothschild, Warburg, Schiff and so on in this regard. But there alltruth stops and the lies begin, for there was also a prominent element ofProtestant monied groups involved as well. Thus, for consistency’s sake, theNazis should equally have been concerned with the Protestant aristocracy ofEngland, America, Canada, and even their own country as well.World War II ended, of course, with the defeat of Nazi Germany, but notnecessarily with the defeat of Nazism and its goals in alternative physics andfinance.37 [4372.xhtml#3402] However, as we shall see, the postwar period beganwith an unusual event, an event I believe many to have profoundlymisinterpreted. Rather than seeing that a kind of détente or modus vivendi wasstruck between elements of what I call the “Nazi International” on the one handand the globalist Anglo-American corporate and banking elite on the other, mostprefer to view certain events as testament to the fact that one more or lesscoherent and monolithic “international conspiracy of money” exists, and that itis entering the “end game phase” of its goal of total world domination. Thecloser to that goal that this group actually approaches, the more sharp andacute will factional infighting within it become, particularly as such bankstersare in thrall to the closed system paradigm of physics and finance. In short,that postwar détente is showing distinctive signs of breaking down, as eachfaction maneuvers to emerge as the dominant faction when the eventual goal isreached. For that globalist elite, this problem is further compounded by theemergence of the economic powers of Eurasia — Russia, China, and Japan — who arealso showing increasing signs of reluctance to play by the tired old rules ofthe Anglo-American empire. Witness once again Dr. Li’s mysterious“disappearance” from the West and reemergence as a risk manager for a prominentcorporation in Communist China!However, between those periods when this conflict of worldviews of physics andfinance breaks out into open violence and warfare, the struggle is more covertand hidden, as suggested, again, by the David Li episode. In the case of suchcovert warfare, the various factions of international banksters resort to everyocculted means at their disposal to suppress open development of alternativephysics — and therefore of the alternative economies and financial institutionssuch physics would inevitably usher in — while they seek to maintain the statusquo and become the dominant faction within it. The methods, chiefly, arethreefold: they must first suppress technologies that testify to the existenceof another physics than the “public consumption physics” they have so carefullyinculcated for the masses and promoted in academies and textbooks. Secondly,they must suppress the alternative physics itself, for in some respects it isthe real source of their power, as we shall also eventually see. Thirdly, andfinally, they must obfuscate the profound, deep, and ancient connections betweenthis alternative physics and alternative institutions of finance and economy.To sum it up, they must seek to suppress its open development, whilesimultaneously pursue its covert development so that they can, in turn,monopolize it and further consolidate power into their own hands. By the sametoken, this means that any given faction within what is called “The New WorldOrder” must likewise inhibit or arrest the development of such alternativetheories and technologies by rival factions, or alternatively, develop superiorversions of it, or defenses against it, themselves. Conversely, those groups orindividuals advocating open systems of physics and economics not only must runthe gauntlet of all who oppose them, but develop their theories and technologiesand bring them to as wide a public as quickly as possible. In short, the “goodguys” seek to democratize the whole science.Consequently, we are conspicuously in the presence of a very complex dynamic,one stretching from the individual person to whole civilizations and all theinstitutions thereof, and one moreover crossing several disciplines — physics,economics and finance, theology, history — and running like a gold and crimsonthread throughout the millennia of human history. We must consider salientmodern events where this struggle has openly erupted, and compare them toancient manifestations of a similar nature. We must ponder the presence withinancient megaliths and temples of a profound astronomical and astrologicalscience, their physics implications, and ponder further why so many of theseancient sites are also associated with the presence of moneychangers, ofbanksters. We must similarly ponder again what all this might mean for theoccurrence of an ancient and interplanetary war within our own celestialneighborhood.38 [4372.xhtml#3404] Yet again, we must consider what all this hasto do with the stubborn persistence of alchemy from ancient to modern times, andwhat it may have to do with the consistent royal and imperial patronage of itthroughout the Middle Ages and early Renaissance. We must look for the clues ofdeliberate suppression of this physics — and its implied economics — throughoutthe ages, and especially in our own. And finally, we shall have reason toconsider why bloodlines seem to be such an important part of the story for thosebankster and royal elites.Given all these complex dynamics and disparate facts, I was confronted withsomething of a problem in writing this book. Normally I aim for a relativelyhigh degree of “completeness” or at least thoroughness when writing a book. ButI quickly discovered that, if I were to explore every facet of this complexdynamic with anything approaching thoroughness, I would not be writing a merebook, but several books, with each aspect of the problem requiring volumes ofits own. For example, the involvement of major corporations in suppression ofinventions and technologies implying a new physics and new energy source is astory that would and could consume volumes, as there is no shortage of suchstories on the internet and books about the subject. Similarly, the machinationsof the international banksters has provided a rich field for research andspeculation, and spawned literally hundreds of books on the subject, both thoseby “sanctioned insiders” and those examining the subject from without. When oneadds economics and physics and systems of money creation to this picture, thebibliography of such a work itself would end up being a whole book.So clearly some other approach was needed. What I have attempted to do,therefore, is outline a case and my interpretation of the evidence backing it upwith examples. This book is thus deliberately intended to be read not only inconjunction with my own previous books on alternative science and history as yetanother chapter in a very big story, but also in tandem with the overall outputof other researchers into the field. Thus, it simply assumes the existence ofthat research, and the reader’s broad familiarity with it.But let there be no mistake: this is not an easy, lighthearted book simplybecause it is not a complete or thorough one. The number and types of details,conceptions, and disciplines to be examined are considerable, and theirinterrelationships are even more so. With that said, the reader is cautionedabout two things: first, in order to survey these connections and theirimplications, much of this book is “introduction”; only at the very end and inthe final chapter will it be possible to tie all the threads together and drawtheir implications. Thus, patience is required as the data is laid out, andconnections are drawn. Secondly, what is presented here is likewise aspeculative though nevertheless argued case. Were each and every point to bedocumented at length, as already mentioned, each would require a tome in its ownright.This is a survey, not an encyclopedia; a study, not a painting; an essay, not amathematical or historical proof.Nonetheless, I hope that by consulting certain sources, mentioning certaintopics, construing the interrelationships, and drawing the conclusions andimplications in the manner that I have, that I will point the reader in thedirection to examine these questions more fully on his own, for the problem isnot in the dearth of information, interpretations, and implications, but intheir surfeit. The interpretation proffered here is consequently not the onlypossible one. I maintain only that, of all the possible interpretations of thisvast complex of information — alchemy, astrology, astronomy, torsion, Egypt,Babylon, Nazis, finance, geometries, earth grids and “scalar” physics, ancienttexts and tomes and modern mathematical gurus speaking the arcane language ofstatistical economics and topological lore — that this interpretation is atleast a plausible one.All that being said, if along the way I have in some small measure contributedto the demise of these goofy, insane, and ruthless banksters and theirmurderously utopian and loony New World Order schemes, then so much the better,for one thing, I hope, is now evident: if in the private creation of money as aninterest-bearing debt-note, only the principal, and not the interest, is createdby those banks and circulated as “money,” then it inevitably follows that, undersuch a system, debt can only grow and never be repaid. With that fact, theinfluence and control of that private class of banksters over the policies of astate can only grow, and to the increasing detriment of that nation’s people andits public good.As such, any discussion of financial policy by any politician of any politicalparty affiliation in any nation that does not begin with a call to restore thepower of money creation and issuance to the government in such a capacity thatit is made to serve the public good and not the private rapacity of a banksterclass, is merely deception, and deception for a very simple reason. The bigsecret of money is not only that it must represent something, but rather that itmust represent someone. As such, there are really only two basic models of moneyknown to history, the first model, where money represents a debtinterest-bearing note — the “something” — created by a private monopoly — the“someone” — for its own class interest and profit; and the second model, wheremoney represents a receipt for goods and services — the “something” — producedby a state’s people — the “someone” — who through the agency of their stateissue that money to themselves, debt-free.The problem of money is thus not even the what nor the how much, but the who,i.e., the who behind its issuance. The first model is a kind of “false alchemy”or a technology of black magic, for it is ultimately a technology to gain themastery over the will, genius, and productive activity of a people, andultimately, over the physical medium itself. And it is all based, as we shallnow see, on a breathtaking series of historical, conceptual, and physicaldeceptions, and these can only exist so long as there are those unwilling tounmask the deception, or so long as there as those who acquiesce to that systemand are unwilling to free themselves from its chains."},{"pageContent":"I.HISTORICAL AND CONCEPTUAL BACKGROUND“We shall have world government whether or not you like it — by conquest orconsent.”— James Warburg, son of Paul Warburg, February 17, 1950,Testimony to the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee“Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of a day, buta series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished period, and pursuedunalterably through every change of ministers, too plainly prove a deliberatesystematical plan of reducing us to slavery.”— Thomas Jefferson“But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the sameObject evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is theirright, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guardsfor their future security.”— Declaration of Independence of the United States of America"},{"pageContent":"OneTHE CONSPIRATORS’ POSTWAR DETENTE[5698.jpeg]“Since it is quite impossible to understand the history of the twentieth centurywithout some understanding of the role played by money in domestic affairs andin foreign affairs, as well as the role played by bankers in economic life andin political life, we must take a glance at each of these four subjects.”— Dr. Carroll Quigley39 [4372.xhtml#3406]If, as the epigraph cited above suggests, it is “quite impossible” to come to anaccurate assessment of the domestic and foreign policies of any state in moderntimes without an understanding of the role of money, then one would be equallyjustified in saying that it is quite impossible to understand ancient history —or any period of history — without understanding the role of money and itsmanipulation in social organization, policy, or science.However, money, at least in modern times, is the result of an “alchemical”operation and a kind of “financial technology,” the operation of transmutingnothing into something, in this case, of turning a mere entry on a bank ledger —a “nothing” — into a unit of commercial exchange — a “something.” Likewise,alchemy is a “science” of transmuting base metals into gold, and that implies anunderlying physics and technology to accomplish the act. To call both analchemical operation is to imply the fact that beneath the magical operations ofbanking there lies a deep physics, and perhaps a profoundly misunderstoodphysics. In any case, these are the conceptual poles between which our storymoves.But there are two historical poles between which our story also moves."},{"pageContent":"A. A HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOImagine for a moment that there is a Very High and extremely ancientCivilization. It has reached the apex of its social and scientific achievement.Then, in a paroxysm of madness and greed, it tears itself apart in a Great War.As the untold destruction reaches its climax and the great sophistication of itsscience and technology — the very science and technology it has used to wage itswar — can no longer be sustained due to the enormous damage to itsinfrastructure, both sides see that all is lost, and they each conspire tosalvage as much as they can of their science and technology by contriving anintricate symbolic language that can be decoded when civilization reaches asimilar stage of scientific and social development. The strategy is one oflong-term survival and eventual recovery, and each side fully realizes that theactual meaning of the symbols will most likely be lost in the short term.Nonetheless, they each conspire to create secret fraternities to maintain thesymbols, pass them down, and to the extent possible, begin the work of theirdecoding and of the restoration of the very science and technology that led totheir demise.It is natural and reasonable to assume that, parallel to this activity, eachside will take inventory of its remaining scientific and technological assets,and to secret them away for their potential rediscovery and reuse. Similarly, itis reasonable to assume that the “victors” of said war will take inventory ofthe “loser’s” assets and technologies, and confiscate some, destroy what cannotbe moved or otherwise used, and forbid to the vanquished any further developmentor deployment of such technologies.If all this sounds vaguely familiar, like the activities of the victoriousAllies or of vanquished Germans after World Wars I and II, then the reader willbe correct.But we assume a much more destructive war in our imaginary scenario. We assumethe existence of a scientific and technological sophistication that would makeall our modern instrumentalities of destruction seem but mere popguns.Similarly, we assume an extent of that mythical civilization that is trulycosmic in character, and a war of truly cosmic and interplanetary scope, ofwhich all civilizations and wars that follow are but mere shadows on the longclimb back to a similar peak of development. Similarly, the strategy ofinventory-taking, of the secreting away of now lost technologies and sciences,and of the making of a complex of symbols and the founding of secretfraternities to preserve them, is far grander in scope than the activities ofvictorious Allies or vanquished Germans in recent memory. But note, it is thescope that is grander. The activities and strategies themselves, however, arenot all that different.Thus, at one pole, lost in the mists of prehistory and countless myths andancient epics, an extraordinarily sophisticated and Very High Civilization blewitself apart eons ago in an interplanetary war, a war that cost them the veryscience that accounted for their fabulous wealth and power. In the wake of thatcataclysm, what was left of that civilization purposed to maintain as much ofthat lost knowledge as possible, and, eventually, to recover all of it. Thusarose the secret societies, mystery schools, and civilizations that bore thestamp of its legacy, among which were the two that shall be our focus here: theMesopotamian civilizations of Sumer, Babylonia, and Assyria on the one hand, andEgypt on the other. Certain elements within those societies quickly began theconsolidation and extension of their power, and, as a result, were able topreserve at least a portion of the scientific legacy of their more sophisticatedforebears, for that scientific legacy — distorted and blasted apart andfragmented as it was by that war — was indeed the very basis of their power.40[4372.xhtml#3408] The combatants of that war, both the “good guys” and the “badguys,” victors and vanquished, each to a certain extent went underground, theone seeking to preserve and recover the lost scientific bounty for the commongood, and the other to recover it to make yet another bid for hegemony and worldmastery. A sort of guerrilla and covert war between them — protracted formillennia — ensued, and, at times, even a détente was declared, for in theaftermath of that war, each to a certain extent needed the good offices andgraces of the other to survive. Détente, and yet, covert warfare: this is thedynamic with which we must perpetually contend throughout this book.At the other pole, in distinctly more modern times, but similarly, after yetanother and more familiar war, from May 29th to May 31st, 1954, the gildedbanking and corporate elites of Europe and North America met at a small hotel inOosterbeek, Holland called the Bilderberg,41 [4372.xhtml#3410] and ever since,this secretive annual gathering of the super-rich class of internationalbanksters has been known by the name where their first meeting was held: TheBilderberg Group. And they — or rather, the international class of the verywealthy that they represent — show all the classic signs of having understoodthe historical and scientific lessons of their Egyptian and Babylonianpredecessors, and more importantly, of their forebears of whom Egypt andBabylonia were but pale legacies.And the timing of the meeting — 1954 — is in itself worth some commentary, forsome allege that during 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower secretly met withan “extraterrestrial delegation” at a location in California. Others, however,maintain that Eisenhower was not really meeting with extraterrestrials at all,but with very terrestrial Nazis at their secret Argentine headquarters.42[4372.xhtml#3412] Moreover, that time period — ca. 1954 — is the same periodthat the United States Air Force showed a distinct, but highly secret, interestin the free-energy research of one Nazi scientist in Argentina, Dr. RonaldRichter and what it portended for advanced propulsion and energypossibilities.43 [4372.xhtml#3414] And, at the very same time period, discussionof anti-gravity physics disappeared in the open literature.44 [4372.xhtml#3416]If one takes the unusually synchronous timing of these disparate events assomething less than coincidental, and as somehow related to each other, thenclearly one implication is that there is a deep interest within financialcircles concerning deep physics. A struggle for financial, and technological,hegemony is subtly implied.It is between these two unlikely historical poles — an extremely ancient one,and a very contemporary one — that this story also moves.Very obviously, one is dealing here with something that, in modern times atleast, looks very much like a conspiracy. And like all conspiracies, it has its“factions,” groups vying for ultimate power that, for whatever reason andcombination of circumstances, momentarily and temporarily unites them to makecommon cause to achieve the agreed upon goal of global domination and hegemony.The conspirators, whoever they are, thus appear at both poles of the story,agreeing to lay down their arms after a terribly destructive war, and to makecommon cause for the immediate future. They agreed, in short, to a coexistence,to a détente.However, like all such détentes, this one is destined to break down. Thedisagreements, such as they are, may occur over the means and methods to achieveit, but ultimately and more importantly, they will occur — if they have notalready — over which faction will ultimately lead it. In this, the moderncircumstance resembles its “paleoancient” ancestor, the Very High Civilizationthat blew itself apart and then quickly established the legacy civilizations,the mystery schools and priestly fraternities and the monied class of merchantsand bullion brokers that would seek to use one aspect of that lost science — thefinancial and economic “alchemy” — to recover the other aspect of it, the lostphysics of the alchemical manipulation of the physical medium itself.Thus, there are two other poles between which this story moves: the first beingphysics, and the second being the economics of high finance and its alliedscience of “social engineering.” We have, then, four poles: two being temporalones, widely separated in time, and two conceptual or disciplinary ones,apparently widely separated by subject matter and method. For all the previousreasons, our story is partly an historical one, and partly a story about thatstrange intelligible world of very abstruse physics, of equally abstrusefinance, and of the even more abstruse relationship between the two. It is thusabove all an interdisciplinary story.So, before proceeding any further, let us be absolutely clear and certain ofwhat has been said, and what this book attempts to illustrate:1. There is both in ancient and in modern times an “international monied class”deriving its power from its understanding and manipulation of the science ofhigh finance, and from its monopolization of the money-creating power in its ownprivate hands;2. This class fought, at both ends of the historical pole, tremendouslydestructive wars. In the paleoancient45 [4372.xhtml#3418] instance, this war wasinterplanetary in nature, and resulted in the fragmentation of the physics andeconomics components of a highly unified and integrated scientific worldview, inwhich those components were once united;3. The result of that ancient cosmic war was the creation of legacycivilizations and secret organizations, in which that monied class swiftlyestablished itself, on the basis of the retention within those societies’ orbitsof knowledge of at least some aspects of their ancestors’ knowledge of thescience of high finance and of its relationship to physics;4. Thus established, this class has bent every effort toward the recovery of thephysics component of their ancestral scientific legacy, and has blocked allattempts of those who throughout the millennia have sought to recover it and toproliferate it among the masses. The reason they have blocked all such attemptsis quite simple, for once in the hands of the masses, their hegemony as a classwould be irretrievably, and once and forever, broken.So, in a sense, the paleoancient “Cosmic War” of which I have writtenextensively elsewhere, went underground. It became a covert war, a guerrillawar, and has been over the protracted millennia ever since a struggle betweenthose who wish to maintain their power by reconstructing that lost unity of highfinancial economics and physics and monopolizing it for themselves to enslavemankind, and those who seek not only to reconstruct that lost unity but to shareit, to “democratize” it among the great masses of humanity.This book thus not only moves between two poles widely separated by time, orbetween two disciplinary poles — physics and high finance — apparently widelyseparated by subject matter and method, but it is also about the dynamics ofthat conflict, one which the banksters, for reasons that will become apparent inthis book, are ultimately destined to lose, no matter what their extraordinarypower or the Byzantine subtlety of their plans and cabals might be.But surely, the reader will ask, to implicate the first meeting of theBilderberg Group in this grand millennia-old story is going a bit too far?On the contrary, the evidence points almost ineluctably toward that conclusion,but in order to see how, one must examine the Bilderberg meetings, andparticularly the very first ones, in more detail. For the purposes of thisexamination, no one has examined and exposed those meetings in more detail thanhas Daniel Estulin, and he will accordingly be reviewed here."},{"pageContent":"B. ESTULIN’S STUDY AND STANDARD INTERPRETATIONSEstulin is a Russian émigré to Canada who first became interested in theBilderberg group when he and others exposed the 1996 Bilderberg plot todismember Canada, and have portions of that country “absorbed” by the UnitedStates.46 [4372.xhtml#3420] Put on to the plot by a KGB agent whom Estulin calls“Vladimir,” he and his erstwhile informant barely escaped with their lives when,prior to stepping onto an elevator, his informant held him back and pointed outthat the elevator floor was missing!47 [4372.xhtml#3422] These two eventscompelled Estulin to uncover as much as he could about the secretive BilderbergGroup, and as a result, his study, The True Story of the Bilderberg Group, willbe followed closely here, for the case I believe it makes is ultimatelysomething very different than that Estulin, or other researchers of the Group,believes it to be.In order to see how, though, it is necessary to see what Estulin actuallyuncovered about the Group."},{"pageContent":"1. Estulin’s SourcesEstulin’s book is amply documented with numerous photos, actual pictures ofBilderberg invitations, and so on. But how did he acquire such inside knowledge?His answer is quite simple: “I could not have done this without the help of‘conscientious objectors’ from inside, as well as outside, the Group’smembership.”48 [4372.xhtml#3424] A little further on he elaborates on who someof these sources were: the very hotel staff — the cooks, bellboys, waiters,cleaners and other staff the Bilderbergers took such pains to vet!49[4372.xhtml#3426] And as has been seen, Estulin also received the considerablehelp of intelligence agents from Russia. This fact will play a major role in ourconclusions toward the end of the book, in that it indicates that foreignintelligence services, particularly of those nations and power blocs not underBilderberg influence, watch and analyze the plans of this self-appointed globalelite very carefully and closely."},{"pageContent":"2. Protocolsa. AttendeesSo who are the typical attendees of the Bilderberg meetings?According to Estulin, they are what one might expect of such a gathering of aself-appointed world elite:(They) are annually attended by Presidents of the International Monetary Fund,the World Bank, and Federal Reserve; by chairmen of 100 of the most powerfulcorporations in the world such as Daimler-Chrysler, Coca-Cola, British Petroleum(BP), Chase Manhattan Bank, American Express, Goldman Sachs, and Microsoft; byVice Presidents of the United States, Directors of the CIA and the FBI,Secretaries General of NATO, American Senators and members of Congress, EuropeanPrime Ministers, and leaders of opposition parties; and by top editors and CEOsof the leading newspapers in the world.50 [4372.xhtml#3428]Such a group, needless to say, reads like a who’s who of the western world’spower brokers:Every U.S. president since “Ike” Eisenhower has belonged to the BilderbergGroup, not that they have all attended the meetings personally, but all havesent their representatives. Another member is now ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair,as well as most of the principal members of the British government. EvenCanada’s high-profile past Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, was a member. PastBilderberg invitees are Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve;Hillary and Bill Clinton; John Kerry; Melinda and Bill Gates; and Richard Perle.Also members are the people who control what you watch and read — media baronslike David Rockefeller, Conrad Black (the now disgraced ex-owner of over 440media publications around the world from The Jerusalem Post to Canada’s newestdaily, The National Post), Edgar Bronfman, Rupert Murdoch, and Sumner Redstone,CEO of Viacom, an international media conglomerate that touches virtually everymajor segment of the media industry. They have protected the secrecy of thissecret society, and this may be why the name “Bilderberg” is new to you.51[4372.xhtml#3430]With such a concentration of political, financial, and media power, it isunderstandable that the meetings have, for the most part, been kept fairlysecret.But this list does not really tell the full story, for considerable thought isgiven to the invitees to each year’s gathering. For one thing, notes Estulin:It is important to distinguish between active members who assist annually andothers who are only invited occasionally. About eighty members are regulars whohave attended for many years. Fringe people, who are invited to report onsubjects related to their sphere of influence of professional and academicknowledge, are clueless about the formal structure behind the Bilderberg Group,and remain in absolute ignorance of the Group’s greater goals and universalobjectives. A select few are invited because the Bilderbergers think they may beuseful tools in their globalist plan and are later helped to reach very powerfulselected positions. One-time invitees who fail to impress, however, are castaside.52 [4372.xhtml#3432]Note what we have here:1. Regular attendees — people such as David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger —representing the major financial and political interests of the group;2. Occasional attendees or their representatives, representing a similar makeup,but only invited as the situation demands; and3. Professionals or academics, whose expertise is sought in certain situations,presumably to analyze and report on certain trends within the purview of theirexpertise, and presumably to make forecasts and “recommendations.”As we proceed, we shall see how each of these three groups break down in detail.For example, within each of these groups, a further breakdown occurs:Each country sends a delegation of, typically, three persons: an industry orbusiness leader, a top-level minister or a senator, and an intellectual or chiefeditor of the leading periodical. The United States has the most participantsbecause of its size. Smaller countries like Greece and Denmark are afforded, atmost, two seats. The conferences usually consist of a maximum of 130 delegates.Two-thirds of the attendees are from Europe, and the rest come from the UnitedStates and Canada. (Mexican globalists belong to a less powerful sisterorganization, the Trilateral Commission.)One-third of the delegates are from government and politics, and the remainingtwo-thirds from industry, finance, education, labor and communications. Mostdelegates are fluent in English, with French as their second language ofchoice.53 [4372.xhtml#3434]Thus, a little more analysis is necessary. Note the following preponderances:1. The Bilderberg Group is heavily weighted to a European point of view, thoughthe United States has the largest single representation of any country sendingdelegates;2. The Group is similarly weighted to the private sector rather than politics orgovernment, with finance, industry, labor and academia being the most prominentmembers.From this one may reasonably deduce that the Bilderberg Group, while ostensiblyattempting to create a “united front” of these various internal groups andinterests for a common cause, nonetheless contains within it two major factions,each of which has in turn two further factions within it:1. The “European” Faction2. The “North American” Faction (excluding Mexico).Within these two main factions, one discerns two further factions:a. The Political or Government Faction, stressing the role of publicinstitutions of power and the bureaucracies that inevitably accompany them;b. The Private Finance54 [4372.xhtml#3436] Faction, stressing the role of theprivate monopoly of money creation and its dominant role influencing other majorprivate sectors: labor, media, the academy, and so on.These four internal factions will become quite important when we turn toconsider the interpretation of the motivation for the actual founding of theBilderberg Group later in this chapter, for as we shall see, this author departssignificantly from the standard line of what its actual purposes, and power, maybe.Note one final thing from this analysis: the private European faction is thedominant faction in terms of representation. This is further evident from thefact that the Group, “from its inception, has been administered by a smallnucleus of persons, appointed since 1954 by a committee of ‘wise men,’ which ismade up of a European Chairman, both a European and a U.S. Secretary General,and Treasurer.”55 [4372.xhtml#3438]That stated, however, there is one more significant detail that Estulin adds tothis list of “typical Bilderberg attendees. Attendees, according to anunofficial Bilderberg press release, are drawn from a list of ‘important andrespected people who, through their special knowledge, personal contacts andinfluence in national and international circles, can amplify the objectives andresources of the Bilderberg Group.’”56 [4372.xhtml#3440] There are, principallywithin the categories of “private” attendees, six further typical profiles:1. industrialists;2. financiers; as we have already seen, but then the list gets interesting:3. ideologues;4. military professionals;5. “professional specialists” such as lawyers, journalists, doctors, and so on;and6. organized labor.57 [4372.xhtml#3442]What sort of ideologues, one might ask?Many people have attempted to answer that question, and in doing so haveattempted to analyze the true founding purposes and goals of the Group.Literature on the Bilderberg Group is therefore replete with documentation andspeculation of the types of ideologues suspected to attend their meetings,encompassing a broad spectrum from Fabian socialists, globalists, exponents ofWorld Government, animal and environmental activists, feminists, populationcontrol advocates, population reduction advocates, and so on.There is one type of ideologue, however, that is seldom mentioned, and when itis mentioned, even the most perspicacious conspiracy researcher more often thannot misses the significance of what it might indicate about the true foundingpurposes of the group, and the reasons for its very peculiar “union” of the fourpreviously mentioned factions. In doing so, even these few researchers fall preyto the typical “standard interpretation” — which we shall examine a little laterin this chapter — and attribute to the Group a monolithic structure and analmost omniscient and infallible power to accomplish its goals. In doing so,they tend to miss the recent and significant signals that there is seriousfactional infighting occurring within it and similar groups.But how does this shadowy group manage to keep its existence and meetingssecret? After all, a yearly meeting of the West’s elite and powerful that hasbeen ongoing since 1954 would surely cause some notice to break out, even intheir own closely controlled media organs.b. Vetting, Securing, and Announcing the LocationThe answer, of course, lies in the extraordinary security that surrounds notonly the meetings themselves, but more importantly, that surrounds thepreparations for them, from the selection of the location, to the timing of theannouncements of where the meeting is to be held.According to a source within the Steering Committee, “the invited guests mustcome alone; no wives, girlfriends, husbands or boyfriends. Personal assistants[translation: heavily armed bodyguards, usually ex-CIA and Secret IntelligenceService (SIS a.k.a. MI6)] cannot attend the conference and must eat in aseparate hall. Not even David Rockefeller’s personal assistant can join him forlunch. The guests are explicitly forbidden from giving interviews tojournalists.”To maintain their aura of hermeticism, Bilderbergers book a hotel for theduration of the conference, usually ranging from three to four days, with thewhole building being cleared of all other guests by the CIA and local secretservice to ensure complete privacy and safety for the delegates. All drawings ofthe layout of the hotel are classified, staff is thoroughly vetted, theirloyalty questioned, their backgrounds verified, and political affiliationschecked. Any suspect ones are removed for the duration.…The host national government takes care of all the security concerns of theattending guests and their entourage. It also pays the costs of the militaryprotection, the secret service, national and local police presence, as well asall additional private security to protect the intimacy and the privacy of theall-powerful world elite. The attendees are not required to follow theestablished rules and regulations of the host country, such as having to gothrough customs, carrying proper identification, such as passports, which arenot required on Bilderberg visits. When they meet, nobody who is not on the “in”is allowed to come near the hotel. The elite often bring their own chefs, cooks,waiters, secretaries, telephone operators, busboys, cleaning staff and securitypersonnel.58 [4372.xhtml#3444]As a further precaution, even though the timing of meetings is announced toinvitees four months in advance, the actual location of the meeting is not madeknown to them until only one week prior to its occurrence. Finally, alldocuments distributed to attendees is marked personally for them, and stamped“personal and strictly confidential, and not for publication.”59[4372.xhtml#3446]Observe carefully what this implies, for such a gathering of the super-rich andpowerful, with all the banking, media, and governmental contacts that thisinevitably brings with it, is not only a Group that is gathering intelligence,circulating and exchanging information, but that it has its own internalclassification system, for one might assume that the contents of suchpublications vary from delegation to delegation, if not between the individualattendees themselves. One may also assume that certain individuals receiverather more information — and thus have a higher “classification clearance” —than others.c. The Sessions and Their RulesEach meeting is divided into four daily sessions, “two in the morning and two inthe afternoon,” with the exception of Saturday afternoons which are left freefor leisure activities.60 [4372.xhtml#3448] When in session, the seating is by“rotatable alphabetical order,” with “A’s” sitting in front one year, and “Z’s”the next, and so on.61 [4372.xhtml#3450]All session meetings follow the Rules of the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs, under which the contents of discussions may be shared, but theidentities of individuals making statements, nor indeed, the identities of anyindividuals in attendance, may be revealed. Additionally, under these Rules, onemay not reveal that one received this information at the Bilderberg Group’smeetings.62 [4372.xhtml#3452]"},{"pageContent":"3. Goals and History: Bilderberg ShenanigansAs Estulin notes, the Bilderberg Group itself released a document in 1989 thatstated their first meeting, held in 1954,“grew out of the concern expressed by many leading citizens on both sides of theAtlantic that Western Europe and North America were not working together asclosely as they should on matters of critical importance. It was felt thatregular, off-the-record discussions would help create a better understanding ofthe complex forces and major trends affecting Western nations in the difficultpost-war period.”63 [4372.xhtml#3454]But there was another goal from the outset that lay hidden within this desiresimply to have “off-the-record discussions”:Lord Rothschild and Laurence Rockefeller, key members of two of the mostpowerful families in the world, personally handpicked 100 of the world’s elitefor the secret purpose of regionalizing Europe, according to Giovanni Angelli,the now-deceased head of Fiat, who also said “European integration is our goal,and where the politicians failed, we industrialists hope to succeed.”64[4372.xhtml#3456]Bear the goal of European integration in mind, for it will become an importantdata point in the interpretation of the real founding motivations behind theBilderberg Group in a moment.Within a mere 14 years of that first meeting in 1954, however, Bilderberg goals— with the European Common Market well on its way to becoming the EuropeanEconomic Union and finally the European Union — had taken on a somewhat grandervision:(A) comment made to the Bilderberger elite by George Ball during a presentationtitled “Internationalization of Business” at the April 26-28, 1968, Bilderbergmeeting in Mont Tremblant, Canada, provides a far more truthful and insightfulglimpse into the Group’s economic orientation. Ball, who was the Undersecretaryof State for Economic Affairs under JFK and Lyndon Johnson, a Steering Committeemember of the Bilderberg Group as well as a Senior Managing Director for LehmanBrothers and Kuhn Loeb Inc., defined what the new Bilderberger policy ofglobalization was going to be, and how it would shape the Group’s policy.“In essence,” writes Pierre Beaudry in Synarchy Movement of Empire, “Ballpresented an outline of the advantages of a new-colonial world economic orderbased on the concept of a world company, and described some of the obstaclesthat needed to be eliminated for its success. According to Ball, the first andmost important thing that had to be eliminated was the archaic politicalstructure of the nation state.”65 [4372.xhtml#3458]Estulin summarizes what this “world company” means in practical terms aboutBilderberger goals. According to him, they want:1. One International Identity;2. Centralized Control of the People;3. A Zero-Growth Society;4. A State of Perpetual Imbalance;5. Centralized Control of All Education;6. Centralized Control of All Foreign and Domestic Policies;7. Empowerment of the United Nations;8. Western Trading Bloc (a NAFTA-like union of North and South America);9. Expansion of NATO;10. One Legal System;11. One Socialist Welfare State.66 [4372.xhtml#3460]Bear in mind points 3 and 4 (Zero Growth and Perpetual Imbalance), as they willbear directly on our interpretation of the founding purposes for the Group alittle later on.These “modest” goals therefore influence the vetting process for who getsinvited to Bilderberg meetings. Estulin states that the Group’s SteeringCommittee simply looks “for a One World Order enthusiast and (a) … Socialist.”67[4372.xhtml#3462] This is yet another important clue, one that will assume greatsignificance as this book unfolds, for it means essentially that the BilderbergGroup’s worldview is an intellectually closed system; dissenting or opposingpoints of view are not even represented in the Group’s typical composition atany given meeting. As noted before, this gives a distinctively ideologicalcharacteristic to the Group’s composition. After all, all of them areideologues, and the ideology is, quite simply put, global domination by aself-appointed elite. The goal is simply “to rule the world with or without itsconsent, with guns or butter, without.”68 [4372.xhtml#3464]David Rockefeller, of course, is one of the principal movers and shakers in thiscooperative elitist effort to enslave mankind, and in 1972, he and protégéZbigniew Brzezinski founded the Trilateral Commission, a Bilderberg-like groupthat reached out to include Japan and the Orient within its ranks. The goal wasto create an “international alliance that would create strategies and policiesto consolidate the four pillars of power — ‘political, monetary, intellectualand ecclesiastical’ — under a central world government.”69 [4372.xhtml#3466] The“ecclesiastical” component is a long and murky part of this story, and in facttoo complicated to go into here as it would require a book of its own. Sufficeit to say that the Rockefeller Foundation is the source of many grants to ardentecumenical movement projects and has been a major supporter of the World Councilof Churches. That being said, however, as will be seen in part two of thepresent book, the alliance between the banksters and a cynical “temple elite”has been a very long one, stretching back to ancient times.In any case, at the 1991 Bilderberg meeting Rockefeller minced no words abouthis goals for a “supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and worldbankers, which is surely preferable to the national auto determination practicedin past centuries.”70 [4372.xhtml#3468] Given the inability of the BilderbergGroup to countenance viewpoints that do not fall into their “closed system”worldview, it is no surprise that it has taken active steps to remove fromprominence those who espouse and/or act upon opposing views.For example, the Bilderbergers opposed President Charles De Gaulle’s creation ofan independent French nuclear and thermonuclear arsenal because it threatened tomake France too independent and nationalistic on the world geopolitical stage.71[4372.xhtml#3470] Estulin also maintains that the Group was behind the removalof Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher because of her opposition to a currencyamalgamation between Great Britain and the rest of Europe and the loss ofnational sovereignty this would inevitably mean for her country.72[4372.xhtml#3472] Estulin even presents evidence that Italian Prime MinisterAldo Moro was murdered by the Group for similar reasons, and that HenryKissinger was implicated in the affair.73 [4372.xhtml#3474] Finally, accordingto Estulin the real reason behind the whole sordid Watergate affair and theresignation of President Richard M. Nixon was because he opposed the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a scheme that would lead inexorably tothe NAFTA agreements and the eventual amalgamation of the U.S.A., Canada, andMexico into a regional super-state.74 [4372.xhtml#3476]"},{"pageContent":"4. Tentative Conclusions and Implications: The Standard Interpretive TemptationAll these considerations lead many people to what I call the “standardinterpretive temptation” of the Bilderbergers and similar groups,75[4372.xhtml#3478] namely, that they constitute a more or less monolithic groupwhose power and competence is scarcely resistible, and whose planning andsubtlety is so comprehensive that they seldom fail in their goals, and mostimportantly, that they show little if any signs of serious fracture andfragmentation — of struggles for power — within their own circle. They are, in aword, a sort of hive or herd, and, adopting the hive and herd mentality forthemselves, they seek to extend it to the rest of the world as a means of theirown domination and hegemony.This hive/herd mentality of the Bilderberg Group reflects itself in the way thatit and all other such groups view the world economically, conceptually,physically, and politically, for in each of these four cases, they believe it tobe a closed system. Therefore, it is necessary to have a basic working idea ofwhat is meant by “closed systems” in each of these four senses.By a closed economic system is meant the idea that the world’s energy supply,upon which the financial system of the banksters is based, is founded uponnon-renewable energy sources such as oil, natural gas, and so on. Hence, thesystem is closed since the whole premise of the system is scarcity andnonrenewability. Because of this, “One Bilderberg objective is tode-industrialize the world by suppressing all scientific development, startingwith the United States. Especially targeted are the fusion experiments as afuture source of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.”76 [4372.xhtml#3480] Notethe profound implications of this closed-system economic paradigm, for itnecessitates that the Bilderberg and similar Groups must resort to activemeasures to suppress the scientific development of new theories and their alliedtechnologies that would shift the world’s energy supply — and hence thefinancial system — to a new basis, and a basis no longer needing to be reliantupon their own monopoly financial power to create the medium of exchange andcredit. These active measures would include, but need not be limited to, thefollowing:1. Suppression of physics theories implying an “open systems” basis for energy,such as any hyper-dimensional theory, zero- point energy theory, and so on, thatwould lead to technologies tapping into them. Such theories are inherently opensystems theories and the energy supplies they posit are virtually inexhaustible;hence the financial system would perforce undergo a dramatic metamorphosis,ending their financial money-and-credit creating monopoly, since finance itselfwould become an open system;2. Promotion of physics theories in the public “marketplace of ideas” that aredeliberately designed to “dead end,” i.e., make practical technological accessto such energy supplies “theoretically impossible” and thus close off scientificdebate and discussion, i.e., physics itself is made to be a conceptually closedsystem;3. Suppression of individuals, groups, corporations, or countries developingsuch energy systems, whether standard and conventional nuclear energy, to moreexotic energy sources such as controlled fusion and so-called “free energy”devices;4. Promotion of so-called “energy-efficient” technologies that are basicallynothing but expensive “upgrades” of the current technologies and energy systems,leaving their monopoly financial power intact and unthreatened.These considerations lead almost inexorably to a consideration of the next senseof “closed systems,” to the “conceptually closed system.”As has already been indicated, the type of physics actively promoted by theGroup will be deliberately designed to “dead end,” i.e., it will be one of twothings. It will either be a closed-system physics, or an open-system physicsthat is impractical and even theoretically impossible to engineer for theforeseeable future. Hence, the Group’s own internal dynamics will not only beconceptually closed to all such theories, but will extend itself across therange of human experience, and conceptualization, since a practicallyengineerable open-systems physics implies the democratization not only ofenergy, but its corollaries, finance and political power, across a very broadspectrum of people, as a greater mass of people would be lifted up to greaterwealth, freedom, and prosperity. The Group, then, evidences the effect of itsown closed-system physics, by advocating closed and monopolized systems offinance and politics. This was reflected in the fact that the Group recruitsonly those who share its view and goals, as we have seen.And this highlights its first major weakness, for being committed ratherunscientifically to such a closed system in which progress is to be shunned andsuppressed, the Group shows that it is incapable of adaptability to changingcircumstances that are not under its own control. In short, it cannot evolve andis therefore destined to stagnate, wither, and die.This fact evidences a further problem that the Group has, and it is one to whichI have averred in previous books and radio talk show interviews, and that is the“proliferation problem.” Estulin outlines this problem in the following fashion:Why is nuclear energy hated so much by the New World Order? According to JohnColeman, a former British MI6 secret agent, nuclear power stations generatingabundant cheap electricity are “The key to bringing Third World countries out oftheir backward state. With nuclear energy generating electricity in cheap andabundant supplies, Third World countries would gradually become independent ofU.S. foreign aid, which keeps them in servitude, and begin to assert theirsovereignty.Less foreign aid means less control of a country’s natural resources by the IMF,and greater freedom and independence for the people. It is this idea ofdeveloping nations taking charge of their own destinies that is repugnant to theBilderbergers and their surrogates.This was confirmed on page 13 of the Bilderberg 1955 General Report: “In thefield of atomic energy, scientific discovery was continually overtaking itself….It could not be excluded that the scientists would put the bomb into the handsof more and more people and so ‘the atomic bomb would become the arm of thepoor.’ The same applied to the development of atomic energy for peacefulpurposes, where we had almost to foresee the unforeseeable.”77 [4372.xhtml#3482]In other words, part of the concern of the Bilderbergers in the decade or sofollowing World War II, was the apparent ease by which atomic energy — and henceatom bombs — could proliferate beyond their ability to control. It would, to putit mildly, be a political nightmare, as smaller nations could conceivably holdthe rest of the world under a kind of nuclear blackmail. In short, some of theirreasons for scientific suppression were indeed altruistic.However, there all altruism ends, for a virtual Western monopoly on such weaponsat that time in the immediate postwar period also gave the Group a final “threatof last resort” against the very people and world it sought and still seeks toenslave. And this brings us back to the other problem: open-systems physics andenergy sources. As we shall see subsequently in this book, such systems arerelatively easy things to engineer, and moreover, such a physics, if weaponized,would potentially be capable of making a hydrogen bomb look like a firecracker.The Group must therefore seek not only to suppress public exploration anddevelopment of this physics from a proliferation standpoint, but it must alsoseek to develop it privately for itself, giving it yet another monopoly on atechnology of hegemony. This too, as we shall see, is yet another link to theancient past.There is one final consequence of such a closed-system view of physics,economics, and finance, and that is that it leads to perpetual war,78[4372.xhtml#3484] since ever-dwindling resources are being sought by ever morecompeting interests. Nor is the Group immune from this, since scarcity willinevitably bring about severe factional infighting, as one faction demands moreresources than the projected “World Government” or “World Company” wishes toprovide it.79 [4372.xhtml#3486] Eventually, within such a closed-systemphysico-economic order, the system must devour the world and finally itself.It is, by its own lights and philosophy, inevitably doomed.If anything emerges from these brief considerations it is this: in the emergingglobal community, an open-system physics is ultimately the key to open systemsof economics, to open conceptual systems, and to open systems of politics andfinance. This deep and profound relationship between physics, finance, andpolitical order is, of course, not unknown to the Bilderberg Group or other suchgroups, as their own active suppression of such physics and cognate technologiesattests.80 [4372.xhtml#3488] The real question that shall preoccupy usthroughout the remainder of this book is exactly why that relationship shouldeven exist, to outline its salient features, and to examine certain aspects ofhow it has manifest itself in history."},{"pageContent":"C. UNUSUAL GUESTS AT THE FIRST MEETING, AND THE ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION: DETENTEAs previously indicated, the standard interpretation of the Group and itssurrogates as a monolithic, omnicompetent and omnipotent bloc does not take intoaccount some very significant facts that bear directly upon the interpretationof those early Bilderberger meetings, including especially the first ones ca.1954-1960. These facts may be distinguished into three classes:1. The presence of two unusual guests, with prominent Nazi backgrounds, at thefirst meetings;2. The wider context of postwar survival of a Nazi International and itsfinancial and political capital and objectives;3. The occurrence of events — subsequent to the first Bilderberg meeting —indicative of some sort of understanding between the Anglo-American bankingelite and the Nazi International, each of which had their own globalist agendafor world domination.Each of these points must be examined in some detail in order to appreciatetheir significance for an understanding of at least one of the probable purposesfor the establishment of the Bilderberg Group."},{"pageContent":"1. Two Prominent Guests with Nazi BackgroundsMost researchers on the Bilderberg Group have noticed the presence of PrinceBernhard of the Netherlands as the instigator and chairman of one of its firstmeetings in the 1950s, and some, Jim Marrs for example, have also noted thatBernhard was a former SS officer, as well as a vice president for the notoriousand gargantuan German chemicals cartel I.G. Farben.81 [4372.xhtml#3490] Butthere is another significant figure present in those first meetings as well, andit is the combination of these two men that indicate there may have been yetanother hidden purpose in the founding of the Bilderberg Group.That man is Deutschebank chairman, Sovereign Military Order of Malta member, andI.G. Farben, Daimler-Benz, and Siemens board of directors member, Dr. HermannJosef Abs.82 [4372.xhtml#3492]In addition to these directorships on Germany’s most powerful and largest bankand some of its largest corporations including Siemens and I.G. Farben, Abs,during his tenure as a partner of the private bank of Delbruck, Schickler andCo., located in Berlin, became a close associate of Nazi Party Reichsleiter andfinancial genius Martin Bormann, since Abs’ private bank was the very bank thatmanaged the accounts for the Reichschancellery, and thus paid Adolf Hitler’ssalary as Chancellor!83 [4372.xhtml#3494]"},{"pageContent":"2. The Wider Context of the Postwar Nazi International and The Name“Bilderberger” GroupBut there is a deeper implication to Abs’ presence at the Bilderberg meetings,along with fellow I.G. Farben officer Prince Bernhard, than even this “friendly”relationship with Martin Bormann would indicate. This deeper implication isclearly suggested by the role that Deutschebank played in moving the massiveamount of funds overseas that were a component of Martin Bormann’s “StrategicEvacuation Plan,” first outlined for the Nazi and German corporate leadership ata top secret meeting held in Strasbourg, France, in August of 1944.84[4372.xhtml#3496]As I wrote in one of my previous books, Nazi International, seven things emergedas a consequence of this meeting:1. Bormann basically confiscated any foreign reserves in the possession ofGerman corporations and placed them under the control of the Nazi Party;2. These funds in turn would be disbursed to corporations in aid of theirfulfillment of the goals of the conference;3. One primary goal was to establish “research bureaus” whose purpose, followingthe I.G. Farben N.W. 7 model, was to gather intelligence and steal foreignresearch as well as to conduct their own research;4. Since these technical offices were to have their own Nazi Party liaisonofficer reporting directly to Bormann, it is clear that Bormann intended for hisNazi International to conduct not only espionage but research in its own right,under departments — the “technical offices” — of German corporations only veryloosely connected to them;5. Each such research bureau was to be established under a cloak of otheractivity, such as “investigating water resources”;6. The capital flight program was designed to see to it that Allied authoritiesdid not get the most valuable German scientists, technicians, or knowledge, asrepresented in patents, all of which were to be transferred overseas to safehavens, thus indicating that Bormann, in the light of all the previouslyenumerated considerations, intended for the Party to continue an independentline of scientific research under its own control, all the while managing andsharing any information gained through its espionage activities with theinvolved German corporations, as the Party and Bormann saw fit.And all this implies something else, something very obvious, and verysignificant:7. Martin Bormann fully intended to survive the war in order to coordinate allthese activities.85 [4372.xhtml#3498]Note the significant point of establishing “research bureaus” under thedirection of Nazi Party liaison officers who, in turn, gathered intelligence,oversaw ongoing postwar Nazi research activities, and who reported directly toBormann! By extension then, the presence of SS Officer Prince Bernhard as notonly a founder of the Bilderberger Group, but as the first chairman of its firstmeeting, and the presence of Bormann’s banker, Dr. Hermann Josef Abs, in latermeetings, himself a Farben director along with Prince Bernhard, is a strongindicator that the Bilderberg Group may have been founded as yet another“liaison office” for Bormann’s Nazi International, allowing it not only theopportunity to sit down behind closed doors and “exchange information” with itschief rival for power — the Anglo-American banking elite — but to maintain aconstant flow of intelligence on its activities and goals.86 [4372.xhtml#3500]It was, in short, a marriage of convenience to move and launder massive amountsof money through the Anglo-American elite’s corporations and banks. And as withall such deals with the devil, Bormann’s money also carried with it the impliedthreat that someday the “markers would come due.”There is some corroborative evidence for this interpretation even in Estulin’sbook itself:Most reports contend the original members named their alliance the BilderbergGroup after the hotel where they made their covenant. Author Gyeorgos C. Hatonn,however, discovered that German-born Prince Bernhard was an officer in theReiter SS Corp in the early 1930s and was on the board of an I.G. Farbensubsidiary, Farben Bilder. In his book, Rape of the Constitution; Death ofFreedom, Hatonn claims Prince Bernhard drew on his Nazi history in corporatemanagement to encourage the “super secret policy-making group to call themselvesthe Bilderbergers after Farben Bilder, in memory of the Farben executives’initiative to organize Heinrich Himmler’s “Circle of Friends” — elitewealth-building leaders who amply rewarded Himmler for his protection underNational Socialist programs, from the early days of Hitler’s popularity throughto Nazi Germany’s defeat. The royal Dutch family discreetly buried this part ofPrince Bernhard’s background when, after the war, he became a top official inRoyal Dutch Shell, a Dutch-British conglomerate. Today, this rich European oilcompany forms part of the inner circle of the Bilderberg elite.87[4372.xhtml#3502]There, however, Estulin leaves matters, never to return to the potentialimplications this information signals.These potential implications are signaled, once again, by Abs’ presence as aBilderberger, and to see what it is, we have to look a little closer at thepostwar relationship between him, Bormann, and the North American faction of theBilderberg Group that is implicated in a little-known incident."},{"pageContent":"3. An Event Indicative of an Understanding between the Anglo-American CorporateGlobalist Elite and the Nazi InternationalThis incident is a clear indicator that the Bilderberg Group’s early foundingwas for the purposes of striking a kind of “détente” between the two old rivals,the Nazi International and the Anglo-American elite, since both shared similargoals, and both had access to a lot of money. The incident was disclosed bylongtime CBS journalist and Ed Morrow associate Paul Manning, in his book MartinBormann: Nazi in Exile. Manning recounts a little-known effort by U.S. SupremeCourt Justice Jackson, who had obtained fame as America’s chief prosecutorduring the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunals, and President Harry S. Truman, totrack down the Nazi Party Reichsleiter. I recounted this effort in my book TheNazi International as follows:Paul Manning, a journalist and longtime associate and friend of the famous CBSnewsman Ed Morrow, mentioned Bormann’s presence in Bariloche province, but didnot connect his appearance with the Richter fusion project. Manning begins bynoting that President Truman himself became involved in the hunt for Bormann in1948, three long years after Bormann supposedly died trying to escape Berlin,according to the “official standard” history:On June 16, 1948, President Truman became involved in the hunt for MartinBormann. Robert H. Jackson, who had once taken a leave from the Supreme Court toserve as U.S. chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, wrote to the presidentthat a quiet search should be made by the FBI for Bormann in South America.“My suggestion, therefore,” he wrote, “is that the FBI be authorized to pursuethoroughly discreet inquiries of a preliminary nature in South America…. I havesubmitted this summary to Mr. Hoover and am authorized to say that it meets withhis approval. You may inform him of your wishes directly or through me, as youprefer.”88 [4372.xhtml#3504]The choice of the FBI to do the investigation is perhaps significant. UnderAmerican federal law after Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 thatcreated the CIA and NSA, the FBI was restricted to intelligence operations onAmerican soil. All operations on foreign soil fell under the jurisdiction of theCIA. So why would Jackson have urged President Truman to undertake aninvestigation in South America through the FBI? After all, Truman himself signedthe law into existence and knew full well its contents.The answer lies once again in the fact that the CIA, which, under Zurich OSSstation chief Allen Dulles during the war, had negotiated a highly secret dealwith the head of German military intelligence on the Eastern Front, GeneralReinhard Gehlen, to turn over — lock, stock, and Nazi — Gehlen’s entire networkto the nominal oversight of the American intelligence community, leaving Gehlenin charge of its actual day-to-day operations. In other words, before the inkwas even dry on the National Security Act of 1947, the CIA’s “civiliancharacter” had already been compromised in the most egregious way, since itsentire operational desk in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and to a greatextent elsewhere as well, was staffed by a network of Nazis! Needless to say,then, the CIA would not be the best instrumentality to investigate Bormann’spossible presence in Latin America! Jackson’s request also suggests somethingeven darker: that both he and Truman knew of the extent of Nazi penetration ofthe CIA, and therefore of its untrustworthiness as an investigative agency forpostwar Nazi activity.In any case, as Manning observes:“The presidential authorization was given, and John Edgar Hoover assigned theinvestigation to his most experienced and skillful agent in South America, whoproved that he was just that by eventually obtaining copies of the MartinBormann file that were being held under strict secrecy by Argentina’s Ministerof the Interior in the Central de Intelligencia. When the file (now in mypossession) was received at FBI headquarters, it revealed that the Reichsleiterhad indeed been tracked for years. One report covered his whereabouts from 1948to 1961, in Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil and Chile. The file revealed that he hadbeen banking under his own name from his office in Germany in Deutsche Bank ofBuenos Aires since 1941; that he held one joint account with the Argentiniandictator Juan Perón, and on August 4, 5, and 14, 1967, had written checks ondemand accounts in First National City Bank (Overseas Division) of New York, TheChase Manhattan Bank, and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., all cleared throughDeutsche Bank of Buenos Aires.”89 [4372.xhtml#3506]Bormann’s wartime contact with Deutsche Bank bigwig Dr. Hermann Abs, and theconnections to the international financial interests of Morgan and Rockefellervia their big New York banks, was paying big dividends, for Bormann quiteapparently did not even have to hide his identity, but could sign and cashchecks under his own name through some of the largest and most well-known banksin America as late as 1967!90 [4372.xhtml#3508]Observe carefully the dynamic here:1. Bormann has accounts after the war in large American banks representing theRockefeller-Morgan interest;2. He is able to draft checks on those accounts and cash them under his own name22 years after the end of the war;3. Those checks are cleared through his bank, Deutschebank, through its localBuenos Aires office in Argentina!We have thus a Bormann-Abs-Rockefeller network, and this clearly implies thatthe two financial elites, represented by their respective delegations to thoseearly Bilderberg meetings, have reached some sort of modus vivendi. The questionis, why?"},{"pageContent":"4. Closed Systems, Open Systems, and Further Possible Reasons for the DétenteA clue to the answer is afforded in part by the fact that the immediate postwargoals of the Nazi International and the Anglo-American elite are one and thesame: the creation of a European federation under German economic dominance. JimMarrs, in his bestselling book The Rise of the Fourth Reich, puts it this way:After the war a devastated Europe looked to Germany for economic leadership. Theeconomic steps taken that became the Common Market took the shape of prewar Naziplans. “(S)omehow the Gernans had the answer originally in 1942 when they weremelding the economic institutions of the Continent into their own design,” notedManning.It is interesting to note that the present European Union (EU) began as merelyeconomic measures.…The European Economic Community, better known as the Common Market, wasestablished in 1957 by the Treaty of Rome…. George McGhee, a member of thesecretive Bilderberg Group and former U.S. ambassador to West Germanyacknowledged that “the Treaty of Rome, which brought the Common Market intobeing, was nurtured at Bilderberg meetings.”91 [4372.xhtml#3510]And needless to say, the ultimate goal of world domination was a goal sharedboth by the North American Faction and the Nazi International, and hence, bothcould afford to make common cause, to come to an agreement of “détente” and“coexistence” at those first Bilderberg Group meetings.But there is yet another reason such a détente was not only sought by bothfactions, but in a sense, altogether necessary: money. The rebuilding of Europe,not to mention its integration, would require money, and lots of it, and therewere two groups — The North American Bilderberg faction, and the NaziInternational — that had it in abundance. For Bormann to “grow” the substantialmonies that his Nazi Party had plundered from Europe, he would have to haveaccess to the international banking community and its banks in Britain and NorthAmerica. Conversely, such vast influx of liquid cash and hard commodities suchas gold, diamonds, and platinum, which Bormann’s Nazi International had inabundance,92 [4372.xhtml#3512] would constitute a reserve that would greatlyexpand the Rockefeller-Morgan-Rothschild banks’ ledger credit-making ability,enriching them in the process.It was, inevitably, a “détente” made in banksters’ heaven.And Bilderberg was the result.There is, however, a final reason for the détente, one that once againdemonstrates the deep connection of finance and physics.For Bormann’s Nazi International to maintain this détente for such a long periodafter the war — after all, according to Manning and the Argentine intelligenceservice, he cashed checks on Rockefeller-Morgan banks via Deutschebank in 1967 —he would have to have had powerful coercive “leverage” with which to ensure thatthe Anglo-American faction lived up to its part of the deal. Part of this nodoubt came from the implicit threat afforded by the vast intelligence resourcesavailable to him: General Gehlen’s old German military intelligence unit, nowthe nucleus of West Germany’s Bundesnachrichtendienst, the Nazi Party’s ownsignificant intelligence network, and so on. The mere existence of such anetwork would convey the threat that if the other faction did not behaveaccording to their agreements, its leaders could be very easily assassinated.93[4372.xhtml#3514] There is, however, another bit of leverage Bormann’s NaziInternational controlled, and it was one piece of leverage that its rival NorthAmerican faction dearly wished to possess: alternative physics.Over the course of four previous books on wartime Nazi secret weapons research —Reich of the Black Sun, The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, Secrets of the UnifiedField, and The Nazi International — I have detailed the story of the Nazi Belldevice, a hyper-dimensional physics device being researched under the auspicesof the SS departments Entwicklungstelle-IV(Development Area IV), Forschung,Entwicklung, und Patente (Research, Development, and Patents), and SS GeneralHans Kammler’s super-secret weapons black projects think-tank, theKammlerstab.94 [4372.xhtml#3516] As the mission brief of the EntwicklungstelleIV was to develop free energy and to make Germany independent of foreign oil,95[4372.xhtml#3518] and as the latter two departments were responsible for theBell itself (a device I believe to have been designed for a threefold purpose:to investigate that same “free energy,” to explore the possibilities of advancedfield propulsion concepts, and finally, as a weapon that had the potential tomake even the largest thermonuclear bombs pale by comparison for destructivepotential),96 [4372.xhtml#3520] this device and the alternative physics itrepresented and embodied were a clear threat to the closed-systems approach ofat least the North American faction within the Bilderberg Group and similargroups. As I also detail in The Nazi International, Bormann saw to it that whilethe Allies and Soviets received an almost equal and stalemating division of thetechnological spoils of the Third Reich, this device he retained for the NaziInternational, and continued a line of independent investigation of itsphysics.97 [4372.xhtml#3522]This independent investigation was headquartered in Argentina, near the remotecity of San Carlos de Bariloche in Rio Negro province, some 900 miles southwestof Buenos Aires. Ostensibly a project investigating techniques for controllingthermonuclear fusion, it had evidently achieved some success, as dictator JuanPerón made an announcement in 1951 to this effect.98 [4372.xhtml#3524] Furtherinvestigation, however, revealed that the ultimate goal of the project was farbeyond this, as the project’s head, Dr. Ronald Richter, viewed controlled fusionand plasma processes as a way to manipulate and the zero point energy, thefabric of space-time itself.99 [4372.xhtml#3526]For our purposes here, however, it is important to note that the United Statesshows an interest in Richter’s project some four years after it was shut down byBormann and his Nazi International.100 [4372.xhtml#3528] This fact, plus thefact, according to Bell researcher Igor Witkowski, that after the war the UnitedStates made every effort to reconstruct the personnel team that worked on theBell,101 [4372.xhtml#3530] and that it also even went so far as to launch amilitary commando raid into Czechoslovakia in 1946 to recover documentsdoubtless relating to General Kammler’s secret weapons group,102[4372.xhtml#3532] is a strong indication that the Anglo-American faction knew ina general fashion of the existence of this alternative physics in postwar Nazihands, and was attempting to recover as much of it for themselves as possible,and break Bormann’s monopoly hold over it and restore a “balance of power,”albeit a covert one, between the two factions.103 [4372.xhtml#3534] Needless tosay, there is also every indication that the Soviets and Allies began a crashprogram after the war to investigate similar lines of physics for themselves.104[4372.xhtml#3536]This indicates a possible final reason for the détente: Bormann’s NaziInternational could literally dangle portions of that physics and its cognatetechnologies before his erstwhile allies’ noses, and dole it out piecemeal, ifhe so chose, in return for “favors.” And this hints at a potential internaldynamic within the factions represented by the Bilderberg Group, for eachfaction would seek not only to suppress public development of such physics andtechnologies, but also seek to inhibit the other faction’s development of it aswell."},{"pageContent":"5. An Analogy of the Détente: The 1939 Nazi-Soviet PactAn apt analogy of this situation is afforded by the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939,the pact that secretly divided Poland into Nazi and Soviet “spheres ofinfluence” and made World War II possible. Both regimes being what they were,both took cynical advantage of the geopolitical situation, fully knowing that atsome future time the two nations would probably come to blows. The pact wassimply a “détente,” a “coexistence” wherein both sides agreed not to go to warwith each other, allowing a period of time during which each could build up itsforces to do precisely that!For reasons that were in part outlined in the prologue and to be exploredsubsequently, this author believes that within the last decade or so, there aredistinct signs that that the postwar détente within the Bilderberg Group isbreaking down, and that there is quiet, though very serious, covert war beingwaged between the various factions of that international corporate elite.105[4372.xhtml#3538]"},{"pageContent":"6. Closed Systems, Globalization, New Energy Sources, and Outer SpaceBut what are the practical implications of this “closed system” approach tophysics and economics?For the conspirators adopting them and imposing them on the rest of the world,they are very simple. In the first instance, that of “globalization,” a closedglobal economic order will eventually devour itself, and therewith, theconspirators themselves. Knowing this, they have two possible alternatives: (1)development of new energy sources which they can monopolize, a risky prospect aswe shall see, or (2) they can “open” the system up a bit, and venture into outerspace, creating a potential “competitor,” while simultaneously promotingfactional and regional imbalances on the earth which they can manipulate andcontrol, and maintain the illusion that the economy is perking along nicely (asthey have done in the past). Both components of this stratagem are themselvesfraught with risks as well, for in promoting regional imbalances and factionalinfighting, they run the risk that they will eventually lose control of them,and that the unitary closed global system will fragment, and their power becorrespondingly diminished."},{"pageContent":"D. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONSSo what may one conclude from this examination of the real purposes behind theBilderberg Group?As we have seen, the following points now evidence themselves:1. There is a deep and profound connection between the closed-systems approachof finance and politics advocated by such international groups of the corporateelite, and closed-systems physics;2. This connection necessitates that any internal factions within it seek tosuppress the open and public development of such physics, as well as tomonopolize it for themselves and deny it to other factions;3. Any such group must also seek to extend its influence over the other areas ofpower: academia, labor, and, as we saw from David Rockefeller’s remarks,religion. This will figure prominently in part two in our examination of whyancient temples functioned also as centers for the then banking class;4. In the wake of World War II, an apparent détente was struck between two majorfactions — the Anglo-American, and the Nazi International or European faction —as a result of the pressing need for channeling vast amounts of Nazi plunderback into Europe, and as the North American Group and the European group eachused the meetings to gather intelligence on the other, and keep abreast of itsactivities.With these observations, we have seen at one end of the historical pole theinterrelationships of closed and open systems, of the banking elite, and of thenecessity for it to suppress the development of open-systems physics that wouldlead to open financial systems. We have moreover suggested that there is seriousfactional polarization and tension within that class hiding just beneath thesurface, and able to break out into open conflict given certain circumstances.It is now time to press our examination a little further back into history,toward the Great Depression, and a hidden, little-known and little appreciatedlegacy of one of America’s most unpopular Presidents. Thereby we will beafforded the perspective by which to perceive quite clearly theinterrelationships of physics and economics itself, and to track thatrelationship even further back into history."},{"pageContent":"TwoHOOVER’S HIDDEN LEGACY AND GIFTINDICATORS OF A LOST SCIENCE[5699.jpeg]All our chart can tell us is that, failing a revolution of some sort, thepattern as established will presumably prevail.”— Edward R. Dewey and Edwin F. Dakin106 [4372.xhtml#3540]No President of the United States of America has gone down in history morelamented, and even excoriated, than has Herbert Hoover, whose twin misfortuneswere first to have presided over the country at the beginning of the GreatDepression, and secondly, to have been such an ardent free-market ideologue thathe genuinely thought there was nothing he nor the government could nor should doto alleviate the suffering of those who had lost their savings, farms, and homesduring the crisis. In this he came the closest of any American chief executiveto the attitude of Marie Antoinette who, upon hearing of the plight of France’spoor being unable to purchase adequate food and bread, is reported to have saidmerely, “Let them eat cake.” His presidency thus came to epitomize the popularperception that the U.S.A. was a government of Wall Street, by Wall Street, andfor Wall Street. Marie Antoinette, of course, lost her head over the matter.Hoover managed to retain his head, but was expelled from the presidency in 1932in an election that swept Franklin Delano Roosevelt into office. But Hoover didleave one enduring legacy of his attempt to find a genuinely long-term solutionto the problem of “boom-and-bust” business cycles that had plagued Americanhistory, and it is a legacy few people even know exists. And even among the fewthat do know of its existence, even fewer of them know its true significance.That legacy was Edward R. Dewey, and his legacy, the Foundation for the Study ofCycles.Dewey’s interest in cycles began when Hoover, beset by the misery the GreatDepression was inflicting on so many Americans, wanted to know the cause of it,and assigned the U.S. Department of Commerce the task of finding it out. Theassignment fell to Dewey, who was at that time the Chief Economic Analyst of theCommerce Department.107 [4372.xhtml#3542] Seeking out the assistance of variouseconomists, he lost faith in standard methods of economics when they could notprovide him with coherent and consistent answers and models. Having access tothe vast amounts of information available to him from the Commerce Department,Dewey adopted a novel approach. Rather than concerning himself with the whys andcauses of depressions, he decided to study how economic and business cyclesoccurred. He decided, in other words, to study the what, and not the why,108[4372.xhtml#3544] and in doing so, he discovered something very significant.He discovered that cycles, waves of behavior, existed in almost all aspects ofeconomic and human social life, from the prices of pig iron to human emotionsthemselves. According to the Foundation for the Study of Cycles’ website itself,Dewey learned of a “1931 Canadian conference on biological cycles. Under theguidance of Dewey and the conference leader, Copley Amory, the conference’sPermanent Committee was organized into the Foundation for the Study of Cycles,and its scope was enlarged to encompass all disciplines.”109 [4372.xhtml#3546]Having access to this expanded database led to the Foundation’s establishment in1941, and it has continued to gather hard empirical evidence on all manner ofcycles in all possible disciplines ever since. The work of the Foundationcontinued in Dewey’s tradition, gathering evidences of the what rather than thewhy, though inevitably, as we shall see, the vast and overwhelming amount ofdata it accumulated led to some of its members trying to work out acomprehensive theory of the causes of these cycles, of the why.In any case, this was Hoover’s lasting legacy — a profoundly positive thoughunsung one — from the Great Depression and his otherwise blighted presidency,for it led in 1947 to the first “comprehensive” publication of what theFoundation had discovered. This was a book co-authored by Dewey and hisassociate, Edwin F. Dakin, called Cycles: The Science of Prediction.110[4372.xhtml#3548] It is by means of this book that we shall gain our initialentrance into the deep physics connection between cycles of human behavior,economics, and energy technologies."},{"pageContent":"A. AN OVERVIEW OF DEWEY’S DATABASEAnyone reading Dewey’s and Dakin’s Cycles: The Science of Prediction willimmediately be struck by the sheer amount of data — which is but a tiny fractionof the data gathered by the Foundation in its decades of research! — that iscrammed into its comparatively short 255 overstuffed pages. There are graphs ofthe growth curves of pumpkins, yeast cells, and fruit flies,111[4372.xhtml#3550] of whole countries like Sweden, the United States,112[4372.xhtml#3552] France, Algeria,113 [4372.xhtml#3554] of populations, ofmanufactures,114 [4372.xhtml#3556] of exports and imports,115 [4372.xhtml#3558]of the growth of railroads, shipbuilding, and automobile building industries,116[4372.xhtml#3560] of cattle, corn, cotton, wool, wheat, malt liquor, lumber, andcotton spindle production, coal, copper and lead production,117[4372.xhtml#3562] of airplane and natural gas production,118 [4372.xhtml#3564]of paper and wood pulp production.119 [4372.xhtml#3566] There are charts of therises and fall of Atlantic salmon populations,120 [4372.xhtml#3568] of lynx andtent caterpillar population cycles,121 [4372.xhtml#3570] even of the cycle ofozone levels at London and Paris.122 [4372.xhtml#3572]There are charts of 54-year periodic cycles in wholesale prices, wages, andinterest-bearing securities, of coal production in England and coal consumptionin France, of pig iron and lead production in England.123 [4372.xhtml#3574]There are charts and graphs of nine-year cycles of prices in manufactured goods,common stocks, wholesale prices.124 [4372.xhtml#3576] There arethree-and-a-half-year cycles of industrial production and common stockprices,125 [4372.xhtml#3578] 18-year cycles of real estate activity, housing andbuilding construction,126 [4372.xhtml#3580] marriages, wheat acreage, bricks,127[4372.xhtml#3582] of construction in Hamburg, Germany, of skyscrapers in NewYork City and Chicago,128 [4372.xhtml#3584] loans and discounts and railroadstock prices,129 [4372.xhtml#3586] and on and on it goes.130 [4372.xhtml#3588]What emerged from all this vast accumulation of data was that the growth curveof things — no matter what they were, from yeast cultures to countries — was thesame, and that there were discernible wave forms, cycles, of varying years’duration, in all manner of things, from stock prices to ozone levels toatmospheric electricity, and that these cycles were not only discernible butquantifiable because they were regular. And because they were regular, they werenot only inevitable but also predictable. As we shall see, in this inevitabilityand predictability, there lies quite a tale, for that story is in fact what thisbook is about.But needless to say, the possession of such a database, not to mention itspotential in the hands of those who knew about it, made it a “tool to possess”for those who stood to benefit financially and politically from such knowledge,and this in turn may account for the fact that, while a public foundation, fewpeople actually know about it, and fewer still have an inkling of what its vastdatabase implies about the structure of the physical world, and about those whowould, through technological means, manipulate that structure for whateverpurpose, and, in this regard, one need only recall that Dr. David Li’s Gaussiancopula formula was precisely a technique of such manipulation. But we get somemeasure, perhaps, of the Foundation’s true importance and the true significanceof its research by the presence within its membership and lists of publishedpapers of at least one member of a prominent international bank. For example, inits library of available papers on its internet website, one finds the followinginteresting catalogue of papers, and these, again, are but a few of thosepublicly available. There are many more available to members of the Foundation:1. A paper by Theodor Landscheidt, Director of the Schroeter Institute forResearch in Cycles of Solar Activity, Nova Scotia, entitled “Cosmic Regulationof Cycles in Nature and the Economy.” The short abstract of this paper is alsoilluminating, for the paper is about “cycles in nature that can be understoodand predicted, and that are connected with human behavior, especially in theeconomy.”131 [4372.xhtml#3590] Note that what is implied here is a directrelationship between solar cycles and human economic activity.2. A paper by Ray Tomes, Director, Advanced Management Systems, Ltd., in NewZealand, entitled “Towards a Unified Theory of Cycles.” The short abstract ofthis paper is equally illuminating, for it states that “Evidence suggests thatearth-based cycles are caused by lunar and solar effects on earth’s weathersystem. New ideas are presented to explain both the mechanism by which planetaryalignments cause solar variations, and the reasons for detailed harmonicrelationships.”132 [4372.xhtml#3592] This is a bombshell, and will play a majorrole throughout this book, for observe what Tomes has just stated, and statedvery explicitly: planetary alignments constitute some sort of causal mechanismon the cycles of solar activity, and with that, we are but one step away fromastrology. There is but one problem with that conclusion, and that is that, withthe Foundation, one is dealing with a group that has massive amounts ofempirical, quantifiable, and regular cyclic data on which they may base theirtheoretical conclusions. And one need only compare this massive historicaldatabase, and the presence of at least one known member of the internationalbanking community, with Dr. David Li’s Gaussian copula formula whichdeliberately set aside historical data, to perceive the profound differencebetween the two approaches, and to perceive the implication that, at some point,someone “in the know” must have known what the real historical cycle would be.3. Finally, and for our immediate purpose, there is a paper by Mike Niemara whois stated simply to be an “Economist, Mitsubishi Bank, New York,” entitled“Forecasting Turning Points in the International Business Cycle.” While thetitle of this paper is what one might expect from an economist working for avery large Japanese international bank, the abstract, again, is not, for besidesreferring to the use of “new statistical techniques” for the “monitoring andforecasting of turning points in the international business cycle,” the abstractends in a most unconventional fashion by stating that the paper will also dealwith “the role of sunspots in economic activity”!133 [4372.xhtml#3594]From this one may reasonably conclude that at least some in the internationalbanking community have perceived a physics connection to macro-economic activityand cycles, and are bent on discovering what it is. One may envision this as akind of “econophysics,” for if there is a physics connection, then it stands toreason that if one has a “standard public consumption” physics view of physicalsystems as closed systems, then one will perforce have a similar view ofeconomics. But if, as these three examples of the Foundation’s published papersattest, both physics and economics are based on interrelated and hence opensystems, then one will have a corresponding economics and physics.134[4372.xhtml#3596]"},{"pageContent":"B. THE INEVITABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY OF CYCLES: CLOSED VS. OPEN SYSTEMSBut what did Dewey and Dakin themselves state about these cycles and theirimplications and significance?In the introduction to their book, Dewey and Dakin state their case with carefulcircumspection:There are those who, admitting that economics has not been an exact science,also insist that it cannot be, in the sense of predicting outcomes in humanaffairs. There are even some who consider prediction regarding human life as akind of impiety — or fakery, at best.…..The reader will be introduced to a method of thinking about the future which —new though it may be to him — seems definitely to have proved of value. It isthis method which is of fundamental importance — an importance greater than anyspecific conclusions to which it may lead. For on its validity depends the wholevalue of the conclusions.….It is hoped that the reader’s reward will be the discovery that in economics, asin other sciences, we are apparently dealing with laws regarding rhythmic humanresponse to certain stimuli that give a remarkable working tool to any man whois responsibly concerned with future outcomes — whether he be businessman,community leader, or statesman.135 [4372.xhtml#3598]Of course, the idea of a “remarkable working tool” in the hands of those“responsibly concerned with future outcomes” implies the same remarkable toolcould be used by those “irresponsibly concerned with future outcomes” as well.In short, behind their carefully measured prose lies the true significance oftheir work: it is an extraordinarily powerful tool of prediction, and, to thatextent, of manipulation.This they admit a little further on, when they hint at the potential physicsbasis of their work:The discovery that the law of averages applies to humanity — that certainactivities of people, viewed en masse, fall into definite patterns, some ofwhich repeat themselves with periodic rhythm — promises to be of great aid inmaking economics function as a true science.136 [4372.xhtml#3600]This appeal to a “statistical approach” to human behavior in the aggregatereveals the potential physics implications, for a similar such approach is usedin quantum mechanics, where the random motions and positions of individualparticles is never known, but a statistical picture can emerge of their behaviorin the aggregate. As will be seen, this analogy to physics only grows, andbecomes more explicit, as we proceed.137 [4372.xhtml#3602]But then, shortly after implying this “statistical physics” approach to sciencesof human behavior, Dewey and Dakin make a statement pregnant with implications:When a people finds that predictions of many financial advisers, statesmen,historians, and other proclaimed experts are seldom better than the predictionsof the astrologers, our social sciences have demonstrably not been earning theirway. It is time for action.138 [4372.xhtml#3604]Obviously, from the tenor of their remarks, Dewey and Dakin do not repose muchscientific basis or confidence in astrology. Yet, by appealing to it as anillustration of the state of the social sciences, including economics, they haveimplied a connection between the two. It is a connection that, as we shall see,only looms larger and larger as our examination of their book Cycles: TheScience of Prediction proceeds. Indeed, they can hardly have been oblivious tothe connection, and may have been trying to head off any criticism from certainquarters that they were indeed proposing a sophisticated kind of astrology.Having stated this peculiar comparison and caveat, they then proceed todistinguish between a “theoretical economics” and an “empirical economics,”again implying yet another analogy to physics:This book is an attempt to show, in an elementary way for the reader unfamiliarwith this form of research, how some of the inept arguments over economicoutlooks can be avoided by using a few facts that should now be familiar to all.This application of a new method to a study of economic activity, whilerelatively young, seems nevertheless more promising, in offering results, thantraditional economic theories that fill textbooks with opinions and argumentsover whether a given cause is really an effect, and vice versa.139[4372.xhtml#3606]In other words, one may imagine a “theoretical economist” filling blackboardswith complicated models and differential and integral equations, and on thatbasis, making analyses of “causes” and of “effects” with no real practicalutility or basis in data — Dr. Li comes to mind once again — or at best, a basisin a rather narrow selection of data. In fact, some data may fly completely inthe face of the proposed theoretical model. In this, the analogy to much ofmodern theoretical physics is very striking, where a certain class or type ofdata is ignored or swept under the rug because it is either contradictory to the“known” theory, or because the accepted and reigning theory is simply unable toaccount for it, and because there may not be — by such “theoretical physicists’”lights — any way to account for the data by any theory known to them. This, forDewey and Dakin, was exactly the state of modeling in standard economics intheir day. For them, they state their case with a classical “empiricalscientist’s” concision: “(The) ‘forecasts’ are written by the data…. They do notrest on the opinion of any man, or men. They are, in effect, the probabilitiesof tomorrow.”140 [4372.xhtml#3608]But what exactly did all this vast mountain of data — from cycles of atmosphericelectricity to tent caterpillar populations — indicate?A glance at a few of Dewey’s and Dakin’s charts of growth patterns in variousthings will say more than any words possibly could.[5700.jpeg]Graph of Spanish Trade141 [4372.xhtml#3610][5701.jpeg]Growth of White R at Population142 [4372.xhtml#3612][5702.jpeg]Graph of the Growth of Yeast Cells143 [4372.xhtml#3614][5703.jpeg]United States Population Growth144 [4372.xhtml#3616]Dewey and Dakin explain the meaning of these and similar graphs with simplicityand concision:The facts of growth are common knowledge to most mothers, who are encouraged bydoctors to keep a weight chart around the nursery, for reference at weighingtime. All healthy babies, like other healthy organisms, show large initial ratesof growth — over 100 per cent for babies the first year. As they get older, therate of growth gradually falls off. At the approach of maturity, the rate growthfinally reaches zero.Why it is that an organism stops growing we do not really know….But knowledge that such an inhibiting factor does exist is important to us, evenwhen we cannot explain it. We find it reasonable that such a factor should be atwork in organisms like a baby or a tree, just because we are used to observingit in action. But it also works in other kinds of organisms, such as humaninstitutions and business organizations.145 [4372.xhtml#3618]In other words, the pattern of growth, when appropriately graphed, is almostuniversal and identical, regardless of the time frame in which such growth ismeasured, whether that of mere minutes, days, or whole decades.And this necessitates a comment about Dr. Li’s copula formula, and indeed, aboutthe whole nature of privately-created debt money, versus the actual pattern ofeconomic growth. Under Li’s formula, and indeed, behind the whole principle ofmoney-as-debt creation, there lies one very obvious fact, namely, that there isno limit on the number of credit default swaps, or on the amount of debt, thatcan be created. Indeed, as the law of compound interest shows, such debt onlygrows exponentially, like a cancer. But as Dewey’s and Dakin’s endless examplesshow, actual growth within an economic system reaches a peak and begins to levelout, barring the introduction of new factors such as a new technology, into thesystem to open it up once again. Thus, under such considerations, the intereston debt, or even on debt swaps, can never be repaid.For example, when examining such cyclic graphs for industrial production invarious key industries in the United States, as well as for its overallpopulation growth and general economic trend, Dewey and Dakin came to what wasthen, in economically booming post-World War II America, a rather disturbing andradical conclusion:…(The) trends existing in a number of our great industries show definitely thatwe have been reaching a period of basic “maturity” in our whole economicdevelopment. This is a fact of enormous implications that reach in manydirections. The implications are so great, indeed, that many people (as usualwith humanity) find it easier to deny the fact, in heated argument, than face ithonestly and then proceed to deal with it.146 [4372.xhtml#3620]To put it succinctly, the United States was reaching the upper limit of growthin almost all crucial categories of activity. And, as their own graph of U.S.population growth that we have reproduced previously itself indicated, thislimit would begin to be reached around the years 2000 to 2100. It was a cyclereflected in other key areas."},{"pageContent":"1. Criticism from the ConventionalThe analogy between physics and economics in their theoretical and practicalpursuits highlights a series of criticisms conventionally-minded economists suchas Dr. Milton Friedman have leveled against Dewey’s and Dakin’s Cycles.According to Friedman, their bookis not a scientific book; the evidence underlying the stated conclusions is notpresented in full; data graphed are not identified so that someone else couldreproduce them; the techniques employed are nowhere described in detail…. Itsclosest analogue is the modern high-power advertisement — here of book lengthand designed to sell an esoteric and supposedly scientific product. Like mostmodern advertising, the book seeks to sell its product by making exaggeratedclaims for it… showing it in association with other valued objects which reallydon’t have anything to do with it… keeping discreetly silent about its defeatsor mentioning them in only the vaguest form… and citing authorities who thinkhighly of the product.147 [4372.xhtml#3622]But Friedman, too, later in life succumbed to the temptation to write a bookabout economic science for a popular audience called Free to Choose, one of thebooks influential in the popular culture of the Reagan era, and his own earliercriticisms against Dewey and Dakin might justifiably be leveled at his ownattempts at popularization in that book.More detailed criticisms came from economist Murray Rothbard, and with thesecriticisms, the analogy between physics and economics becomes even more acute:Any such “multicyclic” approach must be set down as a mystical adoption of thefallacy of conceptual realism. There is no reality or meaning to the allegedlyindependent sets of “cycles.” The market is one interdependent unit, and themore developed it is, the greater the interrelations among market elements. Itis therefore impossible for several or numerous independent cycles to coexist asself-contained units. It is precisely the characteristic of a business cyclethat it permeates all market activities.148 [4372.xhtml#3624]But Rothbard’s critique misses the mark, for nowhere do Dewey and Dakin claimthat their numerous cycles are “independent” of each other. All they claim isthat, whatever phenomenon as one chooses to examine that endures over time, thatphenomenon will demonstrate a cycle or wave pattern. They do not claim for thema self-contained independent closed system existence free from interrelationshipwith other such cycles. Indeed, as will be seen in the next section, they arguethe exact opposite of what Rothbard says they do.The physics analogy of Rothbard’s critique is thus evident, for by claiming thattheir multicyclic approach “must be set down as a mystical adoption of thefallacy of conceptual realism,” he is suggesting a kind of “Copenhagen” schoolof economics analogous to that in quantum mechanics, for whom the equations ofquantum mechanics did not refer to any underlying physical reality as theirbasis, but rather such equations were solely mathematical artifacts of thetheory.149 [4372.xhtml#3626] Similarly, for Rothbard, “there is no reality ormeaning to the allegedly independent cycles” because they are interrelated. ForDewey and Dakin, they are real precisely because they are open systems andinterrelated. The bottom line then is that Rothbard’s critique is an ideologicaland philosophical one. The problem, however, is that both Dewey and Dakin, andtheir critics, did not realize the true nature of what they had discovered,namely, that they had discovered something less about economics than aboutphysics, and that the economic activity their cycles were tracking were but asubset of a larger cyclic class of phenomena whose true nature andcharacteristics were the result of a very deep physical mechanics of thephysical medium itself. But that insight must wait for future chapters. We havealready seen, however, that Dewey and Dakin clearly must have suspected as much,since they included cyclic data about purely physical phenomena, and, as we havealso already seen, many members of the Foundation have presented papers linkingthe two in a kind of “econophysics,” suggesting a purely physics-based influenceon the patterns of cyclic human activity. This was a conception that, onceagain, recalls astrology, and Dewey’s and Dakin’s own remarks about economicsand astrology. Such remarks suggest that they may have begun to suspect somedeep and profound relationship between their economic cycles and very ancientconceptions of physical influences upon mankind epitomized by that ancientcraft."},{"pageContent":"C. Cycles, Trends, and Cycles Upon CyclesSo exactly how do Dewey and Dakin demonstrate their awareness that all the vastnumber of cycles their Foundation has tracked are indeed interdependent? Theanswer to this question lies (1) in their distinction between cycles and trends,(2) in their conception of a periodic cycle, and (3) in what they call“overlays” of cycles. With these “overlays,” as we shall see, there is an exactphysics analogue, and in that analogue, profound implications."},{"pageContent":"1. The Period PatternsCycles may easily be distinguished from mere trends within an overall periodicrhythm by a glance at one of their many graphs. Note on the following graph howthe basic waveform of the cyclic period is graphed, versus the actual measureddata, some of which falls above, and some of which falls below, the theoreticalvalue of the wave form itself. Those smaller peaks and troughs within theoverall pattern they designate as “trends,” as distinct from the overallperiodic cycle itself. If one examines the chart carefully, it is evident thatthe psychological effects of a “trend” will vary depending on where in a cycleit occurs. For example: if a downward trend occurs on the upward curve of acycle, the effect will not be as severe. If it occurs on a downward portion of acycle, it will be felt as correspondingly more severe.150 [4372.xhtml#3628][5704.jpeg]54-Year Periodic Cycle of Wholesale Prices151 [4372.xhtml#3630]As we shall discover, this distinction between a mere trend and an overall cyclewill have profound implications in their understanding of how much, or little,human actions, including political action, can exacerbate or alleviate anoverall cycle.Their remarks in this respect are illuminating:We shall quickly discover that the so-called business or economic cycle is inreality a composite of many different cycles. We shall be particularlyinterested in studying them for evidences of rhythm. For if and when we findrhythm we can, to the extent justifiable, predict recurrence; and we shall havepredictability on the basis of much more than finite logic and guess.It has long been assumed that if we could only isolate the causes of economiccycles we could then effectually prevent them, and so eliminate the downsweepsthat plague highly organized societies.Many volumes have been written to discuss the cases. Here we shall be far lessconcerned with the cause than with the timing.152 [4372.xhtml#3632]Note that Dewey and Dakin explicitly state that the “economic cycle is inreality a composite of many different cycles,” and thus expose the criticism ofMurray Rothbard previously cited — that they do not take into consideration thecomplexity of the interrelationships of components of an economy — as utterlyunrelated to anything Dewey or Dakin actually wrote! Their real “heresy,” as weshall see, lies not in the interrelationship of economic cycles, but inproposing that there may be even deeper relationships between economic cyclesand cycles of purely physical phenomena.In any case, it is worth noting what they state about rhythms or rhythmic cyclesand periods:Rhythm, or rhythmic cycle, will ordinarily be used to denote a cycle whichrepeats itself at rather uniform time intervals. Rhythm implies a kind of beat.Thus the beating of the heart is rhythmic, though it may be slightly irregular.Perdiocity, periodic cycle, or regular cycle, will be used to denote a cyclewhich repeats itself at mathematically exact intervals. True periodicity, like atrue straight line or a true circle, does not exist in nature; but we have closeapproximations.153 [4372.xhtml#3634]Here is yet another link, and a potential clue, to the deeper physics that maybe involved in such interrelationships, for such cycles are preciselyquantizable, and these quantities, these measurable cycles, may be giving outprofound clues about the nature and structure of space-time itself. Dewey andDakin were not oblivious to this physics connection and implication, but on thecontrary, carefully selected a specific physics analogue to explain theirconception of deeply interrelated economic (and other) cycles. To see what thisphysics analogue is, one must examine what they mean by interrelated cycles."},{"pageContent":"2. “Overlays”: Combined Cycles as Multiwave Modulation, and Possibly asInterferometry?Briefly put, interrelated cycles are really nothing but super-positions of thewave form of one cycle upon that of one or more others. For example, among themany quantifiable types of cycles operative in various realms of activity —whether human or otherwise — Dewey and Dakin devote a significant portion oftheir book to the overview of a nine-year cycle,154 [4372.xhtml#3636] a nine andtwo-thirds year cycle,155 [4372.xhtml#3638] a four-year cycle,156[4372.xhtml#3640] a 41-month solar cycle and other types of solar cycles,157[4372.xhtml#3642] a 35-year weather cycle,158 [4372.xhtml#3644] a 22-yearweather-solar cycle,159 [4372.xhtml#3646] and of course the 54-year cycle whosegraph we have previously cited.160 [4372.xhtml#3648]As indicated, Dewey and Dakin, no less than their more conventionally-mindedeconomist critics, view economic cycles as a complex system ofinterrelationships, but unlike their critics, do not despair of quantifyingthose relationships, not in terms of their causes and effects but in terms oftheir beginning and periodicity in time. Thus, the interrelationship of allthese cycles expresses itself in an exact model: that of the superposition ofthe wave forms of the cycles themselves, or what they call “overlays.”[5705.jpeg]Dewey and Dakin’s Example of the Overlay of the Nine-Year and 54-Year Cycles161[4372.xhtml#3650]At the top of this graph is a simplified version of the nine-year cycle. In themiddle is the 54-year cycle, and at the bottom is the “overlay” or composite ofboth cycles. It should be noted that the longer and lower-frequency 54-yearcycle retains a “dominant characteristic” in the composite over its shorter andhigher-frequency nine-year cycle. This too, as we shall discover, is yet anotherimportant clue to a possible deeper underlying physics.According to Dewey and Dakin, one of the first to notice the possibility of aconnection between economic activity and physics was Sir William H. Beveridge,whoFound several true periods that gave strong evidence of correlation with knownweather rhythms and sunspot phenomena. And a T= 54.00 years (which is withoutsuch a correlation) he also found a relatively significant concentration ofenergy.162 [4372.xhtml#3652]Of course, this much was, in a certain sense, obvious, for solar activity doesaffect terrestrial weather, and terrestrial weather can in turn affectagricultural production, which in turn can affect overall economic activity.There does not seem to be much here by way of a deeper physics.But it was when certain cycles — particularly the nine-, nine and two-thirds,and 54-year cycles — were overlaid that one began to notice something verysignificant:As Schumpeter has said:“It is clear that the coincidence at any time of corresponding phrases of allthree cycles will always produce phenomena of unusual intensity, especially ifthe phases that coincide are those of prosperity or depression. The threedeepest and longest “depressions” within the epoch covered by our material —1925-1930, 1973-1878, and 1929-1934 — all display that characteristic.163[4372.xhtml#3654]As will eventually be seen, the overlay of these cycles and their concurrence atperiods of various “great depressions” in American economic history do indeedpoint to a deeper physics, but one in which, however, the astrologicalconnection is even more in evidence.Needless to say, however, this approach of “overlays” or superpositions ofvarious economic and business cycles — not to mention their combinations withother cyclic rhythms having at first glance nothing to do with economics —throws the normal “cause and effect” analysis of conventional economic thinkingand theory into a cocked hat.Most of us, taught to think in conventional terms of cause and effect, andtrained in a system where the educational wares are often cut to the lowestcommon denominator of mass intelligence, find it hard to remember that the humanmind is very finite. It can never hope to grasp in any situation all the causesthat may work together to produce any given result. That is why judgments are sofaulty when we reason solely on the ordinary cause-and-effect basis. Some if notmost of the actual causes will escape our knowledge, and those we do take intocalculation may be pure assumption. If despite this we reach a correctconclusion, it is a triumph of accident — or of intuition.164 [4372.xhtml#3656]For Dewey and Dakin, the fallacy of such cause-effect thinking in economiccycles is aptly illustrated by the similarity of cyclic activity in real estatecycles and marriages within the United States. This similarityCould readily lead to some false assumptions. It would be simple enough toreason that people who get married start to think about house-hunting andhome-building, and that this results in building projects. Or one could starthis reasoning in reverse, and end in the same place, by saying that buildingstimulates prosperity, and when people feel prosperous they get married, andwhen married they buy the homes that contractors have previously erected toattract customers who feel prosperous because money is being spent to erectbuildings for people who will get married.Such reason-why arguments chase their tails. Nor is this statement of themunusual, except in brevity. Whole books have been written that incorporate such“reasoning” into learned syllables. We should be prepared to ignore reasoning ofthat kind, but we are justified in asking why our building statistics shouldformulate themselves in such exceedingly regular rhythms. Before research of thefuture supplied us with a definitive answer to this particular query, we mayhazard a postulate that man’s mating instinct and man’s building instinct may beaboriginally associated in his being, just as they extend down the biologicalscale to the birds. If both instincts proved to flow in the race in a commonrhythm, it should not seem too surprising. Perhaps economists could well joinforces with biologists in the new kind of research such a problem suggests.165[4372.xhtml#3658]Note then, that far from viewing each cycle in their “overlays” as independentrealities as their critics such as Rothbard would suggest, not only do Dewey andDakin view the entirety of economic activity as a complex overlay of suchcycles, but they level almost the same criticism at their detractors, in that byfocusing too narrowly on purely “economic” activity and cycles, their criticsmay in fact be ignoring cyclic clues from other disciplines that may affordgenuine insight as to the real natures of their causes.Thus, they call for an interdisciplinary approach. They also observe that, ascomparison between disparate and discrete disciplines grows, so too does thesuspicion that the discrete phenomena are related in some deep fashion, thatthey are all clues to a deep connection in the physics of all observed cycles,no matter what their subject matter:In the various categories of rhythms we know, some are as familiar to the man inthe street as day and night and the tides; others are relatively unknown to him.Analytical work on these rhythms has been developing in what might be called theinterstices of the sciences. We have as yet only the beginnings of a science ofrhythms per se. But in each field of science some group of workers becomesespecially concerned with the subject of rhythms in the special field ofphenomena he is observing; such a group eventually compares notes with acorresponding group engaged in some other scientific field; and slowly allconcerned begin to suspect that they are dealing, however diverse the fields,with phenomena somehow related.166 [4372.xhtml#3660]As is by now apparent, Dewey and his Foundation for the Study of Cycles had longsince suspected such deep connections between disparate and discrete cycles, forit was founded precisely as a means of coordinating data from all fields ofinquiry in an interdisciplinary fashion."},{"pageContent":"3. Inevitability, Predictability, and Human ActionsThere is another implication to Dewey’s and Dakin’s analysis, and indeed, to thework of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles as a whole. It is an implicationalready encountered, but it is best to restate it here: if cycles — particularlyeconomic cycles — are of regular and quantifiable periodicity, then this impliesthat they are inevitable, and because inevitable, predictable. This in turnwould seem to limit the scope of human action and its ability to influence suchcycles merely to affecting trends, rather than the cycles themselves. Indeed,citing Schumpeter’s Business Cycles once again, they note that when one studiesthe various economic policies of England, the United States, and Nazi Germany inresponse to the Great Depression, they noted that of all the various measureseach country took, including Hjalmar Schacht’s subsidized exports and varioussystems of marks in Germany,167 [4372.xhtml#3662] to Roosevelt’s New Dealprograms in the U.S.A., the rises in prosperity in each country nevertheless“arrived strictly as might have been anticipated by anyone projecting thefamiliar economic waves of the past.”168 [4372.xhtml#3664] In other words,whatever the trends the respective governmental policies in each nation mighthave induced, the overall cycle itself was destined to turn precisely when itdid, regardless of governmental policy or political action. Financial policycould amplify or damp the overall trend within a cycle, but could never arrestor reverse the cycle itself. And the reason is again clear: the cycle itself wasevidence of a deep physics being played out on the stage of aggregate humanactivity.Indeed, such policies or actions oftentimes function merely as devices ofconcealment, cloaking the reality of the inevitability of such cycles byappearing to manipulate the cycle itself by measures that, in fact, manipulateonly the trend:Devices like the Bretton Woods Economic agreement, or Treasury grants made aspolitical “loans” to foreign nations, may tend for temporary periods to maskthis truism — much as the working of the Federal Reserve Act tends to concealfrom the general public the fact that we print dollars to meet governmentdeficits. But our chart says forthrightly, in statistical language, that on thebasis of the long-established trend, and in terms of foreign trade handled at areal profit, we should not be too optimistic in looking for such trade to beincreased over the prewar volume…. All our chart can tell us is that, failing arevolution of some sort, the pattern as established will presumably prevail.169[4372.xhtml#3666]Note then that, so long as prevailing conditions remain, the cycle itself isbasically unaffected. It is when the system again becomes an open system, whenchanges of a radical nature, such as a technological revolution, occur, that thecycle itself can be directly affected."},{"pageContent":"4. Waves, Wars, and RevolutionsBut barring this, humans inherently tend to resist the notion that economiccycles and waves may be beyond the ability of man to control. “They accept theneed of adjustment to the weather, knowing it is out of man’s control. But theyresist passionately any suggestion that changes in the social and economicclimate may be beyond the total rule of man’s conscious will.”170[4372.xhtml#3668] The only way that mankind could in effect change theinevitability of a given cycle of economic activity is precisely to introducerevolutionary change:We now know enough about trend lines to realize that old ones merge into thetake-off of new ones only when fundamental, even revolutionary, changes haveoccurred in the environment and its organization, and perpetuate themselves….Remember Pearl’s (fruit fly) bottle. Imagine for a moment that we Americans arethe (fruit flies). We are reaching the upper asymptote of our (populationgrowth) curve. The invention of a few new gadgets by industry — indeed, theinvention of a whole new industry itself — is a force in no way adequate tochange the relationships in our bottle. We must have a whole new bottle.171[4372.xhtml#3670]In other words, we now find the economic inevitability behind the strategyoutlined in chapter one; the global elite, in order to maintain any sort of“sustainable growth” — to use one of their favorite catch phrases — must eitherexpand humanity’s “bottle” into outer space in a significant way, or perpetuateregional imbalances and conflicts and wars and the economic growth for some thatthis inevitably brings, or they must admit the growth of a revolutionarytechnology which completely changes the nature of the relationships inside thebottle itself. Failing this, they must export and then re-import manufacturingand technology from one region to another, and lower population, in anever-ending shell game, if the bottle-expanders of outer space and radicallynew technologies are not pursued. In short, the only real way to alter theinevitability of a cycle is to make the bottle an open system, and any opensystem invariably challenges the very basis of their power, unless, of course,the pursuit of revolutionary technology is one they can monopolize and employ tosecure their hegemony."},{"pageContent":"5. Waves, Overlays, and Modulation: The Physics Analogues Employed by Dewey andDakin, and Their ImplicationsDewey and Dakin do much more than just imply a physics connection with all theirallusions to closed and open systems, and to deep connections between economicactivity and solar cycles and overlays of cycles. They also draw very explicitanalogies to physics. We have noted that they draw upon cycles of various length— nine, four, 35, and 54 years to name but a few — but they are open to evenmore possibilities:Now, let us suppose that there are still longer waves in the universe — “Y”waves we may call them. Imagine some of the waves with peaks which come 3 ½years apart, others with peaks 9 years apart, 18 ½ years apart, 54 years apart,and perhaps much farther spaced. It is not inconceivable that these longer wavescould directly or indirectly affect the sun, weather, animals, and human beings,and that just as a red pencil may respond to light waves of only one length, soa particular organism might respond only to Y waves of one particular length.172[4372.xhtml#3672]They are, in other words, proposing a kind of “econo-bio-physics,” whereparticular kinds of organisms are transducers, are coupled harmonic oscillators,of waves of cycles of particular wavelengths, much like pipes in a pipe organrespond to different wavelengths and harmonics.Invoking the analogy of sound, in fact, is not reading too much into theirremarks, for they in fact do so by pointing out that the exact physical analogueof their “overlays” of cycles is that of sound waves being modulated together.[5706.jpeg]Overlay of Two Sound Waves173 [4372.xhtml#3674]Again, as with their overlay of the 54- and nine-year cycles, note that theoverall characteristic of the lower-frequency, longer-wavelength wave ispreserved even with the grafting of the shorter higher frequency sound wave onto it. This process is called modulation, and in this instance, the longer lowerfrequency wave has become a carrier wave. They extend the wave modulationanalogy even further, by pointing our that any wave of a particular wavelengthand shape will have an overtone, or harmonic series,174 [4372.xhtml#3676] whichare composed of fractions of that wavelength: one-half, one-third, one-fourth,one-fifth, and so on. They give the following chart of the graph of a sound wavefrom an organ pipe, and its first 12 overtones, or harmonics:[5707.jpeg]Harmonic Series of an Organ Pipe175 [4372.xhtml#3678]Dewey and Dakin are strongly suggesting, then, that there may be a deeperphysics of a wave mechanics involved in the overlay of economic cycles, and thatcorrelations of sunspot activity with, for example, economic cycles of wholesaleprices, may have a much deeper basis than merely the influence of the sun uponthe weather, and of the weather on agricultural production and prices. In otherwords, they may both be immediate and manifest results of an underlying and moreunified phenomenon.But they go much further than even this, and in doing so, not only demonstratethat they are thinking in terms of a very deep, and indeed hyper-dimensional,physics, but also reveal some profound implications and questions that willpreoccupy us throughout the remainder of this book. It is best to cite them atlength in order to understand the full implications and significance of the deepphysics connection that they are suggesting, and of its profound implications:To that end let us consider in terms of modern psychology and physics a fewfacts important for our approach to economic science.P.D. Ouspensky once asked his readers to make an experiment. Imagine, he said,that you live in two dimensions, instead of three. An easy way to do this is toimagine you are a being like a piece of paper, infinitely thin, living upon atable. You can look neither up nor down, for up and down are in a thirddimension. You cannot even think up and down, or conceive it. For you have nothickness, and hence cannot even imagine thickness.Now in the center of this tabletop where you live, there is cut a slot. In thisslot there revolves a wheel, so hung that half the wheel is always below thetable, and half of it above. This wheel is solid and you can see only the edgeof it. Let us imagine its edge is painted in four colored segments — black,white, blue, and red. As the wheel revolves, you observe it end-on, you ofcourse do not know that it is a wheel you see. For you are a two-dimensionalbeing, and therefore see only a single line of color along the tabletop.Occasionally, as the wheel slowly revolves, you do see that line change suddenlyin color. Red will suddenly change to black, and black to white, white to blue,and blue to red again.Now, if you observe this phenomenon long enough, you will finally decide thatwhen the red comes up, it will eventually cause black; and when the blackappears, it will eventually cause blue. You will think you know the causes ofthe phenomena you observe.If a two-dimensional scientist is observing the phenomena, he will eventuallydiscover a “law” in this continuity of event. Using this law, he will be able topredict changes of color accurately. The scientist, by the use of mathematics,might also discover that a third dimension was necessary to account for the realphenomenon he saw in two dimensions only. But neither of you could imagine thisthird dimension as a sensory reality. Nor could you know the real nature of thecauses operating there. The scientist would admit this frankly, saying his lawmerely described what happened, without explaining it. But you, untrained insuch fine distinctions, would speak boldly of a “cause” being followed by an“effect.” And each “effect” would in turn become a new cause (in your way ofthinking) resulting in a further effect which followed. If you persisted in thisbelief, you might eventually resent being told that you knew nothing about thereal causality.176 [4372.xhtml#3680]Clearly, Dewey and Dakin are suggesting that what we call cause and effect arereally but artifacts of our “three-dimensionally-conditioned consciousness”grappling with phenomena that have their origins in a hyper-dimensional world ofmore than three dimensions.One might therefore add to their analogy of a “hyper-dimensional” worldevidencing itself in cycles that our scientist might, by dint of the same sortof mathematical techniques, deduce a very different object — the “wheel” — asthe real cause and effect of that which we perceive as a cycle. And this bringsthem to a vital fact:What we call our recognition of “cause” and “effect” is somehow associated withtime, and with our perception in time. This is important to understand, for whatwe call time is apparently only a mode of perception…. Ouspensky, approachingthe problem from a psychological background, goes so far as to suggest that timeis the way we experience space in its higher dimensions. That is, the unknowndimensions of space are revealed to us in time.177 [4372.xhtml#3682]In other words, not only are Dewey and Dakin suggesting that the sought-afterdeeper physics underlying their “harmonic overlays” and modulations of cyclesmight lie in a hyper-dimensional physics, but they are also suggesting thatcause/effect thinking such as in the case of the sunspot-wholesale pricesoverlay cycle is in fact erroneous. It is not solar activity as the ultimatecase, with weather modification as the mediate cause, and wholesale agriculturalprice changes as the final effect, but rather, the solar cycle, the fluctuationof weather, the fluctuation of prices might all be the immediate, thoughadmittedly interrelated, three-dimensional effects of a hyper-dimensional cause.In such a model, our perceptions of them as “weather” and “solar activity” andeven “price fluctuations” and so on, are similar to our perceptions of a beam oflight that is split by a prism into its spectral components. In such a model,our three-dimensional reality is the prism refracting the several wave formsinto its various constituents that we perceive as separate cycles. Moreover,Ouspensky, whom they cite, is quite clearly suggesting that time itself is not adimensionless “scalar” entity, but rather an entity of multi-dimensional spaceswhich three-dimensional reality experiences as a temporal flow. Thus, theiranalogy of the modulation of waves upon a carrier wave, and of multipleharmonics of that wave, as in the pipe organ example, is meant to couple thenotion of hyper-dimensionality to those harmonics of waves. This, as we shallsee in the next chapter, is a profound clue."},{"pageContent":"D. CONCLUSIONS, IMPLICATIONS, AND A SEGUE IN THE FORM OF SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONSSo what may be reasonably concluded about this cursory overview of the cyclesresearch of Edward Dewey and his Foundation for the Study of Cycles? We shallitemize the points covered in this chapter in order to make explicit the fullramifications of their research:1. The discovery of cycles of the same periodicity (or, to employ their ownphysics analogy, wavelength) in so many areas of cyclic activity with noapparent connection to each other, such as wholesale prices and sunspotactivity, implies a deep connection between physics and economics; it implies akind of “econophysics”;2. The regularity of such cycles implied not only their inevitability but alsotheir quantifiability and predictability;3. This in turn implied that governmental policies could only exacerbate oralleviate the overall trend of a cycle, but never reverse or arrest it, so longas the cycle remained a closed system without revolutionary expansion of thesystem itself, or introduction of radical new “Bottle-expanding” technologies.For this reason, the underlying implied “econophysics” necessitates that theglobal elite has only three strategies open to it in the eventuality ofachieving their goal of a global corporate state:a. Regionalized imbalances and controlled wars and conflict in perpetuity, andvarious forms and degrees of population reduction, so long as the system remainsclosed in its “bottle”;b. an opening of the system by expansion of its environment, which practicallycan only mean a large human presence in outer space;c. an opening of the system by a radical change in technology, a necessity ifthere is to be a large human presence in deep space.178 [4372.xhtml#3684]The last two alternatives pose some risk should the elite choose to follow them,for they inevitably carry with them the risk that their own power base can beinevitably challenged from a superior position, or superior technology, or both.Similarly, the first strategy carries the risk that their ability to control andmanage such conflict would spiral out of their control.4. The type of hyper-dimensional physics that their own words imply indicates adeep connection betweena. the harmonics of multiple-wave modulation or combination,b. time,c. cause, andd. effect.179 [4372.xhtml#3686]5. This implies the most profound implication of them all: if that physics weresufficiently known and a technology could be devised to tap into it, thatselfsame physics would imply a technology to tap into, modify, and control humanbehavior itself, inclusively of the ability to manipulate aggregate economicbehavior.180 [4372.xhtml#3688] One could, with a sufficient basis in thisphysics, directly manipulate whole economies and populations.6. Not surprisingly, then, it was discovered that a large corporation and bankwas represented in the Foundation for the Study of Cycles’ membership,181[4372.xhtml#3690] and individual bankers appear to have utilized some sort ofknowledge of such cycles to time their entrance into various markets, or theexpansion of their financial empires.182 [4372.xhtml#3692]With all these conclusions and implications in mind, including especially theirown suggestive analogy to the combination of several waves into one, then aprofound question occurs: given the truthfulness of the analogy for the sake ofargument, then what is the carrier wave for all these combined waves of cycles?What is the underlying reality, or the deeper physics, that they are suggesting?And for that matter, why does a certain class of the super-wealthy seem to knowsomething about this “econophysics” that the rest of the business and economicworld do not? And beyond the fact that some of that class might not know all ofit, then why are so many of them apparently involved in the study of it?The answers to these questions, surprisingly, lie in the mists, sands, texts,pavilions and columns of ancient history and temples, and a well-known and veryancient “pseudo-science”: astrology."},{"pageContent":"ThreeGERMANY, RCA, AND J.P. MORGANCASES OF INTEREST AND SUPPRESSION[5708.jpeg]“The secret at the core of alchemy is an ineffable experience of the realworkings of our local cosmological neighborhood.”— Jay Weidner and Vincent Bridges183 [4372.xhtml#3694]Dewey’s and Dakin’s sound wave analogy for their cyclic waves of economicactivity raises the profound question: is there a physics basis to economiccycles? And if so, what is it? Moreover, if their own sound wave analogy isitself more apt than Dewey and Dakin themselves suspected, then what carrierwave modulates all these cycles of waves? As was seen in the previous chapter,the analogy of sound waves and carrier waves was no doubt suggested to Dewey andDakin by the fact that such waves could be plotted together, or “averaged.”"},{"pageContent":"A. DR. HARTMUT MÜLLER AND GLOBAL SCALING THEORYBut they were not the only ones to notice that waves of cycles of activity mightpoint to a deeper physics connection. German physicist Dr. Hartmut Müller hadconsidered a similar phenomenon from yet a different point of view, and proposeda theory to account for it: Global Scaling Theory.Müller begins by noting that the theory is based upon what, for physics, is itsprimary “sacrament”: measurement. But the centrality of measurement in themethodology of physics soon reduced the physicist to playing the role of a kindof “court of arbitration” because his role is now that of deciding “which of themodels” adopted by physicists to explain reality “matches the measurements andgets applied.”184 [4372.xhtml#3696] This assessment highlights the cul-de-sac inwhich physics deadlocked in the twentieth century, for there is no singletestable theory valid over the scales or sizes of objects with which physicsmust deal, for the laws of standard physics operable at the scale of the verylarge, laws dominated by Einstein’s relativity theories since the earlytwentieth century, are not applicable to the scale of the very small at thelevel of atoms and subatomic particles, where the laws of quantum mechanicsprevail.In this situation, physics and physicists are reduced, according to Dr. Müller,to being “mere interpreter(s) of models and ideas that got completely out oftouch with reality — and this to an ever greater extent.”185 [4372.xhtml#3698]In short, like many other physicists, Dr. Müller is increasingly dissatisfiedwith the counterintuitive nature of contemporary physical mechanics, whether itbe the relativity-dominated theories of the physics of large-scale systems orthe quantum mechanical theories of the very small, with their emphasis onstatistical probabilistic approaches.186 [4372.xhtml#3700]But there was one area in which the concentration on “the sacrament ofmeasurement” did lead to something of major — if unappreciated — significance,and in this one discerns a direct conceptual connection to the work of Dewey andDakin:The need for measurements of the highest precision promoted the development ofmathematical statistics which, in turn, made it possible to include precisemorphological and sociological data as well as data from evolutionary biology.Ranging from elementary particles to galactic clusters, this scientific databaseextends at least 55 orders of magnitude.187 [4372.xhtml#3702]In other words, a vast database of measurements of all types and kinds ofobjects now existed, extending over the entire range of objects with whichphysics had to deal, from subatomic particles to planets, stars, and finally towhole galaxies and clusters of galaxies. With such a vast database ofmeasurements at their disposal, one would think that scientists would have begunto contemplate its significance almost as soon as it had been available, namelyin the early decades of the twentieth century.Yet, notes Müller, this extensive database “did not become the object of anintegrated (holistic) scientific investigation until 1982. The treasure lying attheir feet was not seen by members of the labour-divided, mega-industrialscientific community.”188 [4372.xhtml#3704] Given the disenchantment ofwell-known and famous Russian physicists like Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev with thestandard models of relativistic and quantum mechanical theories, it is notsurprising that Russian scientists were the first to make a significantbreakthrough and contribution toward the rise of Global Scaling Theory, for thefirst to draw attention to this database and its potential significance was aRussian biologist named Cislenko.Publishing a scientific paper in Moscow in 1980 entitled “Structure of Flora andFauna with Regard to Body Size of Organisms,” Cislenko proved that “segments ofincreased species representation are repeated on the logarithmic line of bodysizes in equal intervals (approximately 0.5 units of the decadic logarithm).”189[4372.xhtml#3706] In other words, Cislenko had discovered something very similarto Dewey’s and Dakin’s cycles of economic activity: regular, periodic “wavelike”forms in the relative grouping of organic life’s body sizes around certainvalues or measures of size. There was just one problem: this grouping or“clumping” around certain scales of size “was not explicable from a biologicalpoint of view.” For example, what mechanism could account for organismspreferring body sizes of “8-12 centimetres, 33-55 centimetres or 1.5-2.4 meters”and so on?190 [4372.xhtml#3708]For Hartmut Müller, however, the biological clumping around certain values in aperiodic logarithmic scale pointed clearly to a deeper underlying physics basisfor the phenomenon, for there were similar scale-invariant (i.e., applicableacross all scales or measures of size) logarithmic distributions evident in thedatabase of physics. Thus, by 1982, Müller was able to proveThat there exist statistically identical frequency distributions withlogarithmic, periodically recurrent maximums for the masses of atoms and atomicradii as well as the rest masses and life-spans of the elementary particles.”191[4372.xhtml#3710]Shades of Dewey and Dakin! But that was not all, for very similar patterns weresubsequently found for the logarithmic line of the “sizes, orbits, masses andrevolution periods of planets, moons, and asteroids.”192 [4372.xhtml#3712] Thephenomenon was scale-invariant, and, when graphed, revealed clear periodic“cyclic” types of “waves.”In other words, Dr. Müller was chin to chin with the same type of phenomena asthose which confronted Dewey and Dakin, only in this instance the phenomena werepurely based on measurement of physical objects — particles and planets — andnot economic cycles. Yet the wave forms resulting from them were almost thesame. In fact, in a certain sense, they were identical simply because they werewaves!This now puts Dewey’s and Dakin’s “sound wave analogy” and the question it posesin a whole new light, for it would now appear that we are no longer dealing withmerely a conceptual analogy, but an analogy with actual correspondence in thereal physical world. So the attendant question of that analogy — i.e., what isthe carrier wave for all these diverse cycles? — also emerges into a whole newand vitally important context, and it is one Dr. Müller answers very directly,although he was probably unaware that he was also responding to a question posedby two American economists as a result of their own accumulation of a vastdatabase of measurements."},{"pageContent":"1. Longitudinal Waves in the Physical MediumDr. Müller is a mathematical physicist, and as such was quick to perceive therelationship, since all the discrete measurements had a single unifying andunderlying structure. That structure was simply that of a recurrent logarithmicperiod, i.e., a wave, or better, a harmonic series. It is when one considers thecause of this structure that the questions and implications begin to becomeevident and to multiply. As Dr. Müller states the case, the cause of thisstructure appeared to be “the existence of a standing pressure wave in thelogarithmic space of the scales/measures” used to measure the phenomenathemselves.193 [4372.xhtml#3714] To put this point differently, I cite directlymy comments about this observation from my The Giza Death Star Destroyed:…(T)he phenomenon of measurement itself, both as a phenomenon of intelligentobservation and as a physical function, is scale-invariant, because regardlessof the selected unit of measurement, the result still and always possesses alogarithm, a longitudinal standing wave structure.194 [4372.xhtml#3716]Note carefully, however, what Dr. Müller has actually said, and what he has notsaid. He has said that the phenomenon exists in a kind of “conceptual space.” Hehas not said that the phenomenon exists as a structure in the physical mediumitself, although it is clear that he is only a small step away from actuallystating that. But as we shall now discover, he himself is inclined to the viewthat the phenomenon is physical in nature, and derives from a quantized view ofthe medium itself as a structured set of longitudinal “pressure” waves in thatmedium.195 [4372.xhtml#3718]As I have stated elsewhere,The results of this supposition were astounding, for regardless of the naturalsystem studied, there were areas of “attraction,” where any number of verydiscrete natural phenomena clustered, and “repulsion,” areas avoided by naturalsystems. So pervasive was this phenomenon that the German Institute fürRaum-Energie-Foeschung (Institute for Space Energy Research) “was also able toprove the same phenomenon in demographics,” i.e., in areas favored or shunned byurban populations, and in the economics both of nations and privatebusinesses.196 [4372.xhtml#3720]Note what is really going on here:1. Müller’s standing longitudinal waves in logarithmic space are applicable notonly to physical phenomena, but to the same areas of activity as studied byDewey and Dakin; thus,2. Müller’s Global Scaling Theory conclusively indicates that there is indeed adeeper physics to economic activity, to the very cycles of boom and bust ascatalogued by Dewey’s and Dakin’s Foundation for the Study of Cycles; andfinally,3. Note that the German Institute for Space Energy Research is sponsoringresearch not only into this deeper physics, but doing so precisely in relationto a study of the physics of economic and human activity and socialorganization. It is important for the reader to understand at this juncture thatthe term “Space Energy” in the German has the same sort of technical meaning orimplication as the terms “vacuum” or “zero-point” energy has in English. Inshort, a German institution recognizes, funds, and researches not onlyZero-Point energy, but researches it in the full range of its implications,including social and demographic, presumably for the purpose of engineering allof them to the extent possible.But let us return for a few more insights from Müller’s theory, for there is yetanother significant implication that his theory holds.That implication is gravity, for Müller’s standing pressure wave in the mediummay indeed be an explanation for the phenomenon of gravity. Simply put, the factthat natural systems “cluster” around the nodal points of these standing waveswould indeed be a component or mechanism for the explanation of gravity inMüller’s opinion.197 [4372.xhtml#3722] It is important to understand the basicdifference of this explanation from that of Einstein’s General Relativity interms of the order of concepts. For the latter, gravity is simply the curving ofspace-time that results from the presence of a large mass in local space-time.But Müller’s theory is a much less superficial, and much deeper, theory, forboth the warping of space-time and the large mass of a star or planet are boththemselves the results of a much deeper structure around which both “cluster,”and that structure is the structure of longitudinal pressure waves ofcompression and rarefaction in the physical medium itself. In a sense, the warpor curving of space-time is more fundamental than in Einstein’s theory, for in acertain simplistic way of stating it, the warp results not from the presence ofa large mass, but rather the converse: the large mass is present because of theunderlying warp in the medium and the clustering of such waves around certainnodal points, almost the exact opposite of Einstein’s theory.This already gives one an appreciation of the significance of Global ScalingTheory, for in a certain sense, Einstein’s theory is not engineerable, for ifone wished to warp space-time within the constraints of General Relativity, alarge mass such as a star or planet would have to be present to do so. But theconverse is true of Global Scaling theory, for one would not need the presenceof a large mass to warp space-time, since that warped structure itself is alongitudinal pressure wave in the physical medium. One could, by warpingspace-time, create a “virtual mass” or, conversely, an “antigravity hill.”For Dr. Müller, there are two immediate practical applications of this theory.In the first instance, the theory of standing longitudinal waves in the mediumopens the possibility of using such waves and modulating them — for they areindeed the mysterious “carrier waves” suggested by Dewey’s and Dakin’s sonicwave analogy — with information for communications purposes. Such waves would bemuch faster than ordinary light waves, since objects separated from each otherover great distances in normal space can be quite close in the logarithmic spacein which these waves move. Secondly, such a modulated “gravity wave” could bedemodulated at any location on the Earth, Mars, or even outside the solarsystem, “at the very same moment in time.”198 [4372.xhtml#3724] The reason issimple enough. Large masses are natural resonators of such waves.199[4372.xhtml#3726] And again, the reason is clear, for they tend to clusteraround the nodal points or places where such waves interfere, that is, wherethey intersect. Thus, the building of expensive satellites of space-basedcommunications systems would not only be unnecessary, but in a certain sense,since such satellites are of much less comparative mass than a planet, theywould not be cost-effective, since they would be very inefficient as coupledoscillators or receivers of such waves, as compared to a planet with its largemass itself."},{"pageContent":"2. The Link: GeometriesIf there is a relationship between such longitudinal waves in the medium andgravity, it follows that as relationships of planetary alignments — theday-to-day, month-to-month, and year-to-year geometries of alignments ofcelestial bodies — will evidence similar relationships to human activity. Asimple analogy will serve to illustrate this point. Imagine someone standing onthe bank of a still pond, holding a handful of small pebbles. The individualthen throws the rocks up, and they land in the pond, creating ripples andeventually, as all these waves cross and interfere with each other, a pattern orgrid or template of wave interference is created, specific to that alignment ofrocks thrown into the pond. After the pond surface has become smooth again, theindividual throws another handful of pebbles into the pond. Again, the rippleswill cross and interfere, but the pattern will be different because the rockswill randomly impact the surface of the pond in a different pattern.The “ripples” are similar to the effects of these longitudinal waves in thephysical medium, with one very important difference. In the case of the solarsystem, for example, the planets orbit the sun at known periodicity; that is,each planet takes a certain amount of time to complete one orbit of the Sun.This fact, the fact that their orbits can be precisely calculated and theirpositions relative to each other thus predicted, introduces the idea thatcertain types of alignments can occur with semi-regularity, and the physicaleffects thus can be predicted if one assembles the requisite database fromlengthy observation. That is to say, the planetary alignments themselves areexactly analogous to our “rocks in the pond,” for the planets constantly createan overlapping gridwork or template of such longitudinal waves.a. Planetary Alignments and Signal PropagationOddly enough, such observation has been done to a limited extent. In the early1950s, the RCA company engaged one of its engineers, J.H. Nelson, to study whysignal propagation strength and weakness seemed to vary according to periodiccycles. Nelson’s answers, after some study, were published in The ElectricalEngineer, and are as shocking to “normal” scientific sensibilities now as theywere then. The abstracts of these two short articles say it all.In the abstract to his article “Planetary Position Effect on Short-Wave SignalQuality,” Nelson announcesA new approach to an as yet unsolved problem is the observance of planetaryeffects on trans-atlantic [sic] short-wave signals. Correlation over seven yearsshows that certain planetary arrangements agree well with the behavior ofshort-wave signals.200 [4372.xhtml#3728]In an article written only a few months earlier for the AIEE Winter GeneralMeeting in January of 1952, Nelson spelled it out even more explicitly in theabstract, which statedAn examination of shortwave radio propagation conditions over the North Atlanticfor a five-year period, and the relative position of planets in the solarsystem, discloses some very interesting correlations. As a result of suchcorrelations, certain planetary relationships are deduced to have specificeffect on radio propagation through their influence upon the sun. Furtherinvestigation is required to fully explore the effect of planet positions onradio propagation in order that the highly important field of radio weatherforecasting may be properly developed.201 [4372.xhtml#3730]There are some important factors to observe carefully before we proceed.First, note that “certain planetary relationships” have an effect on radiosignal quality and propagation via some influence they have on the Sun. Thishighlights that another mechanism other than sheer mass is at work, for as isobvious, the Sun’s mass far outweighs the combined mass of the various planets!In other words, a standard relativistic model could not explain why signalquality varied with planetary positions; some other mechanism was at work thanjust the gravity-mass relationship posited by standard physical models. Thatmechanism, according to Nelson, had something to do with the geometries ofplanetary positions over time.Secondly, Nelson also obliquely hints that in addition to the Sun’s knowneffects on terrestrial weather, that there may also be a relationship betweenplanetary positions themselves and terrestrial weather. Were it not for the factthat Nelson was an engineer working for RCA, one might be tempted to concludethat his article was that of some obscure astrologer working anonymously for TheFarmers’ Almanac making weather predictions.But there’s more.To see what it is, it is necessary to follow Nelson’s exposition closely andcarefully. The problem first became evident when RCA erected a telescopicobservatory to study sunspot activity:At the Central Radio Office of RCA Communications, Inc., in lower Manhattan, anobservatory housing a 6-inch refracting telescope is maintained for theobservation of sunspots. The purpose of erecting this observatory in 1946 was todevelop a method of forecasting radio storms from the study of sunspots. Afterabout one year of experimenting, a forecasting system of short-wave conditionswas inaugurated based upon the age, position, classification, and activity ofsunspots. Satisfactory results were obtained, but failure of this system fromtime to time indicated that phenomena other than sunspots needed to bestudied.202 [4372.xhtml#3732]In other words, some mechanism other than sunspots was involved. But what wasit?Examining various articles by those who had studied the sunspot phenomenon inrelationship to their cycles, Nelson quickly discovered something quite odd, andit figured significantly into his own discovery:Cyclic variations in sunspot activity have been studied by many solarinvestigators in the past and attempts were made by some, notably Huntington,Clayton, and Sanford, to connect these variations to planetary influences. Thebooks of these three investigators were studied and their results foundsufficiently encouraging to warrant correlating similar planetaryinterrelationships with radio signal behavior. However, it was decided toinvestigate the effects of all the planets from Mercury to Saturn, instead ofonly the major planets as they had done. The same heliocentric angularrelationships of 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees were used and dates when any two ormore planets were separated by one of these angles were recorded.Investigation quickly showed there was positive correlation between theseplanetary angles and transatlantic shortwave signal variations. Radio signalsshowed a tendency to become degraded within a day or two of planetaryconfigurations of the type being studied. However, all configurations did notcorrespond to signal degradation. Certain configurations showed bettercorrelation than others.203 [4372.xhtml#3734]In other words, sunspot cycles themselves were not, as often argued, the causeof signal degradation, but were themselves correlated to planetary alignments;both sunspots and radio propagation effects appeared to be effects of certainplanetary geometries in relationship to the sun. And there was another thing aswell: the effect on signal propagation appeared after the geometrical alignment,which always occurred when two or more planets were separated by angles of 0,90, 180, or 270 degrees.Nelson’s articles chart some of these planetary relationships, and it is worthhaving a look at them, for a picture is indeed worth a thousand words or ahundred equations.[5709.jpeg]Nelson’s Planetary Alignment Chart for February 23, 1948, which “resulted insevere signal degradation on that day and the one following.”204[4372.xhtml#3736]Note that Venus and Jupiter are separated by 180 degrees, and Mercury by almost90 degrees from the other two. Yet another alignment that resulted in severesignal degradation was an alignment that occurred from September 20 to 26, 1951:[5710.jpeg]Nelson’s Planetary Alignments for September 20-26, 1951205 [4372.xhtml#3738]Again, observe that Saturn on the one hand, and Venus and Jupiter on the other,are separated by almost 180 degrees, while Uranus and Mercury are within a fewdegrees of each other and almost at 90-degree angles of separation from theother three planets.The similarity of these charts to normal astrological charts is, of course,obvious to anyone familiar with them, and it was so in Nelson’s day as well, forTime magazine was quick to pick up on one potential implication of the study:The ancient pseudo-science of astrology, which attempts to predict the future bythe motions of the planets, may have a bit of science in it, after all. Thisweek Radio Corporation of America, no easy prey to superstition, announced inthe RCA Review that it is successfully predicting radio reception by a study ofplanetary motions.206 [4372.xhtml#3740]To put it succinctly, Time was obliquely hinting at a kind of “paleophysics”approach to this ancient “pseudo-science,” namely that behind ancientastrological myths and lore there might have once been a very sophisticatedphysics and science — the product of a Very High Civilization — of whichastrology was a considerably declined legacy of civilizations, Egypt and Babylonfor example, that were themselves declined legacies of a much earlier and muchmore sophisticated precursor civilization. And the astrological component, as weshall see momentarily, is more than just suggested or implied.But we are getting ahead of ourselves.For the moment, let us now consider carefully the implications of Nelson’sremarks:1) Since radio signals are electromagnetic phenomena, and since signalpropagation appears to be affected by two or more planets in alignments of 0,90, 180, or 270 degrees from each other, the implication is that the solarsystem is not electrically neutral at all, but an electrically dynamic and opensystem whose dynamism is affected by these alignments. Again, recall the ideathat the planetary alignments themselves create a gridwork or lattice ortemplate of longitudinal waves;207 [4372.xhtml#3742]2) The common feature of the Sun and the planets is that each is a rotating massaround its own axis of rotation, and as a total system, each planet orbits theSun. In short, we are dealing with rotating systems within rotating systems;3) The Sun itself is a rotating mass of plasma, a super-hot electricallypolarized gas in which nuclear fusion occurs constantly. Moreover, within theSun’s mass of rotating plasma, different layers of plasma north or south of thelatitude of its equator rotate in the same direction, but at differentvelocities. This “differential rotation” as it is known will become a crucialconsideration as we proceed.But what does all this mean?To answer this question, we must return to examine some aspects of this “deepphysics” that I have written and commented about in my previous books. Many ofthese points can be reprised fairly quickly, but some of them will require acloser look, with new additional material and perspective.b. The Electrically Dynamic Solar System and Planetary AlignmentsAs already noted, the RCA studies of J.H. Nelson point to the implication thatthe solar system is not an electrically neutral system, but a dynamic one whosechanges are somehow connected to planetary alignments.208 [4372.xhtml#3744] Inmost presentations of the electrically dynamic solar system, it is to be notedthat the models used do not seek explanations in a “deeper” physics, but merelyposit that in ancient times the planets were much closer together, and as aconsequence of the buildup of polarities and charge differentials betweenplanets, large-scale electrical arcs could form between them, much like chargedifferentials between the atmosphere and the ground form during largethunderstorms, leading eventually to the electrical arcs between these regionsthat we know as lightning. In this case, the electrically dynamic solar system’sunderstanding of the way planetary alignments affect the system is simply due tothe relative closeness of celestial bodies and the relative differences ofcharge polarities between them. The actual geometrical alignment of planets — asin the example of Nelson’s RCA studies — is not really in view.c. Plasma CosmologyClosely allied to the conception of the electrically dynamic solar system isplasma cosmology, which is an attempt to see a deeper physics at work behind theidea of charge differentials forming between planets. With plasma cosmology andphysics, we are indeed in the presence of a model with profound implications forthat “deeper physics,” as well as a model with profound explanatory power forsome ancient texts and mysteries.209 [4372.xhtml#3746] Accordingly, our reviewmust be more comprehensive.I first outlined the basics, and the fundamental implications of plasmacosmology for interpretation of ancient texts and monoliths, in The Giza DeathStar. The brainchild of Swedish physicist Hannes Alfvén, the conceptual basis ofthe model was summarized by his student Eric J. Lerner in the following fashion:Starting in 1936 Alfvén outlined, in a series of highly original papers, thefundamentals of what he would later term cosmic electrodynamics — the science ofthe plasma universe. Convinced that electrical forces are involved in thegeneration of cosmic rays, Alfvén pursued … (a) method of extending laboratorymodels to the heavens…. He knew how high-energy particles are created in thelaboratory — the cyclotron, invented six years earlier, uses electrical fieldsto accelerate particles and magnetic fields to guide their paths. How, Alfvénasked, would a cosmic, natural cyclotron be possible?…But what about the conductor? Space was supposed to be a vacuum, thus incapableof carrying electrical currents. Here, Alfvén again boldly extrapolated from thelab. On earth even extremely rarified gases can carry a current if they havebeen ionized — that is, if the electrons have been stripped from the atoms….Alfvén reasoned that such plasma should exist in space as well.210[4372.xhtml#3748]I then commented at length as follows:This may not sound too revolutionary, until one notices what is unique aboutthis theory: “certain key variables do not change with scale — electricalresistance, velocity, and energy all remained the same. Other quantities dochange: for example, time is scaled as size, so if a process is a million timessmaller, it occurs a million times faster.”211 [4372.xhtml#3750] In other words…The principal differential is…time.212 [4372.xhtml#3752]Note that idea that time is “the principal differential” or “thing in view,”because it will become quite the crucial point in a moment.The principal insight of the theory is, however, clear: time is the primarydifferential or “thing in view” while the rest of physical variables —electrical resistance, field strength and so on — remain “scale-invariant,”which is a physicist’s technical terminology for saying that they behave thesame no matter the size or scale of the system to which they are applied.But there was a further implication:Since time is scale-sensitive, and other electromagnetic forces are not, theimplication is revolutionary:“Equally important, though, is the converse use of these scaling rules. When themagnetic fields and currents of these objects are scaled down, they becomeincredibly intense — millions of gauss, millions of amperes, well beyond levelsachievable in the laboratory. However, by studying cosmic phenomena, Alfvénshows, scientists can learn how fusion devices more powerful than those now inexistence will operate. In fact, they might learn how to design such devicesfrom the lessons in the heavens.”213 [4372.xhtml#3754]….Lerner clearly implies that if the inertial and electromagnetic processes of theheavens are somehow captured…That is, if one is able to reproduce them by some technological means, then“fusion devices more powerful than those in existence will operate.” What fusiondevices could he be talking about? No tokamak magnetic bottle has ever achieveda stable controlled-fusion reaction, and it is unlikely that Lerner knows about(Philo) Farnsworth’s plasmator…214 [4372.xhtml#3756](And it is even less likely that Lerner knows of the Nazi Bell device!)215[4372.xhtml#3758]…the only thing left, then, are the city-busting superbombs that fill French,American, and Russian arsenals.216 [4372.xhtml#3760]Those “city-busting superbombs” are, of course, thermonuclear hydrogen fusionbombs, and their importance to this story will also be seen in a moment.But that’s not all. There were other aspects of Alfvén’s plasma cosmology modelthat he outlined in a 1942 article:If a conducting liquid is placed in a constant magnetic field, every motion ofthe liquid gives rise to an (electromagnetic field) which produces electriccurrents. Owing to the magnetic field, these currents give mechanical forceswhich change the state of motion of the liquid. Thus a kind of combinedelectromagnetic-hydrodynamic wave is produced which, so far as I know, has asyet attracted no attention.217 [4372.xhtml#3762]Commenting on this, I noted that such electromagnetic-hydrodynamic waves soundedsuspiciously like the “electro-acoustic” or electrical longitudinal wavesdiscovered by Nikola Tesla218 [4372.xhtml#3764] in his high-frequency directcurrent impulse experiments, and later in his famous Colorado Springs electricalexperiments. We shall have much more to say on this subject in a moment.But there is one final point about Alfvén’s plasma cosmology that must be noted,and that is that this concept of the universeExhibits a filamentary and cellular structure. Not only does the universeexhibit “electric layers” of various densities like a fluid, but “cosmic plasmasare often nor homogeneous, but exhibit filamentary structures which are likelyto be associated with currents parallel to the magnetic field…. In themagnetospheres there are thin, rather stable current layers which separateregions of different magnetization, density, temperature, etc. It is necessarythat similar phenomena exist also in more distant regions. This is bound to givespace a cellular structure (or more correctly, a cell wall structure).”219[4372.xhtml#3766]Before continuing, it is essential that we pause and take stock of what we nowhave:1. Alfvén’s cosmology leads to the conception of electromagnetic-hydrodynamicwaves which are capable of traveling in vacuum space, i.e., the physical mediumitself;2. The mechanism that attaches to these waves is plasma itself, which exhibitsfluid-like properties of less and more dense regions, and thus,3. Gives space itself a cellular, that is to say, a lattice structure;4. The phenomenon of plasmas is scale-invariant, since plasma effects can becreated in the laboratory which precisely resemble entire galaxies in theirstructure,220 [4372.xhtml#3768] a point which may be fully appreciated by aglance at laboratory-generated plasma swirls, and their similarities to wholegalaxies:[5711.jpeg]Galaxies and Laboratory Plasma Pinch Effects Compared: The Galaxies are above,and the Laboratory-Generated Plasma Pinches are below.study of the above phenomena can lead to “fusion devices more powerful thanthose currently in existence,” i.e., to super-super hydrogen bombs; and finally,5. Time is the principal differential or “thing in view” since it alone variesover the scales which are in view; on small scales it operates faster than onlarge scales. This is an important point as we shall see in a moment in the workof Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev. However, given that time itself has this dynamicproperty considered in relationship to the scale of the system underconsideration, it is clear that it cannot be the sort of “one-dimensional” orscalar entity that it is in the treatment of so much mathematical physics,particularly in relativity theories.221 [4372.xhtml#3770] In short, time has akind of “breadth and depth” similar to space; it is a multi-dimensionalphenomenon, so to speak. And with this, we are back to the insights of Ouspenskycited by Dewey and Dakin in the previous chapter.222 [4372.xhtml#3772]With this in mind, we now consider the plasma and fusion aspects of the NaziBell device, and the postwar “plasma and fusion” research of Nazi scientist Dr.Ronald Richter, for his research was only secondarily about plasmas.d. Plasma Transduction of the Vacuum or Zero-Point Energy: Dr. Ronald RichterRevisitedIn The Nazi International I outlined a case that Dr. Ronald Richter’s postwarfusion project in Argentina was but a continuation of certain aspects of thewartime Nazi Bell project. This case was based in part on the fact that Richterworked for the same company, the Allgemeine Elektricitäts Gemeinschaft, as builtthe power plant for the Bell device,223 [4372.xhtml#3774] that while at thatcompany he worked on a project code-named “Charite-Anlage Projekt,” which wasone of the code names of the Bell project’s power plant,224 [4372.xhtml#3776]but most importantly, that the physics involved in Richter’s project and theBell were so similar. Both the Bell and Richter’s project involved the use ofrotating plasma.225 [4372.xhtml#3778] Both the Bell device and Richter’s projectalso involved the use of metal drums or cylinders.226 [4372.xhtml#3780]But what was the purpose of this rotation of plasma? When queried about thisprecise point by an Argentine commission sent by President Perón to investigatehis project, Richter informed the Argentine scientists that the whole basis ofhis attempt to control thermonuclear fusion processes was based on aprecessional rotation of plasma that was then sharply and abruptly pulsedelectrically to produce standing shockwaves within it. These shockwaves wouldthen induce the fusion reaction.227 [4372.xhtml#3782] Richter was, of course,roundly denounced by scientists of that day, because such assertions flew in theface of the reigning theories.228 [4372.xhtml#3784]However, this does not tell the full story, for while Richter’s views were beingdenounced publicly, privately and very secretly the U.S. military was taking aprofound interest in what the Austrian Nazi scientist was really trying to do.Contacting Richter and asking him to explain what he was doing, Richter revealsthat his project, and hence the entire Nazi Bell project, was only secondarilyconcerned with nuclear fusion, for that process was seen by them as a gateway toa much more profound, and potentially deadly, physics than mere fusion or evensuper-super hydrogen bombs. Outlining his research for the Third Reich, Richterinforms his American investigators that the shockwave process of fusion wasfirst noticed by him in 1936! His research in Nazi Germany involved:Research work and design studies on electric arc furnaces systems, developingnew types of plasma analyzing instruments and methods. In 1936, discovery of aplasma shock wave generating process, conception of a completely new type ofindustrial arc reactor system, based rather on plasma shock wave reactivity thanon heat transfer. Development of a basis of operation for testing plasma shockwave conditions by means of plasma-collision-induced nuclear reactions.229[4372.xhtml#3786]If all this sounds a little ahead of the thermonuclear game in the early 1950s,it was. It was about 45 years ahead of that game, for in 1995 an American firm,General Fusion, announced it would try to build a fusion reactor based on theprinciple of plasma shockwaves!230 [4372.xhtml#3788]But Richter had apparently seen something else in those early plasma shockwaveand fusion experiments in Nazi Germany, something that opened the door to a muchdeeper physics. “We assume,” Richter stated in his American Paperclip file,That highly compressed electron gas (i.e., a plasma) becomes a detector forenergy exchange with what we call zero-point energy…in a shockwave-superimposed,turbulence-feedback-controlled plasma zone exists a high probability forcell-like super-pressure conditions…Shades of Hannes Alfvén’s plasma-cellular structure of space! But note whatRichter is saying: such plasmas become “detectors” or even gateways to tap intothe energy of the physical medium — the zero-point energy — itself:…It seems to be possible (by this means) to ‘extract’ a compression-proportionalamount of zero-point energy by means of a magnetic-field-controlled exchangefluctuation between the compressed electron gas and a sort of cell structure inspace, representing what we call zero-point energy …. Plasma implosion analysismight turn out to become an approach to a completely new source of energy.231[4372.xhtml#3790]In short, Richter has seen beyond Alfvén’s plasma cosmology, for he is saying ineffect that the plasma structure of space itself is a result of zero-pointenergy fluctuations. And with his “whole new energy source” based on plasmagateways into the zero-point energy, we are back to Eric J. Lerner’s observationthat by looking to the heavens and the plasma processes they contain, one mightbe able to construct fusion devices far more powerful than anything in today’sarsenals, for such devices, in the final analysis, are not fusion devices assuch but fusion “gateways” or transducers of something far more powerful and ofplanet- and star-busting potential.So what is the connection to the Bell?It’s very simple.Recall for a moment that Richter’s whole process involved rotation of thatplasma such that a precession or “wobble” was induced in it. Inside the Bell,there were two counter-rotating cylinders, in my opinion most likely stacked oneon top of the other.232 [4372.xhtml#3792] Inside these cylinders a highlyradioactive compound of mercury, probably doped with high-spin-state nuclearisomers,233 [4372.xhtml#3794] was spun up to ultra-high speed, on the order oftens if not hundreds of thousands of revolutions per minute. Isomers are in turnhigh-spin-state atoms whose energy is locked up in the angular momentum of thespinning atom. The purpose of spinning such a material mechanically up to such ahigh speed is therefore evident, for such action will “cohere” the atoms of thematerial by inertia, so that they are all spinning in a manner aligned more orless on the same plane of rotation, that of the two cylinders. This material wasthen electrically pulsed by extremely high voltage direct-current electricity234[4372.xhtml#3796] which, pace Richter, arc from the rotating drum itself,through the material, to the center of the device, thus making not only aplasma, but setting up “electro-acoustic” shock waves within it, and these inturn, would transduce the energy and fabric of space-time itself, as theisomeric component of the compound deexcited from its high spin state andreleased the enormous amounts of energy stored up in its high rotation. Byaltering the speeds of counter-rotation of the two drums, a differentialrotation, a precession or “wobble” of sorts, would be artificially induced inthe plasma.In short, the Nazi scientists had brought the plasma cosmology of the stars andeven of the galaxies themselves down to a device as small as a small campingtrailer, and were using it to manipulate directly the fabric of the physicalmedium, of space-time, itself.But why set up such a differential rotation at all? For that matter, whatfactors might have led Dr. Richter to assume that a rotating (precessing) andelectrically shocked plasma might be a zero-point energy transducer to beginwith?To answer that question, we must, once again, look to the stars, to the work ofRussian astrophysicist Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev, and to little-known facts about theearliest hydrogen bomb detonations.e. Rotating Systems within Rotating Systems: Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev RevisitedTo see what the connection of all this — from rotating plasmas to thermonuclearfusion to hydrogen bombs to stars and zero-point energy — really is, we mustreturn to something I wrote way back in The Giza Death Star:During the first hydrogen bomb tests, the actual energy yield of the bombs farexceeded those initially calculated. There was an “x” factor, an unknown sourceof surplus energy that was being tapped. Since hydrogen bombs unleash enormousamounts of destructive energy at the very subatomic level of the nucleus ofatoms, we may also surmise, in part, where that energy came from and why, forsuch weapons literally cause a violent local disturbance in the geometry andfabric of space-time. In short, some as yet inadequately understood laws ofharmonics produced the excess energy.235 [4372.xhtml#3798]It is not only in the secret research of the Nazis with their Bell device, butin the work of Russian astrophysicist Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev that one begins thefinal approach to an understanding of where that excess energy came from and howit operates. We already know a part of the answer: it came from the energy ofspace-time itself.But that space-time is not a mere void devoid of dynamism, for it containsobjects and systems, it contains information, and those objects and thatinformation are undergoing an ever-changing dynamic relationship to each other.Kozyrev was confronted by a similar problem as the hydrogen bomb, only in hiscase, the problem was not with hydrogen bombs and their anomalous yields, butwith the very Sun itself, and its own highly anomalous energy yield. As I wrotein The Philosophers’ Stone: Alchemy and the Secret Research for Exotic Matter:The whole principal motivation, by his own reckoning, for his decades-longinvestigation of torsion, and of the torsion amplifying and shielding propertiesof various elements and compounds, was precisely the fact that there were simplynot enough neutrinos being emitted by stars for the standard model of stars asgigantic perpetual fusion reactors — essentially perpetual hydrogen bombs — tobe true.236 [4372.xhtml#3800]In other words, stars, like their man-made counterparts, the hydrogen bomb, weretransducing far too much energy than could be accounted for by the process ofthermonuclear fusion alone. In fact, in a certain sense, in Kozyrev’s view,fusion was not even the primary energy source at work in stars at all, but asecondary effect of something much deeper, just as in the case of Richter’sconceptions on plasmas. The connection between the two men’s research, however,may not be immediately clear unless one recalls what stars really are: they arerotating balls of plasma. Thus, Richter’s and Kozyrev’s work are pointing tosomething significant: rotating plasmas are transducers of the energy of ahigher-dimensional space! This is a crucial conceptual link to ancient times andbeliefs, and a crucial key to why the international money power, even in ancienttimes, allied itself so closely with the temple, as we shall see in subsequentchapters.And the similarity between Kozyrev and Richter is more than just conceptual, forboth men and their theories were publicly denounced in the media organs of theirrespective political blocs, while their projects apparently disappeared into thelabyrinth of postwar black projects:The more than coincidental attack on Kozyrev in Pravda in 1959 effectively[prevented] him from open publication of his experimen-tal results andtheoretical conceptualizations, and the similarly-timed disappearance ofdiscussion of clean fusion bombs in the open Soviet literature [is likewisesuspicious]. Let us speculate a bit.We have already encountered the fact that the earliest atmospheric hydrogen bombtests far exceeded their pre-test calculated yields. In other words, just as[Kozyrev maintained was happening] in stars, some other energy source was beingtapped into, and transduced by, the thermonuclear detonation itself. And if weextend this line of speculation, the Russians most likely encountered the samephenomenon in their hydrogen bomb testing. Moreover, in Kozyrev, they had anastrophysicist who thought he knew why stars, also implicating thermonuclearprocesses, appeared not to be radiating enough neutrinos energy for thethermonuclear model to be true.One may reasonably and logically conclude, therefore, that the 1959 Pravdaattack on Kozyrev was really a cover story to denounce his work, tode-legitimize it to anyone in the West who may have been paying attention to it,while Kozyrev, and his work, disappeared — as they did — into the highestreaches of classification within the Soviet Union, for his work provided thenecessary key to understand why H-bombs were returning such anomalous yields,yields that, moreover, most likely varied with the time of their detonation.Kozyrev knew why: it was because the bomb itself became, for that briefbrilliant nanosecond of the initial explosion, a dimensional gateway, asluice-gate, opening the spillway to a hyper-dimensional cascade of torsion intothe reaction itself.237 [4372.xhtml#3802]And when one says torsion, one says “rotation,” that is, the geometry of timeitself, with its rotating systems within rotating systems within rotatingsystems, for as Kozyrev throughout his many experiments demonstrated time andtime again, the simplest physical phenomena — from hydrogen bomb fusionreactions to the simple inertial properties of gyroscopes and tension balancesand scales — varied in their results over time, i.e., in accordance with theposition of celestial bodies in relationship to the earth, and to the positionon the earth and the season in which an experiment was performed. Kozyrev had ineffect demonstrated that time — the geometrical configuration and alignment ofsystems in space at any given moment — was itself a physical force and factorthat gave it breadth and depth and dimensionality. He had given the effects ofso many cycles as compiled by Dewey and Dakin, and even the sunspot alignmentsof RCA’s J.H. Nelson, a name: torsion.In stressing this geometric aspect of time and its “multi-dimensionality” — itsrelationship to the ever-changing torsion dynamism of objects in space, their“template” — Kozyrev could not possibly have been blind to what he was actuallysaying, for he was saying also that there may well be, or have been, long ago, ascientific basis to astrology, a basis now all but forgotten.And there is one final point in this torsion tale to consider. The Sun, while arotating plasma, is not a plasma that rotates with uniform velocity, for if oneconsiders various layers of this plasma from its equator north, or south, asmany solar physicists know, the plasma rotates at different speeds, i.e., theSun itself is the largest example in our celestial neighborhood of thephenomenon of differential rotation of a plasma. As such, it is the example parexcellence of torsion.A simple analogy will illustrate this point. In numerous discussions on radioshows I have been asked to illustrate what torsion does to the fabric ofspace-time, of the physical medium. The example I always use is that of emptyingan aluminum soda can, and then wringing it like a dishrag. The analogy issimilar to the Bell’s two counter-rotating cylinders, for the counter-rotationof the wringing motion will spiral, fold, and pleat the can, which representsspace-time. But imagine now that one is wringing the soda can with both handsgoing the same direction, but with one hand going very much faster than theother: the result will be exactly the same. The can will be spiraled, folded,and pleated.Thus, the analogy serves to demonstrate an important point both about the NaziBell research and about Kozyrev’s research, for in both cases the torsionphysics in evidence in plasmas was fully rationalized by both parties. Moreover,in stressing this geometric aspect of time and its “multi-dimensionality” — itsrelationship to the ever-changing dynamism of objects in space — Kozyrev couldnot possibly have been blind to what he was actually saying, for he was sayingthat there may well be, or have been, a scientific basis to astrology now allbut forgotten.There was, however, one genius in particular, working at the turn of thenineteenth into the twentieth century, and at the dreadful moment that thedeliberate and heavy hand of suppression of this physics and all itsimplications could clearly be seen and felt, who saw it all with a perspicacityand breathtaking vision, and who inspired the efforts of the Nazis and Sovietsto free themselves from that heavy hand:Nikola Tesla."},{"pageContent":"B. ALL ROADS LEAD TO TESLA AND MORGANOne need only consider the conspicuous absence of Tesla’s name from standardphysics textbooks in order to appreciate the fact of the existence of thishidden physics and its deliberate suppression. It was evident in the publicdenunciations of Dr. Ronald Richter and Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev, and the quietshuffling of their projects into classified obscurity and secrecy. But unlikethose two geniuses, with Nikola Tesla one was dealing with an entirely differentmatter, for the man was not only not an obscure scientist and engineer workingquietly in his laboratories on secret government projects, but he was aflamboyant and well-known public figure who delighted in large and expensivedinners in New York City’s finest restaurants, who literally electrifiedaudiences of the rich and famous — including such notables such as Mark Twainhimself — with exhilarating public demonstrations of his inventions, and whosefame, quite literally, spread quickly worldwide with electrifying speed, for heindeed was the sole man responsible for electrifying the world after an equallyfamous contest with Thomas Edison and his financial backer J.P. Morgan — acontest which Tesla easily and decisively won.Such a man could not simply be denounced, nor shuffled to the sidelines. Norcould such a man be dealt with by more “active measures” without casting a pallof suspicion over the ultimate perpetrators of the deed.But why would Tesla pose such a problem to begin with?"},{"pageContent":"1. Colorado SpringsThe answer lies in what Tesla discovered during his famous experiments inColorado Springs in the late nineteenth century, experiments which, to this day,few physicists and engineers really understand, and those few who do questioneither Tesla’s claims, his analysis, or both. The reason for the difficulty inunderstanding among some scientists, and the questioning attitude and skepticismamong others, lies in the nature of what Tesla himself claimed he had been ableto do. It is necessary to cite his comments at length:Towards the close of 1898 a systematic research, carried on for a number ofyears with the object of perfecting a method of transmission of electricalenergy through the natural medium, led me to recognize three importantnecessities: First, to develop a transmitter of great power; second, to perfectmeans for individualizing and isolating the energy transmitted; and third, toascertain the laws of propagation of currents through the earth and theatmosphere.238 [4372.xhtml#3804]The Colorado Springs project was, in other words, the beginning of Tesla’s nowwell-known idea of beaming electrical power itself without wires. This isalready a step well beyond radio.Observe carefully, however, what Tesla states. In order to do this, it wasnecessary to1. construct a kind of transmitter of extraordinary power;2. to render any wireless transmission of power practical, it was necessary tobe able to send and receive a multitude of individual signals for the variousequipment and localities it was presumably to serve, and thus, a means had to befound to “individualize and isolate” the transmitted energy, much as a radioreceiver can tune to various frequencies to receive different signals; andfinally, and most importantly,3. Tesla clearly states that the “natural medium” itself is to be the means ofpropagation of this energy.But what does he mean by “natural medium”? The interpretation of this one pointis crucial to the understanding of what he was really seeking in ColoradoSprings, and it is this precise point over which the misunderstandings,arguments, and the skeptical questions, arise.There are three possible ways to understand Tesla here. The first is tounderstand by “natural medium” what Tesla later declares in the same context:the atmosphere, and the earth itself. In the first instance, the atmosphere,Tesla is proposing little more than a high-power version of radio. In the secondcase, however, it is clear that he is proposing something radically different,for the earth itself is to be the transmitter. This interpretation, as we shalldiscover, is that which clearly will emerge from the rest of Tesla’s remarks.However, there is one final interpretation, the most radical of them all, thatwill loom ever larger as we proceed. Tesla, like many physicists and engineersof his day, was an ardent believer in the aether, that is, in the fact thatspace-time itself was a kind of ultra-fine matter upon which electromagneticwaves, and hence energy and power, could ride. Tesla, however, appears, unlikemost physicists and engineers of his time, to have held the view that thisaether had fluid-like properties, i.e., that it had the ability to be compressedor rarefied, that is, to be stressed. This will emerge as a clear implication ofhis Colorado Springs experiments.To see how, we return to his own remarks, to understand how he intended toutilize the earth itself as the transmitting antenna for electrical power:In the middle of June, while preparations for other work were going on, Iarranged one of my receiving transformers with the view of determining in anovel manner, experimentally, the electric potential of the globe and studyingthe periodic and casual fluctuations. This formed part of a plan carefullymapped out in advance. A highly sensitive, self-restorative device, controllinga recording instrument, was included in the secondary circuit, while the primarywas connected to the ground and an elevated terminal of adjustable capacity. Thevariations of potential gave rise to electric surgings in the primary; thesegenerated secondary currents, which in turn affected the sensitive device andrecorder in proportion to their intensity. The earth was found to be, literally,alive with electrical vibrations, and soon I was deeply absorbed in thisinvestigation.239 [4372.xhtml#3806]On conclusion of these investigations, having discovered that indeed the earthitself was an electrically dynamic system, Tesla concluded thatNot only was it practicable to send telegraphic messages to any distance withoutwires, as I recognized long ago, but also to impress upon the entire globe thefaint modulations of the human voice,(In other words, Tesla was thinking in terms of radio, but with the entire earthas his transmitting antenna!)[but] far more still, to transmit power, in unlimited amounts, to anyterrestrial distance and almost without any loss.240 [4372.xhtml#3808]Tesla then turned to the problem of developing not only a powerful transmitter,but one that could best be used for all these discrete and disparate purposes.And it is precisely here that the misunderstandings begin, for most engineers tothis day think that Tesla’s “magnifying impulse transmitter” was nothing but aTesla coil beaming powerful bolts of electricity into the atmosphere.To see how different was Tesla’s system than any other then being considered,one must look closer at what he himself describes happened in Colorado Springs.Noting the typical Colorado thunderstorms which formed over the mountains andthen moved quickly over the plains, Tesla begins a lengthy description of theevents leading to his discovery of the method of electrically stressing theearth itself:I never saw fire balls,241 [4372.xhtml#3810] but as a compensation for mydisappointment I succeeded later in determining the mode of their formation andproducing them artificially.In the latter part of the same month (June) I noticed several times that myinstruments were affected stronger by discharges taking place at great distancesthan by those near by. This puzzled me very much. What was the cause? A numberof observations proved that it could not be due to the differences in theintensity of the individual discharges,242 [4372.xhtml#3812] and I readilyascertained that the phenomenon was not the result of a varying relation betweenthe periods of my receiving circuits and those of terrestrial disturbances….It was on the third of July — the date I shall never forget — when I obtainedthe first decisive experimental evidence of a truth of overwhelming importancefor the advancement of humanity. A dense mass of strongly charged cloudsgathered in the west and towards the evening a violent storm broke loose which,after spending much of its fury in the mountains, was driven away with greatvelocity over the plains. Heavy and long persisting arcs formed almost inregular time intervals….I was able to handle my instruments quickly and I wasprepared. The recording apparatus being properly adjusted, its indicationsbecame fainter and fainter with the increasing distance of the storm, until theyceased altogether. I was watching in eager expectation. Surely enough, in alittle while the indications again began, grew stronger and stronger and, afterpassing through a maximum, gradually decreased and ceased once more. Many times,in regularly recurring intervals, the same actions were repeated until the stormwhich, as evident from simple computations, was moving with nearly constantspeed, had retreated to a distance of about three hundred kilometers. Nor didthese strange actions stop then, but continued to manifest themselves withundiminished force…. No doubt whatever remained: I was observing stationarywaves.….Impossible as it seemed, this planet, despite its vast extent, behaved like aconductor of limited dimensions .243 [4372.xhtml#3814]In other words, Tesla, in Dewey- and Dakin-like fashion, had observed a cycle,and a very interesting one at that, for the cycle he had observed was a“stationary wave,” or, in modern parlance, a “standing wave.” When the extremelyhigh-voltage static electrical discharges that we call lightning strike theearth, if the resonance is right it literally “thumps” the earth like a kettledrum, sending an impulse all the way around the planet somewhat like a seismicwave from an earthquake. Like all such waves, it will eventually fade and die,then grow again until it returns to the same place and intensity from which itstarted. And this gave him the idea for the “wireless transmission” ofelectrical power.However, nothing could have been farther from Tesla’s mind than standard radio.This new circuit is, he noted,Essentially, a circuit of very high self-induction and small resistance which inits arrangement, mode of excitation and action, may be said to be thediametrical opposite of a transmitting circuit typical of telegraphy by Hertzianor electromagnetic radiations…. The electromagnetic radiations being reduced toan insignificant quantity, and proper conditions of resonance maintained, thecircuit acts like an immense pendulum, storing indefinitely the energy of theprimary exciting impulses and impressions upon the earth and its conductingatmosphere uniform harmonic oscillations which, as actual tests have shown, maybe pushed so far as to surpass those attained in the natural displays of staticelectricity.244 [4372.xhtml#3816]To unpack what he is saying, one only has to consider the standard radiotransmission arrangement, sending out ordinary radio waves. In this arrangement,there is an antenna, connected to the ground. The antenna sends out Hertzianwaves into the atmosphere, and the circuit is completed by its connection to theground. Hertz waves are similar in nature to suspending a jump rope looselybetween two people and having one person jerk the rope, sending an “S”-shapedwave slowly to the other end. Most of the energy of the wave is dissipated inthe initial “jerking” motion, and accordingly, only a fraction of the energyarrives at the other person, the rest of the energy being dissipated by theup-and-down motion of the wave itself. In this case, the jump rope representsthe earth’s electrically conductive atmosphere, and the wave in the roperepresents the ordinary radio wave.Recall now what Tesla stated: his circuit parameters were diametrically theopposite of a standard “radio” arrangement, for in this instance, therelationship of ground and transmitter were turned on their heads, the earth,normally the ground in an electrical circuit, became the transmitter andconductive medium, and the atmosphere, normally the conductive medium, becamethe ground.245 [4372.xhtml#3818] Moreover, in this new arrangement, the waveswere not Hertzian at all, but impulses; that is to say, they were longitudinalwaves of stress, of compression and rarefaction, in the earth itself.To understand the crucial difference between the two waves, we repeat our jumprope analogy, only this time, we place a yardstick between the two persons. Oneperson pushes or pulses the yardstick repeatedly. Instantaneously, all of theenergy of the pulse is transmitted directly to the other person. In this case,the yardstick represents the earth, and the pulses the electro-acousticlongitudinal waves Tesla is sending.This is, to put it succinctly, a far cry from radio in the standard sense, forTesla means not only to transmit signals by this means, but electrical poweritself, without wires, for the earth itself is the wire.246 [4372.xhtml#3820]Note also what the earth is in this system: it is a highly non-linear medium ofalmost infinite electrical “resistance” to a standard electrical current. Thiswill assume some importance as we proceed.In any case, once having envisioned this radically different system, Tesla wenton to describe what for all practical purposes amounted to an “internet”:The results obtained by me have made my scheme of intelligence transmission, forwhich the name of “World Telegraphy” has been suggested, easily realizable….Thusthe entire earth will be converted into a huge brain, as it were, capable ofresponse in every one of its parts.247 [4372.xhtml#3822]In fact, this is an “internet” beyond anything currently imaginable, for it hasno need of wires, “gateway computers,” or satellites in order to function. InTesla’s grand vision, the earth fulfills these functions."},{"pageContent":"2. WardenclyffeWhen he returned to New York City, Tesla was ready to put the scheme intocommercial testing. And this is where Tesla’s difficulties began, and wheresuppression of the physics and engineering his system represented was clearlyevident, for needing funds to build a large-scale version of his ColoradoSprings experimental apparatus, Tesla, as is now well known, approached theAmerican international banker J. Pierpont Morgan for a loan. Detailing his planfor a global system of “wireless telegraphy,” even proposing to send the humanvoice and actual pictures by its means in a kind of terrestrial radio andtelevision, Morgan advanced Tesla the funds. What Tesla did not reveal to Morganat this juncture was that he intended to transmit electrical power itself bythis means, making even his own stupendously successful system of alternatingcurrent — the system now in use worldwide — obsolete! Tesla chose a place onLong Island, purchased land, built a power plant, and a large tower. He calledthe place and the project “Wardenclyffe.”Unfortunately for Tesla and his plans, however, the Italian physicist andengineer Guigliomo Marconi — using Tesla’s own devices and inventions to boot! —beat him to the punch by transmitting the first transatlantic radio signal,using standard radio circuit arrangements and Hertzian “jump rope”electromagnetic waves while Tesla’s project was still under construction. Facedwith cheaper competition and a deceptively simpler, but much less flexible,system, Morgan threatened to pull the financial plug on the scheme. It was then,faced with the demise of his project, that Tesla revealed his true intentions toMorgan: he planned to beam power itself through the earth to any point on theglobe. With this revelation, Morgan did pull the plug, and Tesla’s grand projectcame to an end, and has never since been publicly revived.a. Weaponizing Wardenclyffe and Suppressing the Scalars: Tesla at Tunguska andMorgan at MischiefWhy would Morgan pull the plug on such a scheme, virtually suppressing it andthe physics it represented? After all, it is simply not true merely that he“could not meter” it and hence make money, for he stood to gain a great dealfinancially off of worldwide royalty and licensing agreements for the system,even though such a system would, admittedly, have been much more difficult tofinancially monitor and secure. So while pure and simple greed may very likelyhave been a factor in his deliberations, it probably was not the only one.What those other modifications may have been were hinted at by Tesla himself,and a curious series of incidents that began when a French ship, the Iena,mysteriously exploded in 1907, as Tesla’s Wardenclyffe project was in itsfinancial death throes. In an op-ed piece written that March to the editor ofthe New York Times, Tesla hinted at the weaponization potential of his ColoradoSprings discoveries and Wardenclyffe project:As to projecting wave-energy to any particular region of the globe, I have givena clear description of the means in technical publications. Not only can this bedone by the means of my devices, but the spot at which the desired effect is tobe produced can be calculated very closely, assuming the accepted terrestrialmeasurements to be correct. This, of course, is not the case. Up to this day wedo not know a diameter of the globe within one thousand feet. My wireless plantwill enable me to determine it within fifty feet or less, when it will bepossible to rectify many geodetical data and make such calculations as thosereferred to with greater accuracy.248 [4372.xhtml#3824]A year later in 1908, the inventor was less guarded in his words:When I spoke of future warfare I meant that it should be conducted by directapplication of electrical waves without the use of aerial engines or otherimplements of destruction. This means, as I pointed out, would be ideal, for notonly would the energy of war require no effort for the maintenance of itspotentiality, but it would be productive in times of peace. This is not a dream.Even now wireless power plants could be constructed by which any region of theglobe might be rendered uninhabitable without subjecting the population of otherparts to serious danger or inconvenience.249 [4372.xhtml#3826]These words were published in the New York Times on April 28, 1908. Bear thatdate in mind, because it will become highly significant in a moment. In anycase, it is also clear that Tesla’s wireless transmission of power was one andthe same technology as a horrible weapon of mass destruction. And this raises anominous series of questions: Had J.P. Morgan pulled his financial backing of theproject not out of greed, but, perhaps motivated by some secret scientificadvisor’s cautionary warnings, had he pulled his financial backing because hedid not wish to see technology with such destructive potential in the privatehands of a scientist well known for very odd and eccentric behavior? WereMorgan’s motivations ultimately altruistic? Or, conversely, did he want todevelop the technology for such purposes secretly himself, and by means of itspotential use, establish a world mastery for himself and his own class?To put it succinctly, as with the presence of the Mitsubishi bank economist inthe membership roles of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles, or the peculiarinvestigations of RCA engineer J.H. Nelson, this is the third clear instance ofa major corporation, secure in its own monetary temple, showing a clearinterest, first in the development of a deep physics, a radically differentphysics, and now, the first clear indication of a deliberate act of financialsabotage of the same physics! This pattern will only become more and more acuteas we proceed throughout this book.But in that very same article, Tesla makes clear that he has seen beyond his ownsystem of using the earth itself as an antenna to an even deeper underlyingphysics, a physics he did not disclose at the time to Morgan but which now,desperate for financial support for his project, he now disclosed publicly inthe pages of the New York Times:What I said in regard to the greatest achievement of the man of science whosemind is bent upon the mastery of the physical universe, was nothing more thanwhat I stated in one of my unpublished addresses, from which I quote: “Accordingto an adopted theory, every ponderable atom is differentiated from a tenuousfluid, filling all space merely by spinning motion, as a whirl of water in acalm lake. By being set in movement this fluid, the ether, becomes gross matter.Its movement arrested, the primary substance reverts to its normal state. Itappears, then, possible for man through harnessed energy of the medium andsuitable agencies for starting and stopping ether whirls to cause matter to formand disappear. At his command, almost without effort on his part, old worldswould vanish and new ones would spring into being. He could alter the size ofthis planet, control its seasons, adjust its distance from the sun, guide it onits eternal journey along any path he might choose through the depths of theuniverse. He could make planets collide and produce his suns and stars, his heatand light; he could originate life in all its infinite forms. To cause at willthe birth and death of matter would be man’s grandest deed, which would give himthe mastery of physical creation, make him fulfill his ultimate destiny.250[4372.xhtml#3828]Note now that by “medium” Tesla no longer means simply the earth itself, but theaether. And notably, he views atoms themselves as but vorticular structures —rotating, torsion-based systems — in that aether. If Morgan had any doubts in1907 about the potentials — both destructive and constructive — of Tesla’ssystem and the physics it embodied, those doubts were clearly dispelled a yearlater by Tesla himself in The New York Times.Note also that Tesla, by viewing the physical medium in this torsion-basedfashion, has also clearly seen one implication: the aether itself was atransmutative, alchemical information-creating medium, a medium which, asinformation-creating, was in a state of non-equilibrium and broken symmetry.Thus, with the proper structuring of that “torsion potential,” by engineeringit, one could literally alter the size and mass of the earth or any othercelestial body at will, for those bodies were themselves “whirls in the aether.”Small wonder then that he, like Drs. Richter and Kozyrev after him, was creatingball lightning and thereby studying plasmas and electrical shocks, for likethem, he has seen the much deeper physics of the physical medium itself, andlike them, he has discovered the basic method of manipulating and engineering itthrough electrical pulses or longitudinal waves, and through rotation. And likethem and their Nazi and Communist masters, he has seen the full range of itsconstructive and destructive implications. In this, and without the slightestexaggeration, his views of physics gave a solid basis to a very ancientpseudo-science: alchemy.But why is the timing of Tesla’s announcement so significant?One researcher who asked this question was Oliver Nichelson:The question remains of whether Tesla demonstrated the weapons application ofhis power transmission system. Circumstantial evidence found in the chronologyof Tesla’s work and financial fortunes between 1900 and 1908 points to therehaving been a test of this weapon.251 [4372.xhtml#3830]Recall that Tesla’s first veiled hints of the weaponization potential of hiswireless power transmission system were stated in 1907 and clearly expressed byApril 1908. Roughly two months later, on June 30, 1908, a massive explosionoccurred over Tunguska, Russia, in Siberia.An explosion estimated to be equivalent to 10-15 megatons of TNT252[4372.xhtml#3832] flattened 500,000 acres of pine forest near the Stony TunguskaRiver in central Siberia. Whole herds of reindeer were destroyed. The explosionwas heard over a radius of 620 miles. When an expedition was made to the area in1927 to find evidence of the meteorite presumed to have caused the blast, noimpact crater was found. When the ground was drilled for pieces of nickel, iron,or stone, the main constituents of meteorites, none were found down to a depthof 118 feet.253 [4372.xhtml#3834]Many explanations have been given for the Tunguska event. The officiallyaccepted version is that a 100,000-ton fragment of Encke’s Comet, composedmainly of dust and ice, entered the atmosphere at 62,000 m.p.h., heated up, andexploded over the earth’s surface creating a fireball and shock wave but nocrater. Alternative versions of the disaster see a renegade mini-black hole oran alien space ship crashing into the earth254 [4372.xhtml#3836] with theresulting release of energy.255 [4372.xhtml#3838]As was already seen, Tesla had two short months earlier spelled out theweaponization potential of his magnifying transmitter device and its underlyingdeep physics very clearly.Many years later in 1934, according to a letter unearthed by Tesla biographerMargaret Cheney, the inventor once again wrote J.P. Morgan:The flying machine has completely demoralized the world, so much so that in somecities, as London and Paris, people are in mortal fear from aerial bombing. Thenew means I have perfected affords absolute protection against this and otherforms of attack… These new discoveries I have carried out experimentally on alimited scale, created a profound impression.256 [4372.xhtml#3840]At this point one might ask, what prompted the letter? Was it spontaneous onTesla’s part? Or a reply to an inquiry from the financier? Whatever lay behindthis strange correspondence, occurring years after the financier had severed hisconnection with Tesla and all but suppressed the Wardenclyffe wireless powertransmission project, the correspondence is odd to say the least.Its implications however, are clear. Tesla’s remarks in the New York Times in1908, the same year as the event, and his letter years later in 1934 to Morgan,point to a circumstantial case that he indeed tested the weaponization potentialof his wireless power transmission on a remote wilderness region, a region wherethere would be sufficient observation of the event from a distance, but no lossof human life. Indeed, in purely legal terms, he had “the motive and the meansto cause the Tunguska event. His transmitter could generate energy levels andfrequencies capable of releasing the destructive force of 10 megatons, or more,of TNT. And the overlooked genius was desperate.”257 [4372.xhtml#3842]But as Nichelson also observes, the nature of the Tunguska explosion is alsoentirely consistent with what would happenwith the sudden release of wireless power. No fiery object was reported in theskies at that time by professional or amateur astronomers as would be expectedwhen a 200,000,000-pound object enters the atmosphere at tens of thousands ofmiles an hour. Also, the first reporters, from the town of Tomsk, to reach thearea judged the stories about a body falling from the sky was the result of theimagination of an impressionable people. He noted there was considerable noisecoming from the explosion, but no stones fell. The absence of an impact cratercan be explained by there having been no material body to impact. An explosioncaused by broadcast power would not leave a crater.In contrast to the ice comet collision theory, reports of upper-atmosphere andmagnetic disturbances coming from other parts of the world at the time of andjust after the Tunguska event point to massive changes in earth’s electricalcondition. Baxter and Atkins cite in their study of the explosion, The Fire CameBy, that the Times of London editorialized about “slight, but plainly marked,disturbances of…magnets”….In Berlin, the New York Times of July 3rd reported unusual colors in the eveningskies thought to be Northern Lights…Massive glowing “silvery clouds” coveredSiberia and northern Europe. A scientist in Holland told of an “undulating mass”moving across the northwest horizon. It seemed to him not to be a cloud, but the“sky itself seemed to undulate.” A woman north of London wrote the London Timesthat on midnight of July 1st the sky glowed so brightly it was possible to readlarge print inside her house. A meteorological observer in England recounted onthe nights of June 30th and July 1st: “A strong orange-yellow light becamevisible in the north and northeast… causing an undue prolongation of twilightlasting to daybreak on July 1st… There was a complete absence of scintillationor flickering, and no tendency for the formation of streamers, or a luminousarch, characteristic of auroral phenomena….Twilight on both of these nights wasprolonged to daybreak, and there was no real darkness.”…When Tesla used his high-power transmitter as a directed-energy weapon hedrastically altered the normal electrical condition of the earth. By making theelectrical charge of the planet vibrate in tune with his transmitter he was ableto build up electric fields that affected compasses and caused the upperatmosphere to behave like the gas-filled lamps in his laboratory. He had turnedthe entire globe into a simple electrical component that he could control.258[4372.xhtml#3844]But was a “simple” wireless transmission of power all that was involved in theexplosion? After all, we have already found Drs. Richter and Kozyrev questioningthe standard models of thermonuclear fusion, and Tesla himself by 1908, clearlyseeing a deeper physics of the medium itself, was involved in his own wirelesspower transmission principles.More importantly, flattening an area of 500,000 acres is equivalent toflattening an area of 781.25 square miles, or roughly an area of a squarebounded by sides almost 28 miles long! So some other mechanism might be in play,and Tesla has already told us what it might have been: whirls in the aetheritself — torsion, rotation.However, Tesla had foreseen even further political implications for his system,and it is worth citing him at length:Through the universal adoption of this system, ideal conditions for themaintenance of law and order will be realized, for then the energy necessary tothe enforcement of right and justice will be normally productive, yet(potentially) and in any moment available, for attack and defense. The powertransmitted need not be necessarily destructive, for if existence is made todepend upon it, its withdrawal or supply will bring about the same results asthose now accomplished by force of arms.But when unavoidable, the same agent may be used to destroy property and life.The art is already so far developed that great destructive effects can beproduced at any point on the globe, determined beforehand and with greataccuracy. In view of this I have not thought it hazardous to predict a few yearsago that the wars of the future will not be waged with explosives but withelectrical means.259 [4372.xhtml#3846]In other words, like the “gods” of extremely ancient times,260 [4372.xhtml#3848]Tesla saw in his technology of wireless power transmission a means of worldmastery and hegemony, whose implied threat of withdrawal of access, or evenworse, the implied threat of its destructive weaponized deployment, would coercecompliance to whatever world order as possessed, monopolized, and deployed it.Such statements could hardly have gone unnoticed by Tesla’s former financialbacker, J.P. Morgan.But whatever Morgan’s interest may have been, foreign nations were mostcertainly also watching these statements carefully. As Oliver Nichelson notes,the American media carried many stories of “death ray” research being conductedin the wake of Tesla’s statements to the New York Times in Russia,261[4372.xhtml#3850] France,262 [4372.xhtml#3852] and Great Britain.263[4372.xhtml#3854]In the last instance, Tesla biographer John J. O’Neill noted in an unpublishedchapter to his celebrated biography of the inventor, Prodigal Genius, that whenhe queried the engineer about his wireless power transmission technology and itsweaponization potential, Tesla became very reluctant to speak about it in anydetail. But later, Tesla did offer some interesting information:Somewhat later I learned the reason for Tesla’s reluctance to discuss thedetails. This came shortly after Stanley Baldwin replaced Neville Chamberlain asPrime Minister of Great Britain [sic].Tesla revealed that he had carried on negotiations with Prime MinisterChamberlain for the sale of his ray system to Great Britain for $30,000,000 onthe basis of his presentation that the device would provide complete protectionfor the British Isles against any enemy approaching by sea or air, and wouldprovide an offensive weapon to which there was no defense. He was convinced, hedeclared, of the sincerity of Mr. Chamberlain and his intent to adopt the deviceas it would have prevented the outbreak of the then threatening war, and wouldhave made possible the continuation — under the duress which this weapon wouldhave made possible — of the working agreement involving France, Germany andBritain to maintain the status quo in Europe. When Chamberlain failed, at theMunich conference, to retain this state of European equilibrium it was necessaryto get rid of Chamberlain and install a new Prime Minister who could make theeffort to shift one corner of the triangle from Germany to Russia. Baldwin foundno virtue in Tesla’s plan and peremptorily ended negotiations.264[4372.xhtml#3856]However, there is a large looming problem over hovering over these assertions,and that is simply the sequence of historical facts.Neville Chamberlain remained Prime Minister until the Nazi invasion of the LowCountries and France in May of 1940, and did not, as is alleged, step aside forStanley Baldwin to return to Britain’s premiership after the Munich Conferenceof 1938. In fact, Chamberlain remained, even after Churchill had replaced him,on Churchill’s War Cabinet until his death a few months later from cancer. Theentire sequence of events is wrong, for it was Chamberlain who had replacedBaldwin as prime minister in 1937. And in any case, it is unlikely thatChamberlain, who pursued a policy of appeasement with Nazi Germany, would havebeen interested in a weapon of mass destruction that, had the Germans caughtwind of the plan as they inevitably would have, would have exacerbated tensionsbetween the two nations even more.But need one discard these allegations merely for the presence of this(admittedly whopping) historical mistake?Perhaps not, for it is possible that O’Neill is simply recording accurately whatTesla told him, and Tesla, then already a very old man, might have notremembered things in their precise sequence, confusing Chamberlain with Baldwin.On this reading, admittedly only a possibility, Tesla’s deal was beingnegotiated with Stanley Baldwin, and the deal was subsequently scrubbed byChamberlain on his assumption of the premiership and in the interests ofappeasement.All this is mentioned because, of course, there is one country conspicuouslyabsent from the previous roll call of countries involved with “death ray”research in the 1920s: Germany. However, as researcher Oliver Nichelsonobserves, the Germans were indeed working on such a weapon, for the ChicagoTribune reported the following interesting little story:Berlin - That the German Government has an invention of death rays that willbring down airplanes, halt tanks on the battlefields, ruin automobile motors,and spread a curtain of death like the gas clouds of the recent war was theinformation given to Reichstag members by Herr Wulle, chief of the militaristsin that body. It is learned that three inventions have been perfected in Germanyfor the same purpose and have been patented.265 [4372.xhtml#3858]Self-evidently, such stories abounded in the 1920s in the wake of Tesla’spronouncements, but there are sound reasons to take them seriously, especiallyin the case of Germany.Under the terms of the Versailles Treaty, Germany was prohibited fromdevelopment of heavy artillery over certain calibers, and absolutely prohibitedfrom having tanks or even an air force, and its standing army was limited to amere 100,000 men. However, the Treaty did not prohibit development of thesetypes of weapons, and thus it is logical to assume that Germany in particularwould seek to do a technological end-run around the restrictions of thetreaty.266 [4372.xhtml#3860]Even more interesting, however, is the fact that Nichelson reports that oneBritish researcher allegedly involved in the development of such systems, J.H.Hamil, observed that the German system was based “on an entirely differentprinciple” than those in evidence in other reports.267 [4372.xhtml#3862] WhileHamil explicitly states that his own “death ray” is based on Tesla’s ColoradoSprings wireless power transmission experiments,268 [4372.xhtml#3864] it is alsointeresting that it appears that he misinterpreted the nature of thoseexperiments, for he built a large Tesla coil and was apparently attempting tobeam power by its means through the atmosphere, the exact opposite, it will berecalled, of what Tesla was trying to do. This makes his statements all thatmuch more interesting, for by pursuing “an entirely different principle” werethe Germans in fact using the earth as the transmitter, and the atmosphere asthe ground, as Tesla himself indicated? We will never know, but it isinteresting to note that whatever they were doing, it was not the same as whateveryone else was doing, according to Hamil.269 [4372.xhtml#3866]b. Lt. Col. Tom Bearden on Scalar ResonanceBut what is precisely the relationship between Tesla’s use of the earth itselfas his transmitter, and the far more dangerous idea he himself suggests, thatsuch “standing waves” as he observed at Colorado Springs, could be used as ameans of engineering and manipulating the physical medium itself for whateverpurpose, constructive or destructive?The answers to this question are provided in certain suggestive statements Teslamade in a trial transcript during a trial in New York state. Tesla, now in direfinancial straits after J.P. Morgan stopped all further backing of theWardenclyffe wireless power transmission project, had given the deed of hisWardenclyffe property to the owner of a hotel where he resided as security inreturn for him being allowed to room in the hotel. When Tesla was unable to paythe hotel bill the owner naturally enough foreclosed on the property, winning ajudgment against Tesla. Tesla appealed the case, and it is this transcript thatcontains some interesting descriptions of the Wardenclyffe property by Tesla,and some even more interesting allusions to the physics properties he thought tobe behind it. I cite the transcript at length:By Mr. Hawkins:Q. Were there any other structures upon the premises other than that brickfactory or laboratory which you have just described?A. (Tesla speaking) Yes sir, there was the structure which in a certain sensewas the most important structure, because the power plant was only an accessoryto it. That was the tower.Q. Please describe the tower as to dimensions and material and method ofconstruction and kind of construction?Mr. Fordham: We renew our objection, if the Court please. This is entirelyimmaterial, irrelevant and incompetent until after they have succeeded inestablishing their contention that the deed is a mortgage.The Referee: I will take it.Mr. Fordham: Exception.A. The tower was 187 feet high from the base to the top. It was built of specialtimber and it was built in such a way that every stick could be taken out at anytime and replaced if it was necessary. The design of the tower was a matter ofconsiderable difficulty. It was made in the shape of an octagon and pyramidalform for strength and was supporting what I have termed in my scientificarticles a terminal.By the Referee:Q. There was a sort of globe at the top?A. Yes. That, your Honor, was only the carrying out of a discovery I made thatany amount of electricity within reason could be stored provided you make it ofa certain shape. Electricians even today do not appreciate that yet. But thatconstruction enabled me to produce with this small plant many times the effectthat could be produced by an ordinary plant of a hundred times the size. Andthis globe, the framework was all specially shaped, that is the girders had tobe bent in shape and it weighed about 55 tons.By Mr. Hawkins:Q. Of what was it constructed?A. Of steel, all the girders being specially bent into shape.Q. Was the tower that supported it entirely constructed of wood or partly ofsteel?A. That part alone on top was of steel. The tower was all timbers and of coursethe timbers were held together by specially-shaped steel plates.The Referee: Braces?The Witness: Yes, steel plates. I had to construct it this way for technicalreasons.The Referee: We are not interested in that.Q. Was the tower enclosed or open?A. The tower, at the time of the execution of this deed, was open, but I havephotographs to show how it looked exactly and how it would have looked finished.Q. After you delivered the deed was the tower ever enclosed?A. No, it was just open.Q. Now the dome or terminal at the top, was that enclosed?A. No sir.Q. Never enclosed?A. Never enclosed, no.Q. Had that structure ever been completed?A. The structure so far, if I understand the terms right, yes, the structure wasall completed but the accessories were not placed on it yet. For instance thatglobe there was to be covered with specially pressed plates. These plates —Q. That had not been done, had it?A. That had not been done, although I had it all prepared. I had preparedeverything, I had designed and prepared everything, but it was not done.270[4372.xhtml#3870]Q. Was the structure of the tower in any manner connected with the brickbuilding or power plant?A. The tower was separate.Q. I understand, but was there any connection between them?A. There were of course two channels. One was for communicating, for bringinginto the tower compressed air and water and such things as I might have neededfor operations, and the other one was to bring in the electric mains.By the Referee:Q. In order to do that there was, as a matter of fact, was there not, awell-like shaft going down right in the middle of the tower into the ground some50 or 60 feet?A. Yes. You see the underground work is one of the most expensive parts of thetower. In this system that I have invented it is necessary for the machine toget a grip of the earth, otherwise it cannot shake the earth. It has to have agrip on the earth so that the whole of this globe can quiver, and to do that itis necessary to carry out a very expensive construction. But I want to say thisunderground work belongs to the tower.By Mr. Hawkins:Q. Anything that was there, tell us about.A. There was, as your Honor states, a big shaft about ten by twelve feet, goesabout 120 feet and this was first covered with timber and the inside with steeland in the center of this there was a winding stairs going down and in thecenter of the stairs there was a big shaft again through which the current wasto pass, and this shaft was so figured in order to tell exactly where the nodalpoint is, so that I could calculate every point of distance. For instance Icould calculate exactly the size of the earth or the diameter of the earth andmeasure it exactly within four feet with that machine.Q. And that was a necessary appurtenance to your tower?A. Absolutely necessary. And then the real expensive work was to connect thatcentral part with the earth, and there I had special machines rigged up whichwould push the iron pipes, one length after another, and I pushed these ironpipes, I think 16 of them, 300 feet, and then the current through these pipestakes hold of the earth. Now that was a very expensive part of the work, but itdoes not show on the tower, but it belongs to the tower.….Q. Tell the Court generally, not in detail, the purpose of that tower and theequipment which you have described in connection with it?Mr. Fordham: How is that material?The Referee: I will take it.Mr. Fordham: We except.A. Well, the primary purpose of the tower, your Honor, was to telephone, to sendthe human voice and likeness around the globe.By the Referee:Q. Through the instrumentality of the earth.A. Through the instrumentality of the earth. That was my discovery that Iannounced in 1893…….By Mr. Hawkins:Q. The purpose then briefly was for wireless communications to various parts ofthe world?A. Yes and the tower was so designed that I could apply to it any amount ofpower and I was planning to give a demonstration in the transmission of powerwhich I have so perfected that power can be transmitted clear across the globewith a loss of not more than five per cent, and that plant was to serve as apractical demonstration….271 [4372.xhtml#3872]Now look what we have:1. At the same approximate time as Tesla is making these statements in a trial,he is making statements for the New York Times that indicate the same technologyof wireless power transmission is capable of using its longitudinal waves tomanipulate the physical medium — not just the earth — itself, either forconstructive or massively destructive purposes;2. In the transcript itself, Tesla is very careful to state that not only is hissystem for communications purposes, but for the express purpose of thetransmission of power in any amount;3. To do this, Tesla also clearly states in the transcripts that the Towerstructure at Wardenclyffe also had a deep shaft so that his system couldphysically and electrically “grip the earth” and “grip the entire globe” andmake it “quiver”; and to do this,4. Tesla also clearly implied that it was necessary to have as exact ameasurement of the earth’s size, of its geometry, as possible.272[4372.xhtml#3874] In other words, the geometrical and non-linear properties ofthe earth itself were essential components to the system.The reason it was essential may be recalled from our previous remarks withrespect to Dr. Harmut Müller’s Global Scaling Theory, namely, that longitudinalpressure waves in the medium itself are responsible for the local warping ofspace-time and the clustering of objects near certain nodal points where suchwaves overlap. To put it differently, large masses such as planets or stars arethe natural and most efficient resonators of these waves:(This) scalar coupling of the solar system provides a major check onunrestricted use of … large…strategic scalar EM weapon systems. If significantscalar effects are produced on earth in a “pulse” mode, pulsed disturbance ofthe earth-sun and earth-moon system results. Here a danger exists that one ormore natural resonances of the coupled systems may be excited. If the feedbackstimulation of the Sun is not insignificant, for example, large sunspot activitymay result sometime thereafter, say in a day or two. If too much or too sharpstimulation occurs on earth, the coupled resonant response from the sun could bedisastrous….Accordingly, use of huge scalar (electromagnetic) weapons is a double-edgedsword. Unless carefully employed, use of the weapons could cause a terriblebacklash to the user as well as the victim, and even accidentally cause thedestruction of the earth itself.273 [4372.xhtml#3876]In other words, precise knowledge of local celestial geometries, including theearth, is at all times essential in such a system as Tesla envisioned, and thisis, perhaps, why he himself ultimately described the implications of histechnology for a deeper physics able to engineer the physical medium itselfdestructively or constructively. And note, in Tesla’s vision, it was quiteessential that the system itself be physically and electrically rooted to theearth, for the earth indeed was a huge component in a gigantic electricalcircuit. Thus, they do greatly err who would maintain that such a system wouldmore practically be deployable on satellites in space, for the whole point ofsuch longitudinal waves of stress in the medium itself is that they are bestestablished by manipulating their natural resonators: whole planets and stars.To say otherwise is entirely to misunderstand the physics.274 [4372.xhtml#3878]The best place for the deployment of such systems is precisely on the surface ofplanets."},{"pageContent":"C. CONCLUSIONSSo at the end of this journey, we have the following things:1. There clearly exists a physics of open systems in which ever-changingcelestial geometries exercise mutual physical influences;2. This physics points to a deeper physics of the physical medium itself, whichis manipulable via longitudinal waves of stress within the medium, which in turnmay be accessible via methods of electrical stress in nonlinear mediums such asthe earth, or, in the case of stars, rotating plasmas;3. This physics and the ability to incorporate whole planets as components of atechnology clearly existed, and was asserted, as early as the turn of the lastcentury, in the work and words of Nikola Tesla, who noted both its benign andmalign implications were both logical and simultaneous entailments of that samephysics and system of technology;4. As the database of physical science expands with increasing measurements overa vast and disparate body of knowledge, correlations between seemingly unrelatedsystems began to be noticed, and these correlations included cycles of humaneconomic, sociological, and emotional activity, suggesting the possibility of adeep correlation between physics, economics, and celestial geometries;5. Significant indicators were also found of discrete but definitive corporateand financial interest in the discovery of the principles of these connectionsbetween physics and economics, and in the case of Tesla and Morgan, of effortsto privately develop and later suppress its instrumentalities.It is in those last two points — the deep correlation between physics,economics, and celestial geometries, and the private development and suppressionof its instrumentalities — that we discover a host of questions, and a veryancient, indeed, “paleoancient” connection…."},{"pageContent":"II.THE TEMPLES, THE STARS, AND THE BANKSTERS“…so it was that the temple that should owe fealty to the gods alone, became afront for the international money creative force of that day and age; connectedclosely with the trade in precious metals and slaves as it must have been.”— David Astle, The Babylonian Woe, p. 25."},{"pageContent":"FourTEMPLES, TEMPLATES, AND TRUSTSTHE ANCIENT ROOTS OF A DEEP RELATIONSHIP[5712.jpeg]“The determination of the stars to which some of the Egyptian temples, sacred toa known divinity, were directed, opened a way, as I anticipated, to a study ofthe astronomical basis of parts of the mythology.”— J. Norman Lockyear275 [4372.xhtml#3900]“…to put it in the terse language of Bastiat, society implies exchange, andexchange, money.”— Alexander Del Mar276 [4372.xhtml#3902]Paradoxically, the farther back in history one goes, the closer the relationshipbetween science, magic, and money becomes. Many have commented upon thisrelationship, but few have understood its significance for the type of physicsthat it implies. The nature of this relationship, and the conspiratorialimplications that it implies, is best exhibited by examining the relationship ofgold mining and slavery in ancient Egypt. But it is important to begin at thebeginning, in order to see how, and in what manner, the actions of a conspiracycan be glimpsed. From earliest times, the power to “make and issue money andregulate the value thereof ” (to paraphrase the U.S. Constitution) has beenrecognized to be the sole prerogative of the State, or, in more ancient times,the crown or king.As the famous nineteenth-century American numismatic scholar Alexander Del Maraptly put it, “The right to coin money has always been and still remains thesurest mark and announcement of sovereignty.”277 [4372.xhtml#3904] Indeed, it isbecause it is a sure “mark and announcement of sovereignty” that one finds theassociation of the making and regulation of the legal value of money sointertwined not only with the sovereignty of the state or crown, but with thesovereignty of God (or, as the case may be, of the gods) from whom the power ofrule in most ancient societies was invariably perceived to derive, and no betterexemplar of this complex relationship between the state control of moneyissuance, of mining, and the close interlock of both with religion can be foundthan that of ancient Republican and Imperial Rome."},{"pageContent":"A. TEMPLES AND TRUSTS"},{"pageContent":"1. The Roman ModelAs money in ancient times was primarily — though certainly not exclusively —thought to reside in precious metals such as gold, copper, silver, and in somecases even bronze, it inevitably followed that for a state to maintain itssovereignty over the making, issuance, and regulation of the value of money, ithad to exercise a strict control over the mining of those metals:Therefore, the means necessary to secure and maintain such a money were for theState to monopolize the copper mines, restrict the commerce in copper, strikecopper pieces of high artistic merit, in order to defeat counterfeiting, stampthem with the mark of the State, render them the sole legal tenders for thepayment of domestic contracts, taxes, fines, and debts, limit their emissionuntil their value (from universal demand for them and their comparativescarcity) rose to more than that of the metal of which they were composed, andmaintain such restriction and over-valuation as the permanent policy of theState. For foreign trade or diplomacy a supply of gold and silver, coined anduncoined, could be kept in the treasury.There are ample evidences that means of this character were, in fact, employedby the Roman Republic; and, therefore, that such was the system of money itadopted. The copper mines were monopolized by the Roman State, the commerce incopper was regulated, the bronze nummi were issued by the State, which strictlymonopolized their fabrication, and the designs were of great beauty, the pieceswere stamped “S.C.,” or ex senates consulta….their emission was limited, untilthe value of the pieces rose to about five times that of the metal theycontained, and they steadily and for a lengthy period retained this highover-valuation.278 [4372.xhtml#3906]Thus, we have three interconnected ideas at the outset:1. The power to coin and regulate the value of money by established law was aprerogative solely of the state or crown, and not of any private money- orcredit-issuing monopoly;2. There was no inherent value in “precious metals” as such, but such value hadto be artificially created by the state issuing such money by two means:a. the relative scarcity of precious metal money issued, which made the legalmonetary value of money issued exceed the inherent value of the metal in thecoin itself; and,b. the value was further enhanced by the creation or addition of artwork to thecoins issued; and,3. Because the issuance of money was connected to precious metals such ascopper, silver, and gold, the state or crown had to maintain a monopoly over themining and stockpiling of such metals.a. The Bullion Trust and the TempleBut in ancient Rome, there is a further factor at work, and it is best to allowDel Mar himself to state what it is: “It is impossible to resist theconviction,” he states, “that the superior value of gold in the West was createdby means of legal and, perhaps, also sacerdotal ordinances. This method offixing the ratio may even have originated in the Orient.”279 [4372.xhtml#3908]In other words, in fixing the value of gold at a ratio of certain units of value— expressed in terms of other metals — per unit of gold, gold’s value as theultimate precious metal was established largely through religious ordinances.Moreover, Del Mar suggests this practice originated in “the Orient,” which couldmean, as far as Rome was concerned, the Middle East or even the East as far awayas India. So one now must add, to the above list, a fourth connection:4) The value of gold was fixed largely by “sacerdotal ordinance,” in otherwords, there is a deep and profound connection between the issuance of money,its fixation of value in law in terms of precious metals whose value in turn isdefined by ratios per unit of gold on the one hand, and religion on the other.In short, one is in the presence of the deep connection of ancient conceptionsof money, and religion, or as I put it in the chapter title, between “temples”and “trusts.”But why call such a relationship, on the monetary side of things, a trust atall?Del Mar provides a significant clue in a statement that, on first glance, seemsto evidence nothing more than a difference in monetary and metals policies onthe part of Occidental and Oriental societies. He states that “The governmentsof Persia, Assyria, Egypt, Greece and Rome made a profit on the coinage byraising the value of gold, while those of India, China, and perhaps also Japan,made their profit by maintaining, or enhancing, the value of silver.”280[4372.xhtml#3910] In other words, for the societies of the Occident — Egypt,Assyria (and presumably Babylon), Persia, Greece, and Rome — artificiallydefined gold as being the metal of highest value in terms of its convertibilityinto more units of other metals, while, conversely, the governments of theOrient — India and China — pursued the reverse policy, of making silver thehighest valued metal in terms of its convertibility into other metals. Thus,trade could be carried out between these two disparate parts of the world; thepolicies were in a certain sense an inevitable consequence of that trade.However, a closer examination reveals a hidden player, for such trade willinevitably create the rise of an international trading class, one which,moreover, will create its wealth precisely by trade in these precious metals,metals that are easier to transport than finished goods, and which can beexchanged in any place for such goods. In short, what is being created, fromearliest times, is an international financial class of “bullion brokers,” or aswe would call them now, bankers. A significant question now occurs: Is itpossible that, rather than such a class having emerged as a consequence of suchgovernmental policies and trade, that the converse is true? Is it possible thatthere existed such a class of “international bullion brokers” who created thesepolicies in various parts of the world, policies which would enhance their ownpower and wealth? If so, then how did they achieve and orchestrate this?The answer to that question will consume us in the remaining chapters of thisbook, but in order to answer it, we must once again turn to the unusual fixationof the value of gold and silver in the Occidental cultures: Greece, Egypt, theMesopotamian civilizations, and Rome. Why was gold — which was much easier andless costly to mine than silver — valued more highly than silver?Del Mar has already suggested the answer; it was because in some measure, goldwas regarded as sacred, as being under the special jurisdiction of the gods:The sacerdotal character conferred upon gold, or the coinage of gold, was not anovelty of the Julian constitution (of Rome); rather was it an ancient myth putto new political use…A similar belief is to be noticed among the ancient Greeks,whose coinages, except during the republican era, were conducted in the templesand under the supervision of priests. Upon these issues were stamped thesymbolism and religion of the State, and as only the priesthood could correctlyillustrate these mysteries of their own creation, the coinage — at least that ofthe more precious pieces — naturally became a prerogative of their order.281[4372.xhtml#3912]But this raises as many questions as it resolves. For example, Del Mar hasclearly indicated that the prerogative of the issuance of money and theregulation of its value was seen by ancient societies to reside clearly with thestate or crown. Yet, he has now admitted that insofar as one precious metal wasconcerned, the issuance of money in connection with it was less a prerogative ofthe state or crown than it was of a religious monopoly.Additionally, it has already been suggested that the differences in monetarypolicies between the Occident and Orient could serve in the long run not only tocontribute to the rise of an “international class of bullion brokers,” but alsothat the creation of such policies might even be due to the preexistence of thatclass, its international extent, and its ability to manipulate the respectivepolicies of Occidental and Oriental governments. And insofar as that ability tomanipulate their respective policies is concerned, when it comes to the highsacredness of gold, at least within Occidental cultures, this implies also theability to manipulate their religions. Succinctly stated: the bullion trust andthe temple are at the minimum allies, and at the maximum, the one hasinfiltrated and taken over the other. Or in Del Mar’s apt observation, one nowseen to be pregnant with meaning and significance just beneath its surface, thesacredness of gold “was an ancient myth put to new political use.”282[4372.xhtml#3914]b. A Fascinating Tangent: Byzantium, Religion, and the Money PowerA fascinating glimpse into the strength of this association between themoney-issuing prerogative of the state or crown on the one hand, and religion onthe other, is afforded by the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire, whose power andinfluence throughout Christian Europe during the Middle Ages extended far beyondits ever-shifting borders. That power and influence was due precisely because ofthe strength of this relationship, and its hold over the cultural imagination ofthe Christian Middle Ages, because for all their claimed “divine prerogatives,”not even the Roman popes understood their power to include the ability to makeand issue money and regulate its value. That prerogative was understood toreside still with the Roman emperor in Constantinople. Noting that the very“moment when these people became Christians, or were conquered or brought underthe control of the Roman hierarchy, their gold mines began to be abandoned andclosed.”283 [4372.xhtml#3916] Various numismatic scholars had long profferedvarious unsatisfactory explanations. But, states Del Mar,All such futile explanations are effectually answered by the common use ofByzantine gold coins throughout Christendom. In England, for example, theexchequer rolls relating to the mediaeval ages, collated by Madox, prove thatpayments in gold besants284 [4372.xhtml#3918] were made every day, and that goldcoins, as compared with silver ones, were as common then as now. If metal hadbeen wanted for making English gold coins, it was to be had in sufficiency andat once. All that was necessary was to throw the besants into the Englishmelting-pot. As for the feeble suggestion that for five hundred years noChristian princes wished to coin gold so long as the Basileus285[4372.xhtml#3920] was willing to coin for them, when the coinage of gold was theuniversally recognized mark of sovereignty, and when, also, the profit… was onehundred per cent, it is scarcely worth answering….The true reason why gold money was always used but never coined by the princesof the mediaeval empire relates… to that hierarchical constitution of paganRome, which afterwards with modifications became the constitution of ChristianRome. Under this constitution, and from the epoch of Julius to that of Alexis,the mining and coinage of gold was a prerogative attached to the office of thesovereign-pontiff, and was, therefore, an article of the Roman constitution andof the Roman religion.286 [4372.xhtml#3922]Thus, as Del Mar notes, prior to the Latin Crusade which attacked andsuccessfully occupied Constantinople in 1204, no Christian prince in Europedared coin his own gold coins prior to that event, but after it, all of themdid.287 [4372.xhtml#3924] And thus, the hidden motivation for the attack of theChristian West on the Christian East in 1204 is revealed: it was to acquire thelegal authority, under the Roman constitution, to make and coin gold money.Thereafter, the money-issuing prerogative devolved to the lesser crowned headsof Europe. Prior to that point, however, it would have been sacrilege to givecurrency to any other (gold coinage); hence no other Christian prince, not eventhe pope of Rome, nor the sovereign of the Western or Mediaeval ‘empire,’attempted to coin gold while the ancient Empire survived.”288 [4372.xhtml#3926]Such monies were, quite literally, viewed as “heretical money.”289[4372.xhtml#3928]Hence, we have yet another possible explanation for the preoccupation of thecrowned heads of mediaeval Western Europe with alchemy during the MiddleAges.290 [4372.xhtml#3930] Alchemy’s claim was, of course, to be able to takebase metals and transform them into gold. Thus, by taking imitation coins of thegold besant, coins that could not be deemed counterfeit, since they were notcirculated nor coined by anyone in gold, and transmuting them into gold, analchemical end run around Byzantium’s money monopoly could be achieved."},{"pageContent":"2. The Egyptian Model: Mining, Slavery, Mercenaries, and Implicationsa. Nubia and EgyptThe connections thus far exhibited between the money-coining prerogative of thestate, the international “bullion brokers’ trust,” the temple, and now alchemy,leads one inexorably further back into history, and to the even tighterrelationships between them that are exhibited in Egypt. It is here that onebegins to see more clearly the sinister outlines of that international bullionbrokers’ trust emerging, and of its deep relationship not only to the temple,but to the deeper physics that the temple, and money, portended. Egypt is alsosignificant for another reason, as we shall see, in that it is a symbol of therelationship of the bullion trust to the temple, a relationship that also occursin other states and civilizations of the period.Egypt was probably the largest gold-mining and producing state in the ancientworld. The reason is simple: the Nile. As Alexander Del Mar puts it, “Gold hasbeen found in nearly every region tributary to the Nile, from the Equator to theFirst Cataract.”291 [4372.xhtml#3932] But no region was more connected to goldmining than was the region of Nubia, bordering modern-day southern Egypt and theSudan. The term Nubia itself “appears to have originated in Egypt, where Nob orNub signifies gold, hence Nubia, the land of gold.”292 [4372.xhtml#3934] Beneaththe foothills of Nubia lies a vast gravel-and-sand expanse of desert, washedduring the flood season by numerous streams and gullies. This region is known asthe Bisharee or Bishara, the Great Nubian Desert.293 [4372.xhtml#3936] Del Marnotes thatNext to the mines of the Altai mountains of India, the Bisharee mines of Egyptare probably the oldest in the world; and in view of the Indian origin of theEgyptians, and the distant researches and conquests which have been made by theleading nations for the acquisition of gold, it seems not at all improbable thatthere existed a close connection between the discovery of the Egyptian mines andthe original settlement of the country by Asiatic races.294 [4372.xhtml#3938]So rich were the Bisharee mines in antiquity that it is worth having a closerlook at them, for it is in that closer look that we shall discern a patternbeginning to emerge.b. Quartz, Gold, and SlaveryThe Bisharee mines, as noted above, are among the oldest known in antiquity, andsome of the most extensive. Additionally, the fields, like many gold mines, arealso known for their abundant deposits of quartz:If conjecture be admitted where dates are… confused, it appears likely that theBisharee mines were worked as early as the era of Menes, which is variouslyassigned to from twenty-nine to thirty-nine centuries B.C.; for in the time ofthat monarch or lawgiver, the Nile was diked, and from the character of thisriver and its surroundings there could have been no necessity to dike it untilmining had surcharged its waters with sediment.The supposed antiquity of these mines derives support from the fact that even atthe period of Menes gold had been used for money in India; that Menes was anIndian conqueror and lawgiver; that the Indian Code of Manou, still extant, andassigned variously to from the fifteenth to the thirty-first century B.C., isevidently re-compiled from a much-older code, now lost; that commerce betweenIndia and Egypt existed from the remotest times mentioned in history or derivedfrom archaeological remains; that an Egyptian expedition to India is attributedto Sesostris, B.C. 2000, and from other considerations.However this may be, the Bisharee mines are known to have been worked for quartzso long ago as the twelfth dynasty, which Lepsius assigns to the period B.C.2830. From the fact, understood by every miner, that quartz is never worked solong as the placers contain the smallest practical quantity of metal, andjudging from the experience of Italy, Spain, and Brazil — where extensive placerdeposits were worked, as in Egypt, by the hand labour of slaves — the Bishareeplaces mines were at least two hundred years old when the quartz was workedunder the twelfth dynasty of the Pharaohs.295 [4372.xhtml#3940]Note the presence of two new factors that will loom larger and larger as weproceed: first, the presence of precious or semi-precious stones, in this case,quartz, and the working of such mines by slaves.c. Diodorus Siculus and the Bishara MinesIt is the presence of slaves at the Bisharee mines that affords us our firstsignificant clue into the minds and mentality of the ancient bullion brokers,and why they and their activities were so often associated with temples. Itrequires a closer look, which is afforded by the classical writer DiodorusSiculus. Del Mar notes that Diodorus visited the mines in 50 B.C. After thevisit, he recorded his impressions of the mines:On the confines of Egypt and the neighbouring countries there are regions fullof gold mines, whence, with the costs and pains of many labourers, much gold isdug. The soil is naturally black, but in the body of the earth there are manyveins of shining white quartz, glit-tering will all sorts of bright metals, outof which those appointed to be overseers cause the gold to be dug by the labourof a vast multitude of people. For the kings of Egypt condemn to these mines notonly notorious criminals, captives taken in war, persons accused of falsedealings, and those with whom the kind is offended, but also all the kindred andrelatives of the latter. These are sent to this work, either as a punishment, orthat the profit and gain of the king may be increased by their labours.There are thus infinite numbers thrown into these mines, all bound in fetters,kept at work night and day, and so strictly surrounded that there is nopossibility of their effecting an escape. They are guarded by mercenary soldiersof various barbarous nations, whose language is foreign to them and to eachother, so that there are no means either of forming conspiracies or ofcorrupting those who are set to watch them. They are kept to incessant work bythe rod of the overseer, who often lashes them severely. Not the least care istaken of the bodies of these poor creatures; they have not a rag to cover theirnakedness; and whoever sees them must compassionate their melancholy anddeplorable condition, for though they may be sick or maimed or lame, no rest norany intermission of labour is allowed them. Neither the weakness of old age, northe infirmities of females, excuse any from the work, to which all are driven byblows and cudgels; until, borne down by the intolerable weight of their misery,many fall dead in the midst of their insufferable labours. Deprived of all hope,these miserable creatures expect each day to be worse than the last, and longfor death to end their griefs.296 [4372.xhtml#3942]While the passage is one to move any decent human being to compassion and pityfor the poor wretches condemned to work the mines, there are two things thatshould be noted.First, given the antiquity of the mines of Bisharee and the stability ofEgyptian society and culture, it is reasonable to assume that the conditions atthe mines had not changed throughout the several centuries that they wereworked. Thus, secondly, the presence of an international contingent of mercenaryguards of the mines might well be a practice dating back for centuries. Thereasons for such an international contingent Diodorus makes clear: it was todeny the condemned any opportunity of bribing a sufficient contingent of guardsto effect an escape.But mercenaries might signal something else, and that is a certain collusionbetween the Egyptian kings and those able to supply such a large and disparategroup of mercenaries. To put it succinctly, the mercenary guard contingentsubtly implies the existence of an international money power. But implication isnot yet proof.d. Money, Kings, Temples and CounterfeitersThere is, however, another indication that something more than mere coincidenceis involved in the use of mercenaries at the Bisharee mines. Another clue liesin the widespread association of ancient temples with the issuance of preciousmetal monies:The archaic Chinese and Indian, as well as the early Greek coins, were oftenmarked with emblems, which in the former cases are supposed to be, and in thelatter case are known to be, religious. The mints were in the temples, and thepriests monopolized, or tried to monopolize, the secrets of metallurgy. Thiscustom may have arisen either from the cupidity of the priesthood to reap theprofits of coinage, or solicitude on the part of the sovereign to preventcounterfeiting or to render it the more heinous.297 [4372.xhtml#3944]This fact, plus the fact of international contingents of mercenaries atBisharee, has now amassed a significant series of questions:1. Why were ancient mints in temples, especially if, as Del Mar has conceded andas we have already examined, the prerogative of money issuance and valueregulation was solely a state or crown prerogative? Part of the answer, ofcourse, lies in the fact that in most ancient cultures, particularly those ofthe Middle East, the King was in fact also the chief or high priest, and thepriesthood itself often fulfilled the function of the state bureaucracy.Nonetheless the question remains, why associate money issuance with temples?2. The widespread practice of this association in such disparate cultures asChina, India, and Greece, itself must be explained. Does it lie, once again,merely in the close association of the crown prerogative with the priesthood inancient societies, or is there something else involved, something perhapssignaled by the presence of international mercenary contingents at Bisharee?We have already suggested that the peculiar policies of Rome vis-à-vis theOrient in the regulation of gold and silver valuation suggested a certain amountof collusion between the states so affected, a collusion suggesting aninternational coordination of such policies. Now, we find at the Bisharee minesyet another suggestion of such international collusion in the presence ofmercenaries from various cultures. The question is, then, who is doing it, andwhy?Part of the answer is suggested by a passing observation made by Del Mar:The Egyptians… possessing the most extensive and productive gold mines which areknown to have been worked at any certain period of antiquity…furnished to othernations, including the Indians, the material out of which they too could makemoney.298 [4372.xhtml#3946]This is the surest testament of the fact that we are now in the presence of aninternational bullion brokers’ conspiracy, for why would India need Egyptiangold to issue money? Why could the Indian kings and princes not have issued someother money based on some other commodity which it had in abundance, and requireits acceptance by law? Such was their prerogative. So why rely on imports ofgold? The argument that an internationally recognized medium of exchange wasneeded falls to the ground, for as already noted, India and China preferredduring the Roman era to value silver higher than gold, while the Occidentpreferred the reverse. Moreover, by diplomatic agreement and treaty, othermechanisms of exchange could have been agreed upon by various heads of state.In any case, we now have assembled three discrete types of evidence that pointto the possible existence of an international money power, or “bullion brokers”as we have called them, in ancient times:1. The unusual bullion policies of Rome vis-à-vis the Orient, which policieswere virtual opposites of each other with respect to the relative valuation ofsilver and gold bullion. Such reciprocal policies could, of course, highlybenefit an international money power with bases of operations in both places,for by transferring gold to the east and converting it to silver, and reapingthe fees thereof, and then silver to the west and converting again to gold, vastprofits could be accumulated;2. The almost universal association of temples with minting, from the MiddleEast to China and India; and,3. The presence of an international contingent of mercenaries from variouscountries and states at one of antiquity’s largest gold mines at Bisharee, mineswhich in turn are worked by slaves and prisoners of war.There is, however, a distinctly different association of temples in ancienttimes, besides that of minting and money issuance…"},{"pageContent":"B. TEMPLES AND TEMPLATES: ASTRONOMY, ASTROLOGY, AND THE ALCHEMY OF MONEY"},{"pageContent":"1. The Temples and the Stars…that association is with time and its measurement, in short, with astrology andastronomy.Today, of course, it is widely accepted that ancient temples and megalithicsites were oriented to this or that astronomical event or alignment: thesolstices, the precession of the equinoxes, and so on. Societies andcivilizations such as Sumer and Babylonia were well-known for their strongastronomical and astrological skills, having left literally thousands of claytablets recording their observations. But until comparatively recently in thenineteenth century, Egypt was the exception to this rule, until a Britishastronomer, J. Norman Lockyear, demonstrated that the same held true for Egypt’stemples as well, and from the most ancient times. Lockyear’s book The Dawn ofAstronomy: A Study of Temple Worship and Mythology of the Ancient Egyptiansbegan a cycle that continues to this day, with alternative Egyptologists such asAndrew Collins, Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval demonstrating the astronomicallayouts and alignments of the site most people associate with ancient Egypt: thepyramids and temples of Giza. One might thus well view Lockyear as one of thefirst modern “paleophysicists,” i.e., a modern scientist looking at ancientmyths seriously, and attempting to reconstruct from them an underlyingscientific basis.299 [4372.xhtml#3948]Lockyear notes that ancient civilizations’ astronomical and astrological recordsgo back almost to the very edges of known antiquity:We go back in Egypt for a period, as estimated by various authors, of somethinglike 6,000 or 7,000 years. In Babylonia inscribed tablets carry us into the dimpast for a period of certainly 5,000 years; but the so-called “omen” tabletsindicate that observations of eclipses and other astronomical phenomena had beenmade for some thousands of years before this period. In China and India we goback as certainly to more than 4,000 years ago.300 [4372.xhtml#3950]Indeed, in Babylon’s case, if one is to take the assertions of the “omentablets” seriously, these observations comprised a database assiduously compiledfor hundreds of thousands of years!301 [4372.xhtml#3952]Decoding the association of various Egyptian temples to various gods, and theassociation of the latter in turn with various celestial bodies, Lockyear stateshis main thesis toward the end of his book, calling it his “working hypothesis”:1. The first civilisation as yet glimpsed, so far as temple building goes, inNorthern Egypt, represented by that at Annu or Heliopolis, was a civilisationwith a non-equinoctial solar worship, combined with the cult of a northern star.2. Memphis (possibly also Sais, Bubastis, Tanis and other cities with east andwest walls) and the great pyramids were built by a new invading race,representing an advance in astronomical thought. The northern stars wereworshipped possibly on the meridian, and a star rising in the east wasworshipped at each equinox.3. The subsequent blank in Egyptian history was associated with conflictsbetween these and other races; which were ended by the victory of therepresentatives of the old worship of Annu, reinforced from the south, as ifnorth-star and south-star cults had combined against the equinoctial cult.After these conflicts, east and west pyramid building practically ceased,Memphis takes second place, and Thebes, a southern Annu, so far as the form ofsolar worship and the cult of Sit are concerned, comes upon the scene as theseat of the twelfth dynasty.4. The subsequent historical events were largely due to conflicts with intrudingraces from the north-east. The intruders established themselves in cities witheast and west walls, and were on each occasion driven out by solstitialworshippers who founded dynasties (eighteenth and twenty-fifth) at Thebes.302[4372.xhtml#3954]We shall not concern ourselves with the lengthy arguments that Lockyearpresented in order to arrive at these conclusions, but note only that thevarious conflicts in Egypt — given Lockyear’s astronomical premise for templeorientation — were in a certain sense as much about physics as they were aboutreligion. Given the fact that Babylonian temples were well known to beassociated with various deities and celestial bodies, and that Egypt’sdemonstrably were as well, as Lockyear argued, we now note the peculiar factthat temples, for a reason as yet unknown, were closely associated both withcelestial alignments and the minting and issuance of bullion-based monies.One possible reason for the association, however, is suggested by well-knownspace anomalies researcher Richard C. Hoagland. We may approach Hoagland’sremarks by noting a curious fact observed by Lockyear: “…In Lower Egypt thetemples are pointed to rising stars near the north point of the horizon orsetting north of west. In Upper Egypt we deal chiefly with temples directed tostars rising in the south-east or setting low in the south-west.”303[4372.xhtml#3956] The fact that so many ancient temples show evidence both of aprofound association with the stars through their astrological alignments, andalso of international banking through the prominent association of moneychangerswith those temples, is an indicator that at a deep and profound level — perhapsas a legacy of the Very High Civilization from which they sprang — theseclassical civilizations through their marriage of banking and astrologypreserved the dim memory of a lost science that unified physics, economics, andfinance.Hoagland made the following interesting series of observations in 1992 duringhis presentation of the Mars anomalies evidence during a briefing at the UnitedNations:Or take the Sun itself. For the last several years, scientists have been lookingfor nuclear particles supposedly coming from the center of the Sun because ofits thermonuclear reactions, a kind of ‘chained H-bomb’ model. But for the last20 years, they haven’t found anywhere near as many of these particles as modelswould predict; in fact, the Soviets and the Japanese, who have recently broughton line experiments to measure fundamental particles, have found none. Is itpossible that at the very center of our solar system, this incredible blazingball of gas, around which all the worlds in this system orbit, is in fact fueledfrom another source? …Well, this opens up remarkable possibilities which, whenwe look back at our cultures on this planet, and their attention to the Sun,others may have also noticed.When we look at the stars, at the sky at night, we’re not seeing chained andimprisoned H-bombs, we’re seeing portals to another dimension. And the portalsare glowing windows through which we can peer and glimpse the fragments of aphysics from another side. What is stunning is when you take that metaphor, andyou go back and you read the actual Egyptian descriptions in the hieroglyphs forSirius, the brightest star in the sky, the description is (that) Sirius is adoorway. Now what did they know? What did they know?Now, looking at that as a twentieth-century Egyptologist, or as a modernanthropologist, or as any of the academics looking at the history of man andarchaeology, the obvious answer is: ‘They didn’t know anything. It was allprimitive superstition.’ … (But) we can now buttress with specific mathematicallinkages, which indicate strongly (that) the Egyptians, among others, wereprofoundly aware that the night sky and all of reality is somehow circumscribedby the physics behind the circumscribed geometry given to us now by theMonuments of Mars. And that of course is an amazing statement to be able tomake.But there’s another, because the thought occurred then, after we had figuredthis part out — the potential, the possibility — that if in fact the Sun is a‘gate’ to another dimension, and (that) the energy we see is merely alower-level transformation of a higher-level force or energy or process, it maybe possible to harness such a process on earth and to create an actualhyper-dimensional technology. What could one do…?304 [4372.xhtml#3958]What, indeed, did ancient Egypt, and by implication, all other ancient cultures,with their persistent and consistent association of stars with deities or“higher intelligences” and other dimensions, know? Was there indeed a deeperphysics behind their astrological obsessions? And what could one do with thatphysics? Hoagland has also suggested something else as well, and that is thatthere is a physics connection with the ancient fixation on “sacred geometry” andthe positioning of various temples and buildings on sites that embody suchgeometries, in this case, on Mars. And why does one find moneychangersinvariably associated with these temples? One answer is hinted at by Lockyear."},{"pageContent":"2. The Peculiar Resemblance of Pantheons Between CulturesLockyear makes yet another pertinent observation relevant to our purposes. Tounderstand its significance, one need only consider the fact that if temples areassociated with various gods — whether in Egypt or Mesopotamia — and variousgods in turn are associated with various celestial bodies, then there should beconsiderable parallel between the pantheons of various civilizations, since, ina word, the underlying astronomical data are the same. This, he observes, is infact what one actually sees. There is a peculiar parallel between the Egypt godAnnu or An, and the Babylonian Anu.305 [4372.xhtml#3960] More to the point, onan astrological-astronomical reading, the gods blend into each other. Forexample, the chief god of the Mesopotamian city of Eridu was Ea, a.k.a. Enki,a.k.a. Oannes, “symbolized as a goat-fish.”306 [4372.xhtml#3962] This Ea or Enkisired a son, Tammuz, who was “in some way associated with Asari,” who, notesLockyear, has a name suspiciously similar to the Egyptian Osiris.307[4372.xhtml#3964] The god Tammuz in turn ultimately becomes the notoriouslymurderous god Nergal in Chaldaea.308 [4372.xhtml#3966] Nergal by similarastronomical conversions eventually actually becomes “the Spring Sun Marduk” ofBabylon itself.309 [4372.xhtml#3968] In other words, lurking behind all thesetransformations and pantheonic parallels is the association of Enki with Nergaland Marduk, and via Tammuz, with the Egyptian Osiris. Such pantheonic parallelsare, once again, inevitable if, as Lockyear shows, the gods themselves areassociated with various celestial bodies. The patterns of the heavens, as itwere, formed a template with which to associate certain gods and theiractivities.However, given the fact that we now have the close association of temples notonly with astronomy and astrology, but with money issuance and therefore withmining, and given the fact that we have discovered three significant indicatorsthat we may also be looking at the discrete and subtle actions of an ancientinternational “bullion brokers” power, the similarity of pantheons may haveother than just astronomical causes. It may indeed be a product of thedeliberate manipulation of those pantheons by an entity that has everyappearance of being international in extent and influence in ancient times. Butto what purpose? The answer to that question must unfortunately await the nextchapter, as there is a further association of gods, gold and temples to beexplored:"},{"pageContent":"3. Gold, Gods, and GemsThat other association is with precious and semi-precious gems. It is a peculiarfact, notes researcher George Frederick Kunz, thatFrom the earliest times in man’s history gems and precious stones have been heldin great esteem. They have been found in the monuments of prehistoric peoples,and not alone the civilization of the Pharaohs, of the Incas, or of theMontezumas invested these brilliant things from Nature’s jewel casket with asignificance beyond the mere suggestion of their intrinsic properties.310[4372.xhtml#3970]But why give such items a significance beyond “their intrinsic properties”? Oneanswer might lie in their well-known association with astrology from ancienttimes:The magi, the wise men, the seers, the astrologers of the ages gone by foundmuch in the matter of gems that we have nearly come to forgetting. With themeach gem possessed certain planetary attractions peculiar to itself, certainaffinities with the various virtues, and a zodiacal concordance with the seasonsof the year. Moreover, these early sages were firm believers in the influence ofgems in one’s nativity — that the evil in the world could be kept fromcontaminating a child properly protected by wearing the appropriate talismanic,natal, and zodiacal gems.311 [4372.xhtml#3972]That is to say, gems, since they were associated with certain celestialalignments, planetary bodies, and houses of the zodiac, could quite literally,on the ancient view, draw down (or ward off!) the influences of those bodies andalignments. But why did such a belief originate? What is its underlying cause?Search as one might for the answer to those questions amid ancient texts andtomes,312 [4372.xhtml#3974] one always comes up empty-handed, being met with thebare and naked assertion that it is so, with perhaps now and then an attempt —usually unconvincing — as to why it is so. Kunz even notes that during theRenaissance “an effort was made to find a reason of some sort for thetraditional beliefs.”313 [4372.xhtml#3976] Nor is he above suggesting thateventually, science itself might suggest the reasons, or rather, re-discoverthem.314 [4372.xhtml#3978]a. The Traditional Powers Associated with GemsLeaving aside the speculative scientific case for this association to a laterchapter, we shall catalogue here but a few of their alleged powers and virtuesattributed to them by ancient lore. One almost universal property attributed tothem is the ability to heal various maladies and infirmities .315[4372.xhtml#3980] Oftentimes these were associated specifically to their variouscolors and relative luminescence.316 [4372.xhtml#3982] In one case, a Hindutradition even describes diamonds as “Indra’s weapon.”317 [4372.xhtml#3984]There are, in the Sumerian tradition, stones of “love” and “hate,” or, as theSumerian literally has it, “un-love.”318 [4372.xhtml#3986] And as readers of mybook The Cosmic War know, one Sumerian epic, The Epic of Ninurta, is nothing buta rather dull inventory-taking of some extraordinary stones that were capturedafter a gruesome war, shades of the imaginary scenario with which we began thisbook!319 [4372.xhtml#3988]And there are even some rather special cases of powers attributed to gemstonesthat merit closer attention.(1) Special Case Number One: InvisibilityKuns cites a passage from the 1659 treastise “The Faithful Lapidary” by ThomasNicols that is worth mentioning here. Nicols begins by enumerating a typicallist of the reputed and assumed powers of precious gems:Perfectionem effectus contineri in causa. But it cannot truly be so spoken ofgemms [sic] and pretious [sic] stones, the effects of which, by Lapirists aresaid to be, the making of men rich and eloquent, to preserve men from thunderand lightning, from plagues and diseases, to move dreams, to procure sleep, toforetell things to come, to make men wise, to strengthen memory, to procurehonours, to hinder fascinations and witchcrafts, to hinder slothfulness, to putcourage into men, to keep men chaste, to increase friendship, to hinderdifference and dissention…This is a fairly standard list, and one can even understand the attribution ofthe power “to foretell things to come” to stones, for given their astrologicalassociations, it stands to reason that the predictive properties of astrologyshould be associated with gemstones. But then comes a rather unusual statement:… and to make men invisible, as is … affirmed by Albertus and others… and manyother strange things are affirmed of them and ascribed to them, which arecontrary to the natures of gemms.320 [4372.xhtml#3990]One wonders just what other “strange things” could possibly be attributed to thepowers of gemstones beyond conferring invisibility!The belief that some stones could confer invisibility was echoed by afourteenth-century alchemist, Pierre de Boniface, who claimed that diamondscould make the wearer invisible.321 [4372.xhtml#3992] Given that an alchemist ismaking these claims, one might be justified in drawing the speculativeconclusion that this operation could only occur at certain times and undercertain conditions, given the well-established fact that most alchemists claimedtheir operations had to be performed at certain times in order for them to work.(2) Special Case Number Two: Magnetic Levitation, or Anti-GravityAn even more stunning claim is made in a Viennese print of 1709 and anaccompanying text of Valentini, “Museum museorum oder die vollständigeSchau-Bühne,” an obscure manuscript published in Frankfurt-am-Main in 1714:According to the text accompanying a curious print published in Vienna in 1709,the attractive qualities of the so-called coral-agate were to be utilized in anair ship, the invention of a Brazilian priest. Over the head of the aviator, ashe sat in the air-ship, there was a network of iron to which large coral-agateswere attached. These were expected to help in drawing up the ship, when, throughthe heat of the sun’s rays, the stones had acquired magnetic power. The mainlifting force was provided by powerful magnets enclosed in two metal spheres;how the magnets themselves were to be raised is not explained.322[4372.xhtml#3994]Here it is evident that, for whatever obscure reason, coral-agate was thought tosomehow amplify the effects of magnets in conjunction with exposure to the raysof the sun!(3) Special Case Number Three: Light-Absorbing and Emitting StonesA much more serious special case is mentioned by Kunz in connection with thepeculiar properties of Brazilian diamonds:The power of absorbing sunlight or artificial light and then giving it off inthe dark is only possessed by certain diamonds. These are Brazilian stones,slightly milky in tint, or blue-white as they are often termed, and it is anincluded substance and not the diamond itself giving it out. Willemite, kunzite,sphalerite (sulphide of zinc) and some other minerals possess the same power.Their peculiar property may be due to the presence of a slight quantity ofmanganese or to that of some of the uranium salts. That it is only theultra-violet rays that are thus absorbed by these diamonds is proved by the factthat the phenomenon is not observable when a thin plate of glass is interposedbetween the sunlight of artificial light and the diamond, as glass is nottraversed by these rays….On the other hand all diamonds phosphoresce when exposed to the rays of radium,polonium, or actinium, even when glass is interposed. Treating of some of theaspects of phosphorescence in diamonds, Sir William Crookes says:“In a vacuum, exposed to a high-tension current of electricity, diamondsphosphoresce of different colours, most South African diamonds shining with abluish light. Diamonds from other localities emit bright blue, apricot, paleblue, red, yellowish-green, orange, and pale green light. The mostphosphorescent diamonds are those which are fluorescent in the sun. Onebeautiful green diamond in my collection, when phosphorescing in a good vacuum,gives almost as much light as a candle, and you can easily read by its rays. Butthe time has hardly come when diamonds can be used as domestic illuminants!”323[4372.xhtml#3996]This is a rather interesting comment by Crookes, for archaeologists have longpuzzled how the ancient Egyptians managed to see inside their temples. If onegrants the proposition that they may have known of and used electricity or othersources of phosphorescence, then might they perhaps have discovered this qualityof diamonds or other stones?In answer to this question, Kunz makes an interesting observation:An old treatise in Greek, said in its title to come from “the sanctuary of thetemple,” and containing material, partly of Egyptian origin, may help us tounderstand something of the processes employed by a temple priest to impress thecommon people by the sight of luminous gems. The writer of the treatise declaresthat for the production of “the carbuncle that shines in the night” use was madeof certain parts (he says “the bile”) of marine animals whose entrails, scalesand bones exhibited the phenomenon of phosphorescence. If properly treated,precious stones (preferably carbuncles) would glow so brightly at night “thatanyone owning such a stone could read or write by its light as well as he couldby daylight.”324 [4372.xhtml#3998]Note that the source for this assertion comes from ancient Greek alchemicaltexts. And alchemy is, of course, invariably associated with Egypt and itstemples. We may reasonably assume, then, that such properties, if known to theancient Egyptian temple priesthoods, were among their most closely guardedsecrets.b. Gemstones, the Zodiac, and the Hebrew High-Priest’s Ephod, or BreastplatePerhaps the most familiar association of precious gemstones with the temple andreligion in Western culture is the breastplate, or ephod, of the Hebrew highpriests described in the Old Testament of the Bible, so it is worth pausing,before concluding this chapter, to take stock of the various associations of thebreastplate in Jewish lore. Kunz observes that in Rabbinical legend “it isrelated that four precious stones were given by God to King Solomon; one ofthese was the emerald. The possession of the four stones is said to have endowedthe wise king with power over all creation.”325 [4372.xhtml#4000] This is arather breathtaking claim for the power of these stones, whatever else they werein addition to the emerald.In my book The Cosmic War I noted that similar claims were made for the Sumerian“Tablets of Destiny,” stones which allegedly conferred “all the power of theuniverse” on their possessors, making them a technology highly prized — andfought over — by the various Sumerian gods.326 [4372.xhtml#4002] Here weencounter a similar claim, from a much later period, and in a different culture.Solomon, of course, is known not only for his legendary wisdom and wealth, butis also associated with the building of a magnificent temple.It is possible, if such stones existed, that the celebrated Hebrew king worethem in a royal version of the priestly breastplate or ephod, for there do existAssyrian versions of the breastplate, composed of seven gems — one for each ofthe seven planets of Mesopotamian astrology — and to be worn by the king:Among the Assyrian texts giving the formulae for incantations and variousmagical operations, there is one which treats of an ornament composed of sevenbrilliant stones, to be worn on the breast of the king as an amulet; indeed, sogreat was the virtue of these stones that they were supposed to constitute anornament for the gods also. The text, as rendered by Fossey, is as follows:“Incantation. The splendid stones! The splendid stones! The stones of abundanceand joy.“Made resplendent for the flesh of the gods.“The hulalini stone, the sirgarru stone, the hulalu stone, the sandu stone, theuknu stone.“The dushu stone, the precious stone elmeshu, perfect in celestial beauty.“The stone of which the pingu is set in gold.“Placed upon the shining breast of the king as an ornament.“Azagsud, high-priest of Bel, make them shine, make them sparkle!“Let the evil one keep aloof from the dwelling!”327 [4372.xhtml#4004]Note carefully the reference to the Assyrian high priest, exhorting him to makethe stones shine and sparkle, suggesting that not only did Egyptian templepriests have a secret of making gemstones phosphoresce, but that theirMesopotamian counterparts did as well.Similar breastplates were associated with Babylon and even the king of Tyre aswell.328 [4372.xhtml#4006] So what of the Hebrew high priest’s breastplate? Herethere is a rich rabbinical, and even Muslim, tradition. The 12 stones of thehigh priest’s breastplate are first associated with the 12 angels who “guard thegates of Paradise.”329 [4372.xhtml#4008] The Jewish historian Flavius Josephus,moreover, records a tradition in which the high priest’s garments were alsofastened at the shoulders with phosphorescing stones.330 [4372.xhtml#4010]Moreover, each of the 12 stones of the breastplate was engraved with the namesof each of the 12 tribes.331 [4372.xhtml#4012] Josephus further associates the12 stones of the ephod to the 12 months of the year,332 [4372.xhtml#4014] and tothe zodiac as well.333 [4372.xhtml#4016] By mediaeval times, Jewish traditiondefinitely associated the 12 tribes to the signs of the zodiac in the followingcorrespondence:Judah Aries Issachar Taurus Zebulun Gemini Reuben Cancer Simeon Leo Gad VirgoEphraim Libra Manasseh Scorpio Benjamin Sagittarius Dan Capricorn NaphtaliAquarius Asher Pisces334 [4372.xhtml#4018]The breastplate, like the Ark of the Covenant, is one of those objects ofhistorical and religious power from the Jewish temple that, after the fall ofJerusalem to the Roman armies in 70 A.D., seems to disappear from history. Wheredid the ephod with its precious gems go?Kunz’s answer is worth citing extensively:(T)he treasures of the temple were carried off to Rome, and we learn fromJosephus that the breastplate was deposited in the Temple of Concord, which hadbeen erected by Vespasian. Here it is believed to have been at the time of thesacking of Rome by the Vandals under Genseric, in 455, although Rev. C.W. Kingthinks it is not improbable that Alaric, king of the Visigoths, when he sackedRome in 410 A.D., might have secured this treasure. However, the expressstatement of Procopius that “the vessels of the Jews” were carried through thestreets of Constantinople, on the occasion of the Vandalic triumph ofBelisarius, in 534, may be taken as a confirmation of the conjecture that theVandals had secured possession of the breastplate and its jewels.It must, however, be carefully noted that Procopius nowhere mentions thebreastplate and that it need not have been included among “the vessels of theJews.” It appears that this part of the spoils of Belisarius was placed byJustinian (4830565) in the sacristy of the church of St. Sophia. Some timelater, the emperor is said to have heard of the saying of a certain Jew to theeffect that, until the treasures of the Temple were restored to Jerusalem, theywould bring misfortune upon any place where they might be kept. If this story betrue, Justinian may have felt that the fate of Rome was a lesson for him, andthat Constantinople must be saved from a like disaster. Moved by suchconsiderations, he is said to have sent the “sacred vessels” to Jerusalem, andthey were placed in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.This brings us to the last two events which can even be plausibly connected withthe mystic 12 gems — namely, the capture and sack of Jerusalem by the SassanianPersian king, Khusrau II, in 615, and the overthrow of the Sassanian Empire bythe Mohammedan Arabs, and the capture and sack of Ctesiphon, in 637. If we admitthat Khusrau took the sacred relics of the Temple with him to Persia, we may bereasonably sure that they were included among the spoils secured by the Arabconquerors, although King, who has ingeniously endeavored to trace out thehistory of the breastplate jewels after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.,believes that they may be still “buried in some unknown treasure-chamber of oneof the old Persian capitals.”A fact which had generally been overlooked by those who have embarked on the seaof conjecture relative to the fate of the breastplate stones is that a largeJewish contingent, numbering some twenty-six thousand men, formed part of theforce with which the Sassanian Persians captured Jerusalem, and they might welllay claim to any Jewish vessels of jewels that may have been secured by theconquerors. In this case, however, it is still probable that these preciousobjects fell into the hands of the Mohammedans who captured Jerusalem in thesame year in which they took Ctesiphon.335 [4372.xhtml#4020]Contrary to all those who believe that the Ark and breastplate ended up in theWest in the hands of the Vandals and Visigoths, Kunz is correct, for byinjecting the East Roman Empire back into the equation, he is clearly saying,“Look east rather than west” if one wishes to discover the whereabouts of theold Jewish temple treasure.336 [4372.xhtml#4022]"},{"pageContent":"C. CONCLUSIONSThe following constellation of relationships, and implications, has beenexhibited in this chapter:1. There are at least three disparate and significant clues to the existence ofan international money power in ancient times, and to its reliance upon preciousmetal bullion as a medium of monetary exchange:a. The unusual bullion policies of Rome vis-à-vis the Orient, which policieswere virtual opposites of each other with respect to the relative valuation ofsilver and gold bullion. Such reciprocal policies could, of course, highlybenefit an international money power with bases of operations in both places,for by transferring gold to the east and converting it to silver, and reapingthe fees thereof, and then silver to the west and converting again to gold, vastprofits could be accumulated;b. The almost universal association of temples with minting, from the MiddleEast to China and India; and,c. The presence of an international contingent of mercenaries from variouscountries and states at one of antiquity’s largest gold mines at Bisharee, mineswhich in turn are worked by slaves and prisoners of war.2. In addition to the association of temples with the minting and issuance ofmoney, and therefore with mining activity, these temples are also associatedwith astronomy and astrology;3. Additionally, astrology and astronomy are in turn associated with preciousgemstones, each type of which is associated with various planetary bodies andtheir influences;4. The various gods of the pantheons of the Middle East, since they can at onelevel be decoded as celestial bodies, are parallel, that is to say, the variouspantheons themselves show remarkable parallels due to their similar astrologicalderivation. At this juncture, a significant question was implied:a. Could the parallelism of various pantheons be due not only to theirastronomical derivation, but also because of the activity of that class ofinternational bullion brokers that appears to be associated with the temple inall lands, and influencing the bullion policy to its advantage in severalstates?b. If so, then is there a deeper reason for their association with the practiceof astrology in the temples? If there is, then what is it? And what is theconnection between all this, and precious gemstones?c. These gemstones were seen in turn by the ancients and in esoteric traditionto have certain powers; among these we note the following:i) They possessed the power to heal;ii) They possessed the power to predict the future;iii) They could phosphoresce under certain conditions, and this was most likelya closely held secret of the temple priesthoods in various civilizations;iv) They conferred invisibility;v) They conferred the power to levitate;vi) In Solomon’s case, certain stones conferred power over creation.We are thus in the presence of a complex dynamic, and making sense of it willnot be easy, but before we can address this issue, we must assemble more data bytaking a closer look at the activities of this ancient “bullion brokers’international,” for those activities will disclose the common thread and clue:alchemy."},{"pageContent":"FiveMONEY, MONOTHEISM, MONARCHIES AND MILITARIESTHE THESIS OF DAVID ASTLE[5761.jpeg]“They are but pudgy and sly little men as much overwhelmed by the monster theyhave raised, as are the foolish nations that permitted them to do so.”— David Astle337 [4372.xhtml#4024]"},{"pageContent":"A. THE STATE OF EVIDENCE AND THE NEED FOR SPECULATIONDavid Astle is a researcher who has assembled a massive database and well-arguedcase for the existence, in ancient times, of an international bullion brokers’trust, allied with the temple, manipulating governments, religions, pantheonsand policies behind the scenes for its own benefit and agenda. As such ourexamination here can only be a brief review of his work. It is to be emphasizedthat this review is but a small sampling of the types of evidence and analysesthat Astle provides.338 [4372.xhtml#4026]This being said, Astle himself provides a strong cautionary note on thedifficult state of the evidence, and the need for speculation. Noting that allancient societies had a system of state warehouses connected with its moneycoining and regulating power, Astle states thatIn almost all of the works of the great archaeologists and scholars specializingin the ancient civilizations, there is a virtual silence on that all importantmatter, the system of distribution of food surpluses, and surpluses of all thoseitems needed towards the maintenance of a good and continuing life so far aswere required by climate and custom.In all the writings of these great and practical scholars, the workings of thatmighty engine which injects the unit of exchange amongst the peoples, andwithout which no civilization as we know it can come to be, is only indicated bya profound silence. Of the system of exchanges, of the unit of exchange and itsissue by private individuals, as distinct from its issue by the authority ofsovereign rule, on this all important matter governing in such totality theconditions of progression into the future of these peoples, not a word to speakof.339 [4372.xhtml#4028]There is a related question, and Astle is quick to perceive it: not only isthere a paucity of evidence relating how such an international bullion brokers’class might have arisen nor evidence as to “what created them,”340[4372.xhtml#4030] it is the pervasive and almost universal absence of suchevidence that “borders on the mystifying.” Additionally, there is in scholarlyliterature on ancient international monetary policy a “complete failure tospeculate on those most important matters at all.” But most importantly, Astleobserves, there is a complete absence of speculation on “the true nature of theenergy source by which such machinery was driven.”341 [4372.xhtml#4032]While Astle clearly throughout his work believes that energy source to be thewidespread practice of slavery in ancient times, and while we tend to agree withhim insofar as that goes, there is a deeper question that Astle’s commentsdisclose: was there another and deeper energy source that existed in, or wasbeing sought by, those ancient “bullion brokers”’ fraternities besides slavery?In any case, it is this perplexing silence on such crucial matters that callsfor, indeed almost compels, speculation to fill the void.Practically no information seems to exist of the growth of private moneycreation in the days of the ancient city states of Mesopotamia of which, becauseof their records being preserved on fire-baked clay, more is known than of morerecent civilizations; and the gap must necessarily be filled by a certain amountof speculation. Little is known of the beginnings of the fraudulent issuance byprivate persons of the unit of exchange, as in opposition to the law of the godsfrom whom kings in ancient times claimed to derive their divine origin.342[4372.xhtml#4034]Thus, we now encounter a new dynamic: if the assumption of the existence of aprivate international bullion brokers’ power has merit, then there is a conflictbetween its private money-creating powers and that of the various states withinwhich it exists. There are thus two operating units of exchange according toAstle: on the one hand, one has the circulation of coins of bullion as a unit ofexchange, which coins were issued by temples and their allies, the bullionbrokers, those who controlled the mines and slaves. On the other hand, one hasthe issuance — in Mesopotamia — of clay units of exchange, issued by the statepower itself in conjunction with the temple, which units were backed by thesurpluses of the state warehouses.343 [4372.xhtml#4036]"},{"pageContent":"1. Ancient and Modern Banking ConspiracyNotwithstanding all this, Astle admits, largely on the types of considerationsadvanced in the previous chapter here, that there are significant indicatorswithin ancient societies of…(T)he existence of a far-reaching conspiracy in respect to monetary issuanceinfluencing the progression of man’s history in the earliest times of whichwritten records exists. It is also outstandingly clear that it was parent tothat acknowledged and most obvious conspiracy such as exists today.344[4372.xhtml#4038]There is, in other words, more or less a continuity between ancient times andmodern ones. The question is: what is the nature of that continuity? Is itmerely conceptual, rooted in the similarities of goals, methods, and beliefs ofthe people engaged in such activites? Or is the continuity deeper? Does itextend to actual descent of certain families and groups down through history? Aswill be seen in this chapter, one can answer at least the first question with aresounding affirmative. And as will be seen momentarily, there are alsosignificant indicators that the second question may be affirmatively answered insome cases as well."},{"pageContent":"B. THE MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE AND BULLION AS AN ORDER ON STATE WAREHOUSESAstle’s argument, while profound, is not always easily seen, scattered as it isthroughout his book. Care is required in noticing its steps and taking dueaccount of them in order that its transparency may be fully exhibited. We havealready noted in the previous chapter, and in this one, the following things:1. The regulation of the value of money was established by law and regulated bythe state or crown, whose sole prerogative was the issuance and regulation ofsuch units of money;2. There was a deep and profound relationship between the minting and issuanceof such money in the form of bullion-based coins by the crown or state power,and the temple;3. Prior to this period, however, in Mesopotamia, the units of exchange, asnoted by Astle, were simply clay tablets of credit against the surplus in thestate warehouse.It is at this last point that the story, and Astle’s argument, really begins.The reason is easily seen, for if one were to conduct trade between states, theissuances of money in the form of letters of credit against a given state’swarehouse surplus would inhibit, rather than aid, such trade. Another mechanismwas required that would not require a diplomatic negotiation between states foreach and every trade. Thus, at one and the same time as a medium ofinternational exchange is more or less agreed upon, there also arises aninternational class of merchants conducting such trade and exercising sweepinginfluence over those units of exchange. Astle states it with his characteristicsharpness and concision:Through stealthy issue of precious metal commodity money into circulationamongst the peoples, replacing that money which represented the fiat of will ofthe god of the city and which was merely an order on the state warehousesthrough his scribes, this internationally-minded group from the secrecy of theirchambers were able to make a mockery of the faith and belief of the simplepeople.345 [4372.xhtml#4040]In other words, at a certain juncture and by the nature of the case, there willbe two monies in circulation, one created by a private group and based onbullion commodity money issued as a facsimile of the state money for which itcan be traded and substituted, and the second, the original state-issued money.It should be noted that this situation is almost exactly paralleled in moderntimes by the issuance of state money and private notes both in England and inthe United States.346 [4372.xhtml#4042] In both the ancient and moderninstances, the privately-issued money gradually and with inexorableinevitability replaces the state issuance, and with that occurrence, the powerof the private issuers of such monies is established over a society.But how was this substitution actually made? What was the stratagem that made itpossible for ancient bullion brokers to achieve this extraordinary and sweepinginfluence over ancient states? The answers to these questions require an evencloser look."},{"pageContent":"1. The Control of Mining and BullionThe issuance of bullion-based monies implies something very significant, andAstle is quick to perceive it:The whole notion of the institution of precious metals by weight as commondenominator of exchanges, internationally and nationally, cannot but have beendisseminated by a conspiratorial organization fully aware of the extent of thepower to which it would accede, could it but maintain control over bullionsupplies and the mining which brought them into being in the first place.347[4372.xhtml#4044]We have already seen how Egypt’s Bisharee mines, with their contingent ofinternational mercenary guards, implies the existence of such an internationalclass of merchants and bullion brokers.As an inevitable consequence of such activity, “the law of the ruler previouslyexercised towards the well-being of the people in that might live a good andhonourable life accordingly became corrupted,”348 [4372.xhtml#4046] since thatcrown power was inevitably in collusion with the very class undermining itspower. This fact is attested by the rise of laws of punishment condemninglawbreakers to a lifetime of slavery working the semi-private mines whichsupplied both the state and the merchants with the medium of exchange thatcreated their profits. Again, the situation is almost exactly paralleled bymodern times, where one again encounters a private monied class in collusionwith the state power for the expansion of their powers over the great masses ofpeople.A further implication falls out from this, and again, one perceives instantlythe modern parallel:Kings largely became the mouthpiece and sword arm of those semi-secret societiesthat controlled the material of money as its outward and visible symbols came tobe restricted to gold, silver, and copper… The fiat of the god in heaven whichhad been the decisive force behind that which brought about an equitableexchange, was replaced by the will of those classes controlling the undertonesof civilization, leaders of the world of slave drivers, caravaneers, outcastsand criminals generally, such as was to be discerned on the edges of the ancientcity civilizations….. The instrument of this will was precious metal, whosesupply was controlled by the leaders of these classes through their control ofthe slave trade, since mining was rarely profitable in the case of the preciousmetals, except with slave labour…349 [4372.xhtml#4048]In support of this contention, Astle notes that prior to the fourth centuryB.C., the institution of slavery “had been more in the nature of a benign customsimilar to the custom of the bonded servant or apprentice of the 18th and 19thcenturies in Northern Europe.”350 [4372.xhtml#4050] After that period, however,it became an extensive and international trade, complete with whips and chainsand all the imagery of human suffering one associates with the institution.Thus we now have an increasingly expanded, and interesting, constellation ofrelationships:1. A relationship between priest-kings, the temple, money minting and issuance,and a private class of international bullion brokers;2. A relationship of the latter class with the slave trade necessary to conductprofitable mining to circulate bullion as a medium of exchange;3. A relationship of the temple with money minting and issuance on behalf ofthat private class of bullion brokers and slave traders; and finally,4. A relationship of the temple to astrology and all its associatedaccoutrements: gems, sacred geometry, earth grid locations for temples,priest-magicians, forecasters, and so on.The relationship between this private class and the temples in various statesexercised a correspondingly corrupting influence on their priesthoods:…(I)t is clear that with the growth of silver in circulation between privatepersons, and between private persons and states, as now would become aninevitability, that which had been total economic control from the gods throughhis servants in the Ziggurat, was bypassed, and merchants were not able to dealprivately using their credit, or powers of abstract money creation. They werealso able, through their control of distant mining operations, to afflict apreviously dedicated priesthood with thought of personal possession, and throughthe control of manufacture of weapons in distant places, they were able to armwarlike peoples towards the destruction of whosoever they might choose.351[4372.xhtml#4052]Notice the dynamic subtly suggested here, for through its associations with thevarious temple priesthoods such a class also influences war policies of thevarious states under its influence, and these as might be expected could oftenbe in the guise of religious conflicts.352 [4372.xhtml#4054]Citing scholar T.B.L. Webster, Astle comments at length on this dynamic:“The Alalakh tablets also record copper distributed to smiths, but not inaddition it is to be used for making baskets or arrowheads; and the King ofAssyria sent copper to Mari to be made into nails by the local craftsmen. AReport from Pylos that the woodcutters in two places are delivering 150 axlesand 150 spars for the chariot factory may be compared with the Ugartic texts onthe delivery of wood for the making of arms, and a note of wood delivered to thecarpenters for the construction of wagons in Alalakh. We made here also fromPylos a list of wooden objects made, a list of vessels received by men (perhapsMayors) in various places and a note of pieces of ivory; to set beside thisrather slender evidence of Mycenaean manufacture, Alalakh provides a record ofsixty-four business houses and their produce; they include smiths, leatherworkers, joiners, and cartwrights.”353 [4372.xhtml#4056]Thus it seems that where the conception of money as to a silver standard existedas at Ugarit and Alalakh, so also existed organized industry, includingoutstandingly the private manufacture of arms under methods that appear to bethose of semi-mass productions. It is not without significance that this earlyera of privately issued money (such as was silver money), and consequent privateindustry, particularly that which was devoted to arms manufacture, was incertain areas so coincidental with the massive movements of warlike peoples, andthe collapse of ancient empires that had lived long under the pattern of lifeknown as that of the Ancient Orient. Conquering peoples needed the best of arms.It seems that the best of arms were obtainable from private industry; andprivate industry in its turn needed silver or gold or labour, which was slaves,in payment. Both were obtainable as the result of war. Therefore parallel,though not entirely the same as in today, the more war, the more industry, andthe more the need for the products of the money creators’ ledgers. Hence becamethe more absolute the control of that which most of all designs industry and itsaccompanying slavery in one form or another, namely, the private money creativepower.354 [4372.xhtml#4058]In other words, the clues have been there all along, it is just that no one hasnoticed them, for the great war-making empires of Mesopotamia were involved withprivate arms manufacture and private money issuance. This fact will loom onlylarger as we proceed.But such large manufacturing and monetary concerns only lead inexorably back tothe relationship between crown and temple. The renowned historian ChristopherDawson outlines the relationship with a simplicity pregnant for implications:Originally the state and the temple corporations were the only bodies whichpossessed the necessary stability and resources for establishing widespreadcommercial relations. Temple servants were sent on distant missions, providedwith letters of credit which enabled them to obtain supplies in other cities.Moreover the temple was the bank of the community through which money could belent at interest and advances made to the farmer on the security of his crop.Thus in the course of the 3rd millennium there grew up in Mesopotamia a regularmoney economy based on precious metals as standards of exchange, whichstimulated private wealth and enterprise and led to real capitalist development.The temple and the palace remained the centres of the economic life of thecommunity but by their side and under their shelter there developed a many sidedactivity which found expression in the guilds of the free craftsmen and themerchants, and the private enterprise of the individual capitalist.355[4372.xhtml#4060]To put it simply, the fact of the existence of this class is not disputed byreputable historians. And the international extent of this trade should not beoverlooked, for trade was known to extend from the city of Ur “over the wholeknown world which certainly reached as far afield as Europe, being carried on bymeans of letters of credit, bills of exchange and ‘promises to pay’ (cheques),made out in terms of staple necessities; of life expressed in terms of silver atvaluation of barley (probably at a given season of the year).”356[4372.xhtml#4062] This state of affairs clearly implies an international extentto some banking and merchant class, in alliance with the temples of variousstates. But how would such a class arise and usurp the crown prerogative ofmoney minting, value regulation, and issuance?"},{"pageContent":"2. Ancient Babylon and EgyptThe answer to this question requires a closer scrutiny of the two major militaryand financial powers of that age: Egypt and Babylon. As noted so far, Babylonianmoney initially consisted of circulating clay-tablet letters of credit drawn onthe surpluses of the state warehouses, and therefore its issuance as money wasstrictly controlled by the crown. But as also noted immediately above, at somejuncture — as early as the third or fourth century B.C., in fact357[4372.xhtml#4064] — these existed alongside these clay tablets circulatingsilver of private issuance, whose value was also fixed in terms of barley orother staples in the state warehouses. In fact, so widespread was the use of theBabylonian system, which also included the use of actual checks, that one findsBabylonians at work in the temples and minting shops of some Greek cities afterthe Assyrian assault on Babylonia itself.358 [4372.xhtml#4066] In other words,assaults on Babylon only served to disperse its merchant banking class in othercountries, and with that dispersal, the expansion of Babylonian business andbanking practices.a. Early Egypt’s Independence from the Babylonian Money PowerIt is in this context, then, that the Egyptian money power should be examined,for as has already been noted, Egypt controlled the largest and most productivegold mines — the Bisharee mines — in the ancient world. Here too one notes aparallel development and all its implications:According to Breasted, gold and copper rings of a fixed weight circulated inlarge scale business in the time of the “Old Kingdom,” and (significantly enoughto the student of “banking,” or private money creation and regulation, as itmight better be known) “stone weights were already marked with their equivalencein such rings.” The circulation as money of these “promises to pay” recorded onstone, pointedly suggests the likelihood of the activities of a secretfraternity whose hereditary trade was private money creation.359[4372.xhtml#4068]Indeed, the parallel with Babylon is almost identical, since the latter usedclay tablets as units of exchange, while Egypt used stone weights marked withtheir equivalent value in precious bullion. But there is likewise a significantdifference as well, for in Babylon’s case those clay tablets circulated as moneyprior to the issuance of bullion-based monies, and the value of such monies wasstated in terms of stores in the state warehouse. But with Egypt, one finds alater stage of development, for the value of the stones is expressed, not interms of the surplus stores in a warehouse, but in terms of bullion itself. Inshort, the concept of money has been degraded, and with it, there is almost novisible connection to the state and crown prerogative of money regulation andissuance, not to mention anything of practical value as the result of industryor creativity, i.e., goods.And this degradation of money in Egypt, i.e., the fact that its promises to payare expressed in valuation of bullion, rather than bullion being expressed invaluation of real goods, plus the fact of the existence of Egypt’s Bishareemines with their international contingent of mercenary guards, points to a verysignificant and — because of its subtlety — often overlooked point:As a result, although the Egyptian empire in the earliest years might very wellbe described as a common market existing independent of the Babylonian moneypower, and deriving its strength from the will to be of a dedicated andinstructed Ruler, the sequence of events shows that through those concessions itobtained for its best services in war, it was not long before internationalmoney power re-penetrated the substructure of Egyptian life and established itsusual behind-the-scenes influence, if not control, as in the earlier time thatdenoted the collapse of the “Old Kingdom.” It may safely be considered to havereassumed the position of hidden power it had held a thousand years beforeduring the closing years of the 6th dynasty, a period in which the stone weightsindicating equivalence in metal money circulated in much the same way as clayfacsimiles of contemporary coinages circulated…360 [4372.xhtml#4070]To put it differently, Egypt, once under the influence of that internationalbullion brokers’ power, had managed to throw off that influence, only to have itrestored nearly a millennium later."},{"pageContent":"3. The Conspirators at Worka. Economic and Military Autarchy and Modern Analogues: Sparta and the GreekTyrantsBut how, exactly, does one know that such an international money power existedin ancient times? Astle’s answer is as surprising as it is both contemporary andsimple: one had only to look at certain ancient wars in conjunction with a lookat the economic activity and policies of various states to discern a hidden handat work. And the best example of this war between a money power and a statedetermined to maintain its independence from it, its autarchy, are thePeloponnesian Wars between Athens and its allies, and Sparta. It is worth citingAstle and his sources at length:Of the tyrants of Greece and Asia Minor in ancient times, the learned ProfessorHeichelheim wrote:“These tyrants were for the most part members of the nobility themselves who hadmade the grade using the new political and economic possibilities of their timeto overthrow their own equals and to subdue their whole state temporarily. Thetyrants were often compelled to introduce the coin economy pattern into the areaover which they ruled, or at least to promote its development officially, inorder to gain the upper hand over their enemies…(One wonders: Compelled by whom?)…to stabilize the position of the peasantry on the land, and to expand andrebuild state economy, a central distribution of money and goods in kind partlydirected towards mercenaries, bodyguards and various political friends andpartly indirectly to the masses of poor people in the form of wages paid forextensive building operations and improvements, is characteristic of tyranteconomy…361 [4372.xhtml#4072]Astle comments as follows:The above remarks of Professor Heichelheim indicate there were “new politicaland economic possibilities: in that period 650-500 B.C. when the tyrannies mostof all flourished… The question then becomes, what were these “new political andeconomic possibilities”?... The answer is arrived at readily: they derived fromthe activities of the agents of the international silver bullion brokers who,from ports such as Argos, Athens, and Aegina where King Pheidon struck the firstGreek silver coinage ca. 680 B.C., promoted the luxury traders who sold theirwares from wigs to harlots as against the new silver coinage or promise thereof.The opportunities clearly were for those who assisted in the monetization of thecity, and all its activities and possessions, and its population….362[4372.xhtml#4074]The result of this “monetization” of the city-state — and of the reduction ofeach member of its population to the status of a mere “human resource” (to usethe modern term) — was, according to Professor Heichelheim, entirelypredictable, and eerily reminiscent of the “free trade” agreements of the late1980s and 1990s and of their disastrous effects on the industrialized societiesthat adopted them (and remember, Heichelheim was writing in the 1940s, longbefore such agreements were in the offing, and was speaking of ancient times!):The aristocracies refused equality to the landless traders and manufacturers,the peasants were oppressed by the rich and encouraged to get into debt and thenwere reduced to slavery and exile; slaves began to compete with free labour.Ambitious individuals capitalized this discontent to overthrow the constitutedgovernment and establish themselves as tyrants in all the Greek cities with thenotable exception of Sparta.363 [4372.xhtml#4076]So what is so significant about Sparta that the rest of the Greek city-stateswent to war with her?Astle puts it “country simple”:…(T)he state that rejected international money power, as did Sparta and Rome inancient times, and Russia in modern times, had to be prepared to establish totalmilitary self-sufficiency.364 [4372.xhtml#4078]One might add Nazi Germany to Astle’s list, for like Russia and ancient Sparta,the regime of the Third Reich had determined not only to restore the issuance ofmoney to the State, but had embarked on a program of military and energyautarchy as well.365 [4372.xhtml#4080]So what, exactly, had Sparta done that so infuriated the rest of the Greekcity-states? The answer is complex, and requires a brief detour. Both Plato366[4372.xhtml#4082] and Aristotle367 [4372.xhtml#4084] were clear that money hadvalue only insofar as it was defined by the law of the state; in other words,they both obliquely recognized that the power of issuing and regulating thevalue of money was a state, not a private, prerogative, and this in spite of thefact that by their time, the private issuance of money was well-establishedpractice.368 [4372.xhtml#4086] Thus, when one turns to the city-states of thetyrants, and to their silver-coin issuances, one discerns a clear, thoughcarefully disguised, hidden hand:The evidence that the earliest coinages in Greece had essentially a localcirculation in no way alters the picture previously outlined of silver money asbeing part of an international conspiracy. All Greek states apart from Athensand Samos, Siphnos and Corcyra, and possible one or two others, had to obtainsilver bullion for their coinage from abroad, which necessarily obliged them todeal with those traders who specialized in dealing in bullion. Such trade inbullion had to be in the hands of a small and highly secretive group, as much onaccount of the sources of supply being relatively few and scattered as it wereout to the ends of the earth, as on account of the fact that it would be onlysuch a group that could also control those supplies of slave labour and theirpurchase from triumphant peoples whose warlike activities, as likely as not,they had instigated themselves; slave labour so necessary to the success oftheir mining operations.369 [4372.xhtml#4088]Once the course had been determined in various Greek city-states to issuebullion-based money, which bullion they had in scarce supply, those city-statescame increasingly under the influence and sway of the bullion brokersthemselves. All except one, which refused to issue bullion-based coinage.Sparta.Hence one has now a basis of understanding for Sparta’s well-known harshness andthe military discipline it imposed on her whole population, for if she were tomaintain her independence of the money power infecting the other Greekcity-states, her military had to be the best. Thus, there is a hidden, and muchmore real, purpose to the infamous Peloponnesian War — a war that neither Athensnor Sparta “had won and neither one had lost.” The war left both powerful Greekcity-states “exhausted, and over their prostrate bodies the servants of thissame sardonic Money power drew the chains of their slavery.”370[4372.xhtml#4090] That real underlying purpose of the Peloponnesian War “was toestablish private common money market across the Greek world totally controlledby the trapezitae or bankers in modern terminology.”371 [4372.xhtml#4092]Consequently, “judging by Sparta…and later by Rome itself, it seems that inancient times there was some considerable understanding of the power inherent inprecious metal money to destroy, by lending itself to manipulation, the statusquo of any race or state.”372 [4372.xhtml#4094]b. Babylon, Persia, and Money CreationYet another, and even more persuasive, example of the actions and hiddendirections of a money power on the international scene is afforded by the caseof Babylon and Persia. It is worth citing Astle at length once again:It is not until the Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, and Persian eras that clearevidence can be traced of the total degeneration of kingly power and of kingsand so-called emperors as quite often being little more than gloriouslybe-medalled front men for private money creative power striving to createworld-wide hegemony… They still continued to be needed principally as a pointtowards which the eyes of the people might be diverted in order that the peoplemight not realize that all was not well in that direction towards which theirloyalties naturally leaned, nor glimpse the destructive forces that were gnawingat the roots of the Tree of Life itself. Even as far back as 2500 B.C. Sargon ofAkkad proceeded into Anatolia to chastise the city of Ganes on account of thecommercial community of Mesopotamia; probably to enforce the payment of intereston loans, or repayment of principal… One of the reasons of the success of Cyrus,though but a petty Persian prince formerly to 550 B.C. when he deposed hissovereign, Astyages the Mede, is clear from the circumstances of his victoryover Croesus of Lydia in 546 B.C.Croesus had offended the international money powers by seizure of their treasureheld by their agent Sadyattes, and by the total assumption of monetary issue bythe state. Example had to be made of him to deter other princes from similaraction, and the eager and ambitious Cyrus was obviously the one chosen for thispurpose. According to the article on Babylonia in the Encyclopedia Britannica,9th edition, by Professor Sayce, Croesus had rashly joined battle with Cyruswithout waiting for the arrival of his Babylonian allies under Nabu-Nahua thefather of Belshazzar of the Book of Daniel. It is more than likely however, thata truer reading of these events would be that international money power, patronof the rise of Cyrus both through organization of his supplies of mercenarysoldiers, and of the best of weapons, had been the principal influence in theseevents as in other enterprises of Cyrus, such as the siege of Babylon 14 yearslater. Thanks to his influence, while the progress of Nabu-Nahua towardsjunction with the forces of Croesus would have been sabotaged, Croesus himselfwould have been misinformed of the intentions and strength of both Cyrus andNabu-Nahua.Cyrus won the day, and Croesus was totally humbled. Having thus proven his“suitability,” and his readiness to promote the policies of his financialbackers, the relatively easy conquest of Babylon was arranged for Cyrus somefourteen years later.373 [4372.xhtml#4096]Who arranged for the easy conquest of Babylon? More importantly, who financedthe vast Persian war machine?The answer, according to Astle, is a biblical one. “It is interesting to note,”he observes,That shortly after the entry of the Persian forces into the city, the “Childrenof Israel” were permitted to return to that which they considered theirhomeland, and every assistance was given them towards renewal of their nationallife and the rebuilding of their temple, which, of course, was its heart…. Thespecial concessions made by Cyrus to the Hebrew almost on entry into the city ofBabylon, would certainly suggest that he had received their substantialassistance, perhaps through financing towards the purchase of the finest ofmilitary accoutrements such as would be obtainable only through the good gracesof the Babylonian commercial and banking houses, or through that informationwith which the Hebrew may have kept him constantly supplied such as the state ofmilitary preparedness within the city, etc.It may reasonably be assumed that the Babylonian money power was completelyinternational in outlook, whatever its outward profession, and totallyunsympathetic towards the ancient faith of the Ziggurat and the worship ofMarduk, and towards the intended effects of the restoration of the Ziggurat atUr, at that time, by Nebuchadnezzar. If in earlier Assyrian times such moneypower certainly was not the Hebrew, though possibly linked thereto throughmembers of the latter Israelitish Confederacy… the fact of the existence ofpowerful Hebrew influence in international finance in Neo-Babylonian times seemsa reasonable supposition.The Hebrew…may have risen to especially privileged position in the Babylonianmoney industry, if that is what it can be called, and may have come to learn atthat time those secret practices of the money changers’ craft, which he wascertainly forbidden in his native land, according to the Laws (of) Moses.374[4372.xhtml#4098]Indeed, as Astle points out, the Hebrews returning to Palestine were compelled,under Ezra’s edict, to divorce their foreign wives. While certainly explainableas a religious ordinance designed to restore doctrinal and racial purity, Astlenotes that the practice of intermarriage is itself the hallmark of theinternational banking class to this day, and thus, Ezra’s ordinance may itselfbe an indicator that the Hebrews had indeed penetrated the international moneypower during the Babylonian captivity.375 [4372.xhtml#4100] There is yet anotherindicator of this “babylonization” of Hebrew religion and practice, and that isthe existence of the Talmud and the rabbinate itself, and the adopted symbol ofthe Hebrews and Jewish people to this day, the so-called Mogen David or Star ofDavid: ☆. This symbol is itself of Babylonian, not Hebrew, origin, and as weshall see in the next chapter, it is an apt symbol of a fraternity that is“keeping secrets.”"},{"pageContent":"C. HOW THE CONSPIRACY WORKEDIt is perhaps in the actual history of the development of the private issuanceof bullion-based monies in ancient times and in various civilizations that onemost clearly discerns the evident hand of a hidden international class ofbullion-brokers, war merchants, slave traders, and mining operators, for almostinvariably, the pattern is the same."},{"pageContent":"1. The First Stage: Penetrate and Ally with the TempleAs noted repeatedly throughout the previous pages, from Greece to Rome to Egyptand the Mesopotamian civilizations of Sumer, Babylon, and Assyria, there is aclear association of banking activities, and of minting itself, with the temple.The reason for this association, at least as far as banking and finance go, areeasy to rationalize:These persons had conducted their business in the shade of the temple courtyardsfrom ancient days as, and if they could, in order that the power or mystery aslocally was held in awe, might give sanctity to their activities which so oftenwere exercised against the well being of the people who sheltered them….These agents would have lurked as only faintly discernible shadows behind thetemple façade, although they instigated much of what came to pass in those days,if themselves so little seen. Of first concern to them would have been thereputation of their masters, the priesthood, for piety, probity, and godliness,in so far as appearance went. For by maintaining the position of the priesthood,they maintained themselves and their secret power; yet for whatever they broughtabout, especially if of evil, it may safely be assumed, a nevertheless inviolatepriesthood would be held responsible.With the sanctity of the temple as a shelter and cloak of their activities, thisbullion brokers’ class could then engage in the next stage of their activity:"},{"pageContent":"2. The Second Stage: Issue False ReceiptsThat second stage is to issue counterfeit or false receipts against the creditor surpluses of the state warehouse, and thereby to increase the money supplyitself: the principal device at this stage “may be assumed to be the secret andprivate expansion of the total money supply effected primarily by the issuanceinto circulation of false receipts for…valuables supposedly being held ondeposit in thief-proof vaults, or otherwise, for safe custody.”376[4372.xhtml#4102] Such issuance would be relatively easy to come by, for bypenetration of and close association with the temples of various states, theywould have had access to the seals and other devices used to authenticateletters of credit by the temple priesthoods."},{"pageContent":"3. The Third Stage: Substitute Bullion for Letters of Credit as a MeasureAgainst False ReceiptsThis brings us inevitably to the third stage, for once a sufficient number ofsuch false receipts were in circulation, it would become apparent both to thecrown and to members of the temple itself that there were simply too many falsereceipts in circulation, and that a monetary reform was necessary. At thisjuncture, in step the bullion brokers with the solution: holding a virtualmonopoly on mining, they propose the substitution of bullion-based coinage,whose value is initially defined by a certain amount of actual goods — barley,as we saw in the case of Mesopotamia — for the actual state-issued letters ofcredit. Once any crown and temple alliance within any given state accepts thisarrangement, it will become increasingly hostage to the need for bullion and forthe merchants, slave traders, and mining-mercenaries that can supply it, andthat have the technology to mine and melt and mint it.377 [4372.xhtml#4104]"},{"pageContent":"4. The Fourth Stage: Then Create a Facsimile of MoneyHaving artificially stimulated and increased the value of bullion, this classthen creates the final step: it issues new letters of credit against the supplyof bullion rather than against the warehouse surplus, and defines those lettersof credit as valuation in terms of weight of some precious bullion. Thus, wearrive back at the state of issuing false receipts, only in this instance, thesereceipts are neither false nor counterfeit, they are simply privately creatednotes or promises to pay a certain amount of bullion (which they also control).Thus, once again the money supply is not only expanded, but the use of suchinstruments actually served to allow the bullion brokers to circulate more ofsuch notes than they had actual bullion to redeem. The key, once again, was thesanctifying probity that the temple association gave them. With this step, theirpower and influence over the various states which they penetrated was almostcomplete, for it gave these ancient bankers, like their modern counterparts, theability to expand or contract a state’s money supply, and to control theireconomies to create boom or bust. The final step, in other words, was to createa clay or stone (or in modern times, paper or plastic) facsimile of thefacsimile of state-issued money (the bullion-based monies, also of their owncreation)!"},{"pageContent":"D. THE PARALLEL TO THE AFTERMATHS OF THE COSMIC WAR, AND WORLD WAR II: THEGLOBALIST AGENDA AND MONEY, MONARCHIES, MONOTHEISM, AND MILITARIESBut there is a final piece to this ancient story and plot, and it is one of themost breathtaking of them all. The effect of the alliance of this bullionbrokers’ class with the temple throughout the ancient world would have broughtto their attention the fact that the pantheons of various civilizations, andeven the stories and acts associated with various gods, were all remarkablysimilar. As a result of this realization, the bullion brokers would also comeTo realize that they could actually create that which functioned as money withbut the record incised by the stylus on the clay tablet promising metal ormoney. Obviously, as a result of this discovery which depended on the confidencethey were able to create in the minds of the peoples of their integrity,provided they banded themselves together with an absolute secrecy that excludedall other than their proven brethren, they could replace the god of the cityhimself as the giver of all. If so be they could institute a conception of a onegod, their god, a special god of the world, a god above all gods, then notmerely the city, be it Ur or Kish or Lagash or Uruk, but the world itself couldbe theirs, and all that in it was.378 [4372.xhtml#4106]In other words, behind the creation of the vast empires of Persia, and later theMacedonian-Greek empire of Alexander the Great, there lies the activity of apowerful financial interest, striving to create an ancient “New World Order”with a central state and unified religio-cultural world.379 [4372.xhtml#4108]And the mechanism by which to foster this religious worldview would be togradually point out, and inculcate the idea in popular imagination, that alllocal religions were but the same thing, various “names” for the “same gods.”380[4372.xhtml#4110] Thus, the whole weight of their combine and cabal would havebeen thrown behind the promotion of a monarchial front, representative of thenew empire and the new monotheism, and backed by the latest in militaryhardware.But there is another possibility, one suggested by the scenario of a cosmic waroutlined in the first chapter,381 [4372.xhtml#4112] and that is, if thesurvivors of a once scientifically sophisticated civilization were ever to reachthe pinnacle of scientific power and achievement that would have made aninterplanetary war possible, if, that is, they were ever to reconstruct thedestructive technologies of their hegemony and extend themselves again intospace, then they would have quite literally to draw on the full resources of theentire world, and to create the wars and conflicts that drove technologicalachievement forward at a faster-than-normal pace of development. In this case,they would develop not only secret associations for this purpose, but money, anda close association with the temples, would be the easiest and leasttechnologically sophisticated method to do it. And the political goal would bethe same: ever-larger empires, eventually to encompass the entire globe itself.This association of money creation with the temples, and with the goal to createa unified world order, for the purpose of reconstructing a lost technology ofhegemony, is where the story gets really interesting.

Why do we find a startling ancient connection between banking andphysics (in the form of astrology, astronomy, and even — as Hoagland has hinted— sacred geometry)? Why do we find an RCA engineer named Nelson drawing upplanetary charts that look for all the world like astrological charts? Why do weencounter a government economist like Edward Dewey devoting a lifetime of workto the study of cycles of all sorts? And why do we find him making conscious anddeliberate reference between economic activity and physics? And why do we find,not just in ancient times, but in modern ones as well, the presence of bankerson the peripheries of such investigations?"},{"pageContent":"A. ECONOPHYSICS"},{"pageContent":"1. Physicists Invade Finance: The Modern Model as a Key to the Paleoancient PastThe answer lies in part in modern times, and in order to begin to peel back theonion skin layers of this vast, intricate, and ancient relationship, one mustlook at the rise of a new discipline — “econophysics” — and at what happened inmodern times as physicists entered the world of high finance, bringing theirtechniques and tools of applied mathematics and analysis with them.The term “econophysics” was actually coined in the mid-1990s by H. EugeneStanley383 [4372.xhtml#4116] to reflect two things: first, it was designed toreflect the vast influx of degreed physicists into the financial sector itself,as that sector often provided a higher salary base and opportunities to employthe tools of applied mathematical analysis than was possible in actual standardacademic or experimental careers, and secondly, it was reflective of thefascination that physicists had acquired for the application of the techniquesof statistical analysis they had developed in quantum mechanics to the problemsof economic and financial analysis itself.As such, econophysics “is an interdisciplinary research field, applying theoriesand methods originally developed by physicists in order to solve problems ineconomics, usually those including uncertainty or stochastic processes andnonlinear dynamics.”384 [4372.xhtml#4118] What spurred this interest was inpart, according to the article in Wikipedia, the “availability of huge amountsof financial data, starting in the 1980s.”385 [4372.xhtml#4120] Of course, ashas been noted, this is not exactly true, since there was a vast amount of dataavailable from the Department of Commerce and from other sources and countriesdating much further back, a database utilized by Edward and the Foundation forthe Study of Cycles, and a database known to its members, some of whom includedeconomists from major international banks.One thing in particular that attracted physicists to this study of theapplication of their techniques to financial and economic systems was preciselythat in economics, more often than not, there prevailed a general condition ofnon-equilibrium,386 [4372.xhtml#4122] that is, one was never dealing withsystems where there was a uniform distribution of resources, wealth, and so on.As physicists and chemists had only recently — in the 1960s — begun to studynon-equilibrium physical systems and their remarkable ability to self-organize,the motivation for their study of economics becomes clear: physicists thoughtthat by studying the most notoriously non-equilibrium systems known to mankind —economic systems — their models of the ability of such systems in the physicalworld could be applied with some success to model self-organization in economicsystems, and to make valuable predictions on that basis. As will be seen in afew moments, this is an important clue to the possible deeper physics involvedin economic systems.To put it succinctly, quantum mechanics had invaded economics, and the reasonwhy is relatively easy to perceive, because since economic activity was “theresult of the interaction among many heterogeneous agents, there is an analogywith statistical mechanics, where many particles interact.”387 [4372.xhtml#4124]And the key tool in this new interdisciplinary endeavor was quantum physics’ useof the “path integral formulation of statistical mechanics.”388[4372.xhtml#4126]But what exactly does this mean?The first implication is that one may use the influx of physicists into economicstudy in modern times as an analogy of what happened in ancient times, andassume that something like this happened as well in ancient times, as those withthe “high knowledge” of a deeper physics penetrated the world of high finance,that is to say, the temple, seeking a better standard of living and personalwealth, like their modern descendants. And once inside those hallowed pavilionsand chambers, they allied with the bankers of their day, the “bullion brokers.”It was a necessary détente in the aftermath of that great Cosmic War, for if thelost science and technology were ever to be reconstructed, it would require lotsof money, and lots of scientific expertise, and both resided in ancient times inthe temple.The second implication requires a closer look at quantum mechanics itself."},{"pageContent":"2. Quantum Mechanics, Ancient Astrology, and the Statistical ApproachOne may gain an appreciation of the statistical nature of quantum mechanics byconsidering its foundational principle, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle,itself. Briefly stated, the Uncertainty Principle holds that if one measures thevelocity of an electron, one cannot measure its position, and conversely, if onemeasures its position, it is impossible to measure its velocity. Thus, quantummechanics, when considering the behavior of several particles all at once, hadto rely upon observation and the compilation of statistical probabilities inorder to model that behavior.The same holds true, if one takes the ancient texts at face value, for astrologyas well, for there is an exact modern analogy with quantum mechanics and itscountless and untold observations made diligently over time, and with itsstatistical approach to that vast number of interactions, for this is preciselywhat one encounters in ancient times as well. In fact, as previously noted, theBabylonian “omen tablets” indicate that astronomical observations of planetaryalignments and corresponding earthly activities and effects — a combination wenow call astrology — were made over hundreds of thousands of years ago. This istherefore yet another sign that there is some other hidden influence at work inthe temples besides that of the bullion brokers, and that influence is that ofthe ancient astrologers-astronomers themselves, compiling their lists ofobservations. From the previous chapters it is evident that the ancientinternational “bullion brokers” were in league with the various templepriesthoods-astrologers."},{"pageContent":"3. Dr. Li’s Gaussian Copula and a Physics Analogue: The Multibody ProblemQuantum mechanics’ statistical approach, and that implied by the millennia ofancient astronomical and astrological observation, is directly connected to Dr.David Li’s Gaussian copula formula via a rather interesting route: the multibodyproblem. The problem is an exact analogue to the difficulty of modeling thebehavior of mass aggregates of particles. The only way to do so was throughcareful and countless observations and a statistical model of probabilities oftheir behavior. But the problem becomes more acute as the size of bodies beingmodeled grows.Imagine one is trying to model not the aggregate behavior of several particles,but of several planets and stars. It is relatively easy to model the force ofgravitational attraction between two moving masses or planets, and to predicttheir behavior. But as one adds more and more moving masses to the system to bemodeled, the ability of mathematics to handle and accurately predict thebehavior of a total dynamic system or any of the individual components within itprogressively breaks down, and margins of error increase. Dr. Li, of course,solved his “multibody problem” of correlations of economic activity by,predictably enough, a statistical approach, which introduced the problem ofrandom probabilities into economic activity.But what if the randomness of quantum mechanics was itself the result of adeeper physics? And, if that be so, and since “econophysics” was but theimportation into economics of physical models, would that deeper physics also bea deeper physics of economic activity?"},{"pageContent":"4. The Deeper Physics:a. David Bohm’s Hidden Variable Quantum Mechanics and The Implicate OrderThe deeper physics implied by this question may be readily perceived by a reviewof one of its most famous expositors, the well-known plasma and quantumphysicist David Bohm. Bohm is best known, in fact, for his “hidden variable”version of quantum mechanical theory, in which the “randomness” of quantummechanics observed and measured by physicists (Bohm’s “explicate order”) isunderstood to point to a deeper and more ordered hyper-dimensional reality(Bohm’s “implicate order”). Bohm outlined these views in a popularized treatmentin a book entitled Wholeness and the Implicate Order, and it is this book thatwill be the basis of our review of his ideas.For Bohm, the whole development of quantum mechanics pointed to the realexistence of this hyper-dimensional “implicate order”:One discovers…both from consideration of the meaning of the mathematicalequations and from the results of the actual experiments, that the variousparticles have to be taken literally as projections of a higher-dimensionalreality which cannot be accounted for in terms of any force of interactionbetween them389 [4372.xhtml#4128]In other words, Bohm is saying almost exactly the same thing as was Richard C.Hoagland at the beginning of this chapter: particles, as rotating masses, andwhose behavior when measured as a statistical aggregate, are portals that “gate”a hyper-dimensional reality into our own world. While Hoagland, however, wasconcerned with the hyper-dimensional implications of the physics of very largemasses, i.e., stars, Bohm is concerned with the hyper-dimensional implicationsof the physics of the very small. This is an indicator that the physics involvedis scale-invariant, that is, applicable over the whole range of scales ofobjects with which physics deals.Bohm’s apt analogy of the interaction of this hyper-dimensional world with ourown is that of a projection. “Let us begin,” he says, “with a rectangular tankfull of water, with transparent walls.”390 [4372.xhtml#4130] He then reproducesa diagram of a fish tank, with two television cameras, one pointed at one sideof the tank, and the other at the side perpendicular to each. Each camera, “A”and “B” respectively, is attached to one television monitor. As the fish swimsaround, the images from the two cameras are sent to the monitors. Bohm thencomments as follows:What we will see there is a certain relationship between the images appearing onthe two screens. For example, on screen A we may see an image of a fish, and onscreen B we will see another such image. At any given moment each image willgenerally look different from the other. Nevertheless the differences will berelated, in the sense that when one image is seen to execute certain movements,the other will be seen to execute corresponding movements. Moreover, contentthat is mainly on one screen will pass into the other, and vice versa (e.g.,when a fish initially facing camera A turns through a right angle, the imagethat was on A is now to be found on B). Thus at all times the image content onthe other screen will correlate with and reflect that of the other.391[4372.xhtml#4132]In other words, our three-dimensional world acts as a sort of “prism” to breakup a singular hyper-dimensional object into a fragmented thing, perceived fromdifferent angles but with correlated movements.Bohm summarizes this view of our three-dimensional reality as a projection froma high-dimensional reality, and its effect on perceptions of quantum mechanicsand its underlying implicate order, with words eerily evocative of Hoagland’scomments about stars at the beginning of this chapter:…(W)e may regard each of the “particles” constituting a system as a projectionof a “higher-dimensional” reality, rather than as a separate particle, existingtogether with all the others in a common three-dimensional space. For example,in the experiment of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, which we have mentionedearlier, each of two atoms that initially combine to form a single molecule areto be regarded as three-dimensional projections of a six-dimensional reality.392[4372.xhtml#4134]However, it is when Bohm turns to a consideration of the implications of thisview that the full scope of the possibilities of this deeper physics springsinto full view, and with them, the reason for the association of banksters withtemples in ancient times — not to mention modern times! — becomes a littleclearer.To make these implications manifest, Bohm begins by noting that…(W)hen the quantum theory is applied to fields… it is found that the possiblestates of energy of this field are discrete (or quantized). Such a state of thefield is, in some respects, a wavelike excitation spreading out over a broadregion of space. Nevertheless, it also has somehow a discrete quantum of energy(and momentum) proportional to its frequency, so that, in other respects it islike a particle (e.g. a photon). However, if one considers the electromagneticfield in empty space, for example, one finds from the quantum theory that eachsuch “wave-particle” mode of excitation of the field has what is called a“zero-point” energy, below which it cannot go, even when its energy falls to theminimum that is possible. If one were to add up the energies of all the“wave-particle” modes of excitation in any region of space, the result would beinfinite, because an infinite number of wavelengths is present.393[4372.xhtml#4136]Before we can proceed, it is necessary to pause and consider how Bohm hascharacterized the zero-point energy. For Bohm, as the passage just quoted makesclear, this energy is a result of the quantized nature of space itself, and ofthe fact that this quantization is the result of wavelike structures — of areasof compression and rarefaction — within it.Why this is so requires only a moment’s reflection. When a physicist suggeststhat space itself is quantized, what he means is simply that it is not aninfinitely divisible continuum, capable of being divided into ever smaller unitsor cells ad infinitum. The reason is, according to Bohm, that if space itself isthe result of wavelike structures of compression and rarefaction, then suchwavelike structures will inevitably induce cells within it. What appears to bean infinitely divisible continuum, therefore, is really so only because of theinfinite number of wavelengths present at any given point of vacuum space.This conception leads Bohm to posit the next step toward the quantization ofspace itself:…(T)here is good reason to suppose that one need not keep on adding the energiescorresponding to shorter and shorter wavelengths. There may be a certainshortest possible wavelength, so that the total number of modes of excitation,and therefore the energy, would be finite.394 [4372.xhtml#4138]We will refer to this “shortest possible wavelength” as the “Bohm wavelength.”This “Bohm wavelength” — the idea that wavelike phenomena are themselvesquantized — has profound and huge implications for the type of “deeper physics”being explored here. For one thing, this unknown wavelength sounds very muchlike the “lost word” of Masonic tradition, or the “lost chord” of the esotericdoctrine of the harmony of the spheres, the lost chord being the frequency whichsomehow binds all of physical creation together, since the latter is but aharmonic or overtone series of it.This conception turns out to have huge implications for the possible unificationof the physics of the very large with the physics of the very small:Indeed, if one applies the rules of quantum theory to the currently acceptedgeneral theory of relativity, one finds that the gravitational field is alsoconstituted of such “wave-particle” modes, each having a minimum “zero-point”energy. As a result the gravitational field, and therefore the definition ofwhat is to be meant by distance, cease to be completely defined. As we keep onadding excitations corresponding to shorter and shorter wavelengths to thegravitational field, we come to a certain length at which the measurement ofspace and time becomes totally undefinable [sic]. Beyond this, the whole notionof space and time as we know it would face out, into something that is atpresent unspecifiable. So it would be reasonable to suppose, at leastprovisionally, that this is the shortest wavelength that should be considered ascontributing to the “zero-point” energy of space.395 [4372.xhtml#4140]In short, find that wavelength and one will find the ability to engineerspace-time and all that is in it. One would be able to tap into a virtuallyinexhaustible source of energy and utilize it for whatever purpose one desired.Additionally, Bohm’s remarks also suggest that finding this frequency would alsobe a step on the road to the manipulation of gravity itself.Bohm, moreover, clearly sees this implication of engineerability, for he seesthe clear implication of his view for the very “construction and constitution”of matter itself. Indeed, he even goes so far as to give an approximation of thevery frequency that constitutes the “Bohm wavelength”!When this length is estimated it turns out to be about 10-33 cm. This is muchshorter than anything thus far probed in physical experiments (which have gotdown to about 10-17 cm or so). If one computes the amount of energy that wouldbe in one cubic centimetre of space, with this shortest possible wavelength, itturns out to be very far beyond the total energy of all the matter in the knownuniverse.What is implied by this proposal is that what we call empty space contains animmense background of energy, and that matter as we know it is a small,“quantized” wavelike excitation on top of this background, rather like a tinyripple on a vast sea.396 [4372.xhtml#4142]Before pondering the implications of all this further, it is worth citing Bohmon the awesome power implied in such a view:It is being suggested here, then, that what we perceive through the senses asempty space is actually the plenum, which is the ground for the existence ofeverything, including ourselves. The things that appear to our senses arederivative forms and their true meaning can be seen only when we consider theplenum, in which they are generated and sustained, and into which they mustultimately vanish.…In our approach (the) “big bang” is to be regarded as actually just a “littleripple.” An interesting image is obtained by considering that in the middle ofthe actual ocean (i.e., on the surface of the Earth) myriads of small wavesoccasionally come together fortuitously with such phase relationships that theyend up in a certain small region of space, suddenly to produce a very high wavewhich just appears as if from nowhere and out of nothing. Perhaps something likethis could happen in the immense ocean of cosmic energy, creating a sudden wavepulse, from which our “universe” would be born.397 [4372.xhtml#4144]Observe quite carefully what Bohm has just stated, for it is crucial to all thatfollows: matter itself, in all its variegated forms, is the result of aninterferometry — of the “mixing” — of several waves of various wavelengths, allof them in turn harmonics or overtones of the “Bohm wavelength.” It is the verytechnology of the creation ex nihilo, of the ability of the physical medium tocreate information and systems by wave-mixing. It is the technology of creationfrom nothing: alchemy. And there is one final consequence of Bohm’s views, andthat is that in order to give relative system stability to such waves, or ratherto the systems that such waves generate, the easiest way to do so is viarotation.A consequence inevitably follows from this view, and that is that rotatingmaterial systems — whether stars or particles — are thus natural resonators ofsuch waves, and hence to understand the pattern of interference of such waves,one had therefore to monitor the geometrical positions of significant objects inlocal space-time. In short, Bohm, with his view that matter is a “portal” and aglimpse into this higher-dimensional reality and its energies, has provided arationale for two things: the ancient preoccupation with astrology, and theancient preoccupation with alchemy, for both are manifestations of one and thesame physics. Matter, to put it succinctly, is but a standing wave ofinterferometry of other waves; matter itself is a grid or template ofinterference of such waves. This forms the link to alchemy, for as such, matteremerges as information within the field of the physical medium. To put itsuccinctly, matter is mutable, or in the language of alchemy, transmutable,since the physical medium itself, the Philosophers’ Stone par excellence,transmutes itself into the diversity of the material creation. This idea ofmatter as a template of the interferometry of such waves will play a key rolewhen we turn to examine the placement of sacred temples along a certain earthgrid in the next chapter, and an even more crucial role as a connecting concepttyping together all the disparate data points in this book upon its conclusion.b. The Foundation for the Study of Cycles Notices a Similar ThingOddly enough, the Foundation for the Study of Cycles noticed a very similarthing. We have already encountered the fact that the Foundation’s founder,Edward Dewey, compared the many cycles in its database to wave forms, andnoticed the fact that various waves of cycles could be “averaged” together, likesound waves.Ray Tomes, a member of the Foundation, wrote an interesting paper presented atthe Foundation’s February 1990 conference. The paper’s title is pregnant withimplications: “Towards a Unified Theory of Cycles.” In it, Tomes pursues Dewey’sand Dakin’s sound wave analogy to a breathtaking conclusion:Eventually I realised that the pattern of frequencies present in … corn priceswas the same as the arrangement of frequencies of the white notes on a piano…This was peculiar, and going back to my early common economic cycles study Irealised that the ratios 4:5:6:8 were exactly those of a major chord in music!Why are economic series playing major chords and scales in very slow motion?Research showed that such patterns had been observed and reported before byseveral contributors to Cycles magazine.398 [4372.xhtml#4146] One of these wasD.S. Castle (1956) who found that stock market cycles fit the musical scale. Thepattern found ranged over three octaves, and all seven white notes plus oneblack note were present in at least one octave.399 [4372.xhtml#4148]Tomes’ suggestion, in other words, is simply one and the same as that of DavidBohm, namely, that one might find “the ultimate wavelength” or frequency of alltypes of cycles of which all others are but harmonics or derivations from it.c. The Well-Tempered Clavier: The First Physical UnificationThe suggestion is not as far removed from physical reality as it might at firstseem, for the modern Western musical scale with its 12 equidistant “notes” arein fact the example of the first unification in physics. In order to see how,one may perform a simple exercise. If one sits at an acoustic piano and silentlypresses the note “C,” and then hits the same note “C” an octave lower, one willhear the strings of the silently pressed note vibrating sympathetically with thestruck note. The reason is simplicity itself. Each string on the piano vibratesnot only with the entire length of the string, but simultaneously also vibratesin various fractions of that length. Thus, each note has an “overtone” or“harmonic” series of notes. Therefore, one can then press silently the next notein “C’s” harmonic series, the note “G,” and hit the same “C” as before. Onceagain, one will hear the silently pressed note “G” vibrating sympatheticallywith the struck “C.” The next note in the harmonic series above “G” is again thenote “C,” then the note “E,” and so on. If one is sitting at the piano keyboardperforming this simple experiment, one will notice that the intervals of eachharmonic overtone of the original “C” are growing shorter, first the octave (thefirst silently pressed “C”), then a fifth, the note “G,” then again another “C”above that, which is a fourth, then the note “E,” which is a third, and so on.But eventually one will arrive, in the naturally occurring harmonic series, at anote that lies somewhere in the “crack” between the notes “A” and “B flat” onthe piano keyboard.But why does the piano (or any other keyboard instrument, for that matter) nothave that note? The answer is simple. If that note were present, then it wouldbe impossible to play a piece that continually changed keys. One would only beable to play a very limited series of chords. To change keys from, say, “C” to“D,” one would literally have to stop and retune the whole keyboard. So what hashappened?What happened was that between the stylistic change in music between theRenaissance and the Baroque, musicians learned to “tweak” the harmonic series,to tamper with it, or, as they liked to say, to “temper” it, by a slightmathematical adjustment of the natural overtone series, that would in turncreate 12 equidistant notes, each one a harmonic of all others, and thus musiccould change through as many keys as it wished in the course of a piece, withouthaving to stop and retune the whole instrument. In this way, each harmonicseries of each note on the keyboard, which originally and naturally did notoverlap completely, were engineered to do so, and thus were unified.400[4372.xhtml#4150]In short, and bearing this analogy in mind, what physicist David Bohm isactually suggesting, as a way forward into the deeper physics of engineering themedium itself, is that there is a frequency of which all others — from sound toelectromagnetic waves even to gravitational waves — are harmonics. He isproposing, in effect, a very ancient idea, that of the music of the spheres, awell-tempered clavier of the universe itself. He is proposing a modern physicsanalogue to the “lost word” and “lost chord” of esoteric lore.d. Nikolai Kozyrev’s Causal Mechanics and Precursor EngineeringIf David Bohm clearly implied a direct engineerability of the physical mediumalong the lines of a “well-tempered” harmonic unification of physics, thenRussian astrophysicist Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev went one step further by implying theability to engineer not effects, but causes directly.Such an ability implies that Kozyrev had a rather more unconventional view oftime than does standard physics. For Kozyrev, time was not a mere duration, apassive stage on which physical events were enacted;401 [4372.xhtml#4152]rather, time itself was an actor on the stage that, like space, had amulti-dimensional character and quality. An analogy will be useful to illustratethis point. Ordinarily physics tends to think of time in terms of the future,the present, and the past, i.e., as simple duration.402 [4372.xhtml#4154] Buthuman natural languages view time in a much subtler, deeper, and “qualitative”sense, with a variety of verb tenses and voices: future perfect, pluperfect,past perfect, active and passive voices, and so on. In a sense, naturallanguages therefore view time and the correlations between systems in a muchdeeper and more sophisticated manner than does physics.It was this subtlety that Kozyrev intended to explore, and to render into theformally explicit language of mathematics. This complexity and subtlety ofinterrelationships Kozyrev located in the “rotation moment” of a given system,that is, the subtleties of time and of the interactions of systems could bemodeled as a series of interlocking, and interfering, systems of rotation, or“dynamic torsion.”403 [4372.xhtml#4156] Time itself could impart its ownintensity — Kozyrev’s word for “compression,” implying its opposite, rarefaction— to a system, as well as impart a spin orientation to a system.404[4372.xhtml#4158] Through a series of extremely subtle experiments withgyroscopes, balances, and in some cases, even telescopes, Kozyrev was able todetermine that prior to the inception of any physical action, a kind of“pre-action” would be recorded by his measuring equipment, almost as if theequipment was “anticipating” the physical action itself.405 [4372.xhtml#4160]“Cause” and “effect” were therefore themselves the result of a lower-dimensionalfracture or breaking of a higher-dimensional unity and symmetry, much likeBohm’s projection analogy. By noting the temporal conditions under which these“pre-actions” or “precursors” occurred, one could eventually engineer theprecursors to any physical action.Thus, bearing in mind Kozyrev’s “precursor engineering,” and to return to Bohm’sanalysis of matter itself as a set of waves in the medium that are interferedupon one another, producing what Dewey and Dakin would call an “averaged” wave,then one may imagine a horrific possibility, namely, the exact mirror image ofsuch a wave which, interfered upon the original, would sum to zero, or exactlycancel it out, making the “something” a nothing again. The ultimate in“precursor” engineering was the power to erase an effect of a physical actionaltogether, by eradicating its cause.Furthermore, Bohm’s and Kozryev’s deeper physics behind the apparentlystochastic processes of quantum mechanics implies a similar deeper physicsbehind the apparently stochastic processes of econophysics as well. Indeed, ifone can, pace Kozyrev, engineer the precursors of effects — if one can actuallyengineer causes — then this implies that one could indeed engineer theprecursors of economic activity, since the means to do so, direct engineering ofthe physical medium itself, is implied in both cases.Consequently, one now has a speculative basis upon which to advance the reasonsfor the close association of the banking class throughout history with thetemple, that is to say, with that element or class within human society that hasat least some grasp on this deeper physics: banking is in effect an alchemicaloperation of creating information out of nothing, in this case the informationof credit and debt, for the latter is but a dim and pale technologicalreflection in the realm of finance of the analogous, but deeper, operations inphysics. And it is similarly likely that this relationship was formed preciselyso that by utilizing the latter, the former technology and deeper physics mightultimately be recovered. In short, were such a physics to be recovered, analliance with as many temple priesthoods was altogether necessary, for each mostlikely preserved some fragment of it, which when appropriately assembled wouldbe once more accessible. It provides also a rationale for their obsessiveinterest, since ancient times, in “world unification and domination,” for on theone hand, it is likely that vast financial resources — resources transcendingthe wealth of any one civilization in ancient or modern times — would be neededto reconstruct such a deeper physics, and on the other hand, a world extent isneeded in order to maintain the suppression of any independent development orrecovery of such a technology by potential rivals."},{"pageContent":"B. ECONOMICS, ASTROLOGY, AND ASTROPHYSICSThere are two streams of data that now converge to exhibit a probable deeperphysics to economic activity: on the one hand, the vast database of wave-likeforms from the Foundation for the Study of Cycles, and on the other, theimplications of David Bohm’s implicate order, where matter itself is the result,and hence a natural resonator, of such waves. As noted in chapter two, one ofthe implications of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles’ database was thateconomic cycles, precisely because they seemed to have some sort of underlyingphysics basis — recall Dewey’s and Dakin’s sound wave analogy once again — wereto that extent and in a certain sense “beyond the total rule of man’s consciouswill.”406 [4372.xhtml#4162] But there is another kind of database that Dewey andDakin did not consult, but it too suggests a profoundly deep physics to economicactivity.And that database is astrology.Astrologers have, of course, been casting “mundane horoscopes” for variousnations for decades, if not centuries and millennia, and more recently, manyhave noticed the odd correlations of certain recurrent planetary alignments andperiods of economic boom or bust. One to do so is Robert Gover in a recent, andfascinating, book called Time and Money: The Economy and the Planets. He beginsby noting the fact that Saturn orbits the sun every 28-30 earth years, Uranus 84years, Neptune 165 years, and Pluto 248 years.407 [4372.xhtml#4164] He thennotes the importance of these outer planets for astrological economicobservation: since the other planets — Jupiter, Mars, the Earth, Venus, andMercury — all move too rapidly around the Sun, they cannot be used “to markyears or decades of major economic cycles.”408 [4372.xhtml#4166] He then stateshis main thesis, one more or less well-known to astrologers, but not well-knownoutside such circles:Every time the USA has gone through a great depression, the outermost, slowestmoving planets have formed what astrologers call a grand cross with the USA’snatal Sun and Saturn. Every time Uranus has returned to early Gemini where itwas when the USA was “born” July 4, 1776, America has experienced its worstwars. Every time Uranus and Pluto have moved into conjunctions or 90-degreesquares and simultaneously come conjunct, opposite of square sensitive points inthe U.S. birth chart, America has experienced social changes or upheavals….Other wars occur when the U.S. natal Uranus is “afflicted” by transitingplanets, as happened when the World Trade Center and Pentagon were attacked.Saturn and Pluto form 180-degree oppositions three times a century, the latestbeing in effect on September 11, 2001;. The previous Saturn-Pluto oppositioncoincided with the tempestuous period we now call the Sixties, the one beforethat with what we now call The Great Depression.409 [4372.xhtml#4168]Gover then explains what four of the most significant conjunctions or alignmentsare. We shall focus on only two of them:A Grand Cross aspect is created when four planets form simultaneous squares andoppositions to each other. This is a rare aspect which brings obstructions,tensions, frustrations, i.e. a grand cross to the U.S. Sun-Saturn square hasformed each time the USA has fallen into a great depression.A Grand Trine aspect is also rare, and is formed by a triangle of three planets120 degrees from each other, creating harmonious flows of energy, good fortuneand opportunities.410 [4372.xhtml#4170]It is odd that the Grand Cross conjunction bears such a strange resemblance tothe planetary positions charts of RCA engineer Nelson.Grand Crosses form such a common feature to U.S. depressions that Gover actuallyformulates it as a kind of astrological law: “No grand cross, no greatdepression.”411 [4372.xhtml#4172] However, Gover notes that in this respect,astrological “prediction” is not to be misconstrued:If we view the planets around us in our solar system as a huge celestial clock,the first thing history teaches us is that the celestial clock is notmechanically precise like our earthly clocks. Although we can discern fromhistory when like economic events are due, clock-like prediction isn’t possible.Certain planetary patterns create seasons when certain types of events can beexpected. But the planets cannot tell us specifically how events will unfold,nor how we will respond. We know when winter is nigh but not how cold it willget. Some hurricane seasons bring great devastation, others are less severe .412[4372.xhtml#4174]With this said, a glance at Gover’s charts is in order.The first American Great Depression occurred in the 1780s. His chart looks likethis:[5763.jpeg]Robert Gover’s Astrological Chart for the American Great Depression of the1780s413 [4372.xhtml#4176]If one takes the time to decipher the planetary symbols, then one finds “Saturnwas at 15 degrees Capricorn which puts it opposite the U.S. natal Sun at 13Cancer; meanwhile, Mars at 21 Aries is within orb or an opposition to (theU.S.A.’s) natal Saturn at 15 degrees of Libra.”414 [4372.xhtml#4178] In short, aGrand Cross was formed between the planetary positions during the 1780s greatdepression, and that of their positions at the time of the U.S.A.’s birth.Similarly, a Grand Cross is formed during the Great Depression of the 1870s.[5764.jpeg]Robert Gover’s Astrological Chart for the American Great Depression of the1870s415 [4372.xhtml#4180]During this time “Saturn in Capricorn formed a square with Neptune in Aries tocreate the grand cross with (the U.S.A.’s) Sun and Saturn.”416 [4372.xhtml#4182]Finally, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, yet another Grand Cross wasformed:[5765.jpeg]Robert Gover’s Astrological Chart for the American Great Depression of the1930s417 [4372.xhtml#4184]This chart chows a Grand Cross between Saturn, at 13 degrees Capricorn squarewith Uranus at 11 degrees Aries, and opposite (i.e., at 180 degrees) with theU.S.A.’s natal Sun and Saturn.418 [4372.xhtml#4186]That these Grand Crosses have a malign influence would seem, at least as a primafacie case, to be a given. But is there any real-world physics correlation?The answer to this question is as easy as reproducing one of Nelson’s chartsfrom his RCA study of planetary alignments and radio signal propagation.[5766.jpeg]Nelson’s Chart of Venus-Jupiter Opposition419 [4372.xhtml#4188]Note the similarity is once again that planets, in this case the inner planets,are in certain relationships to each other, relations of 90 degrees or someharmonic thereof, i.e., 180 or 270 degrees.420 [4372.xhtml#4190]Thus, if the Foundation for the Study of Cycles’ database and Gover’s (and otherastrologers’) charts are any indicator, then we can now draw even closer to anunderstanding of the relationship that was seen to exist between banking and thetemple in ancient times, for the astrological data of economic boom and bustwould have been known by them from ancient times, and it would have been crucialfor the “financial powers in the know” to have such data available, in order toexacerbate or damp the overall trend of boom or bust within a cycle.With this in mind, a glance at the evidence gathered by Ellen Hodgson Brown,whose book was mentioned in the Prologue, is in order, for a comparison of theactivities of banksters relative to Gover’s astrological charts is quiterevealing."},{"pageContent":"C. ELLEN HODGSON BROWN"},{"pageContent":"1. The Depression of the 1780s and the BankstersBrown points out something that most modern Americans do not know, and that is,that prior to the American Revolution, most of the colonies printed their ownpaper money — debt-free — and actually made loans to farmers and businessmen.The result was a booming economy and almost full employment. When BenjaminFranklin went to England prior to the revolution, he was asked about the sourceof this prosperity “by the directors of the Bank of England,” and Franklinresponded that the colonies “issued paper money ‘in proper proportion to thedemands of trade and industry.’”421 [4372.xhtml#4192] But what was the “backing”of this money? The colonies, however, had little silver and gold with which toback their issues of paper currency. With what, then, was it backed? The thenfamous Protestant minister in New England, Cotton Mather, made clear what thebacking of this colonial scrip was by asking a pointed series of questions:Is a Bond or Bill of Exchange for (one thousand pounds), other than paper? Andyet it is not as valuable as so much Silver or Gold, supposing the security ofPayment is sufficient? Now what is the security of your Paper-money less thanthe Credit of the whole Country?422 [4372.xhtml#4194]As Brown notes, “Mather had redefined money. What it represented was not a sumof gold or silver. It was credit: ‘the credit of the whole country.’”423[4372.xhtml#4196] Within the context of the evidence presented thus far, and inparticular, the analysis of David Astle reviewed in chapter five, what Matherhad really done is return to the very ancient conception of money prior to therise of the international bankster class of bullion brokers in ancient times;what he had done was to return to the idea of money as a credit bill against thesurpluses of the state warehouse, and not an interest-bearing note of privateissuance.Franklin stated this conception somewhat differently: “The riches of a countryare to be valued by the quantity of labor its inhabitants are able to purchaseand not by the quantity of gold and silver they possess.”424 [4372.xhtml#4198]The difference is striking, forwhen gold was the medium of exchange, money determined production rather thanproduction determining the money supply. When gold was plentiful, things gotproduced. When it was scarce, men were out of work and people knew want. Thevirtue of government-issued paper scrip was that it could grow along withproductivity, allowing potential to become real wealth.425 [4372.xhtml#4200]Franklin elaborated on the source of colonial prosperity to his English hosts,and his words are worth taking to heart, for in them one discerns the cleardifference between a closed system of “debt-as-money” or monetized debt, and anopen system of money as a medium of exchange of production and credit:In the colonies we issue our own money. It is called Colonial Scrip. We issue itto pay the government’s approved expenses and charities. We make sure it isissued in proper proportions to make the goods pass easily from the producers tothe consumers…. In this manner, creating for ourselves our own paper money, wecontrol its purchasing power, and we have no interest to pay to anyone. You see,a legitimate government can both spend and lend money into circulation, whilebanks can only lend significant amounts of their promissory bank notes, for theycan neither give away nor spend but a tiny fraction of the money people need.Thus, when your banks here in England place money in circulation, there isalways a debt principal to be returned and usury to be paid. The result is thatyou have always too little credit in circulation to give the workers fullemployment. You do not have too many workers, you have too little money incirculation, and that which circulates, all bears the endless burden ofunpayable debt and usury.426 [4372.xhtml#4202]Franklin has seen the essential criminality and fraud that is central banking,for the governments pursuing a policy of “monetizing the debt” only means thatthey are beholden to a private monopoly, which issues “debt as money,” whereasthe colonial experience — and the very ancient experience — was that true moneywas credit on the productive surplus of the state, and hence, only the statecould issue it.Needless to say, England’s banksters were not about to allow this situation tocontinue, allowing the colonists to gain prosperity without enriching their ownparasitic coffers. Thus, the Bank of England parlayed its influence inParliament to get the 1764 Currency Act passed, which made it illegal for thecolonies to issue their own money. And predictably, as Franklin observed, a yearlater the streets of the colonies were filled with the unemployed andbeggars.427 [4372.xhtml#4204] And it was this substitution of debt as money, thereplacement of real money by the facsimile of money that, according to Franklin,was the real cause of the Revolution.428 [4372.xhtml#4206]When the Revolutionary War finally came, the Continental Congress financed theentire endeavor by once again resorting to the expedient of issuing its ownpaper scrip as a circulating debt note of the state to be redeemed by coinage ata future date.429 [4372.xhtml#4208] Of course, the Continental Congress issuedtoo much of this scrip, some two hundred million dollars’ worth, so that by theconclusion of the Revolutionary War, the scrip was basically worthless.But the real lesson was not in the dangers of a state hyper-inflating itsstate-issued credit notes. The real lesson was that the Continental Congress’scripStill evoked the wonder and admiration of foreign observers, because it allowedthe colonists to do something that had never been done before. They succeeded infinancing a war against a major power, with virtually no “hard” currency oftheir own, without taxing the people. Franklin wrote…during the war, “the wholeis a mystery even the politicians, how we could pay with paper that had nopreviously fixed fund appropriated specifically to redeem it. This currency aswe manage it is a wonderful machine. Thomas Paine called it a “corner stone” ofthe Revolution: “Every stone in the Bridge, that has carried us over, seems tohave claim upon our esteem. But this was a corner stone, and its usefulnesscannot be forgotten.”430 [4372.xhtml#4210]Alas, it is a lesson the American people and the two political parties thatsupposedly “represent” them seems all but forgotten in modern times.Of course, the British were fully aware of how their rebellious colonies werefunding their Revolution, and purposed to crash the currency by the time-testedtactic of counterfeiting. One British general cited by Brown in her book notedthat every art of counterfeiting had been tried, but, to his chagrin, “still thecurrency has not failed.”431 [4372.xhtml#4212] It was only after the successfulRevolution that the Continental Scrip failed, as the very same Founding Fathersgrew understandably disillusioned with the resulting devaluation that inflationof the supply — not to mention the counterfeit scrip in circulation — caused.The result of this deliberate speculation against the American Continental Scripwas predictable, for the Founding Fathers rebelled against the very papermoney-as-credit against the state’s future productive surplus after the war bystating that Congress had the power to make “and coin” money. In other words,the Continental Congress had fallen into the old trap of the issuance of thefacsimile of money, of money as debt, even if that debt were the credit againsta future surplus of the state.The notes represented debt, and the debt had now come due. The bearers expectedto get their gold, and the gold was not to be had. There was insufficient supplyof money for conducting trade. Tightening the money supply by limiting it tocoins had quickly precipitated another depression. In 1786, a farmers’ rebellionbroke out in Massachusetts, led by Daniel Shays. Farmers brandishing pitchforkscomplained of going heavily into debt when paper money was plentiful. When itwas no longer available and debts had to be repaid in the much scarcer “hard”coin of the British bankers, some farmer lost their farms.432 [4372.xhtml#4214]The immediate result of this First American “Great Depression” then, was ofcourse the call for a stronger central government and a means for it to create“an expandable money supply,” and the convocation of the assembly thateventually led to the draft of the current American Constitution.433[4372.xhtml#4216]At this juncture, it is worth citing Ellen Brown’s comments extensively:The solution of Treasury Secretary Hamilton was to “monetize” the national debt,by turning it into a source of money for the country. He proposed that anational bank be authorized to print up banknotes and swap them for thegovernment’s bonds. The government would pay regular interest on the debt, usingimport duties and money from the sale of public land. Opponents said thatacknowledging the government’s debt at face value would unfairly reward thespeculators who had bought up the country’s I.O.U.s for a pittance from thesoldiers, farmers and small businessmen who had actually earned them; butHamilton argued that the speculators had earned this windfall for their “faithin the country.” He thought the government needed to enlist the support of thespeculators, or they would do to the new country’s money what they had done tothe Continental….Jefferson, Hamilton’s chief political opponent, feared that giving privatewealthy citizens an ownership interest in the bank would link their intereststoo closely within it. The government would be turned into an oligarchy, agovernment of the rich at war with the working classes. A bank owned by privatestockholders, whose driving motive was profit, would be less likely to beresponsive to the needs of the public than one that was owned by the public andsubject to public oversight. Stockholders of a private bank would make theirfinancial decisions behind closed doors, without public knowledge or control.But Hamilton’s plan had other strategic advantages, and it won the day. Besidesneatly disposing of a crippling federal debt and winning over the “men ofwealth,” it secured the loyalty of the individual States by making their debtstoo exchangeable for stock in the new Bank. The move was controversial; but bystabilizing the States’ shaky finances, Hamilton got the States on board,thwarting the plans of the pro-British faction that hoped to split them up andestablish a Northern Confederacy.434 [4372.xhtml#4218]It is worth pausing at this juncture to observe, in the context of Gover’sastrological chart of the Great Depression of the 1780s, what we have:1. The Continental Congress’ scrip was essentially not the same thing asColonial scrip, in that it was debt money issued against a future promise topay, some of which was a promise to pay in bullion which the colonies did nothave in abundance. Hence, the Continental Scrip inevitably opened itself tospeculation and counterfeiting by the very European and British banksters whoheld a virtual monopoly on bullion supplies;2. The inevitable result, as the value of the Continental plunged after theRevolution and the money supply contracted to reflect the scarce bullion supply,was that the post-Revolutionary states could not pay their debt, and aninevitable depression occurred as the supply of money contracted and privatedebt-holders were not able to service that debt;3. the result of this sequence of events led to the calling of theConstitutional convention, the formulation of the current Americanconstitutional system, and the first chartered private central bank of theUnited States which issued the facsimile of money based on monetized debt;4. The alternative fear, which Hamilton voiced, was that “private speculators”would manipulate any new American currency via speculation and counterfeiting,driving it to similar worthlessness, and splitting the new American nation ifthey themselves were not given some stake in the new currency as a vested classinterest.In short, almost from the beginning of the current constitutional system ofAmerica, an uneasy compromise — a détente — was struck with the banksters toallow the new nation to survive, and enrich that class in the process. Andduring all this period, as Gover noted, the planets were in certain alignments…."},{"pageContent":"2. The Depression of the 1870s and the BankstersThe American depression of the 1870s again followed yet another war in Americanhistory, the War Between the States. And like the American Revolution, at leastone of the leaders of the belligerent parties, as is now well-known, chose tofinance his side of the war by issuing state-created debt-free money, i.e.,money as credit on the productive output of the nation. His name, of course, wasAbraham Lincoln, and the fiscal lessons of his presidency and its immediateaftermath are once again worth rehearsing in some detail.German Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck wrote a curious thing in 1876 about thefiscal policies of the Lincoln Administration:I know of absolute certainty, that the division of the United States intofederations of equal force was decided long before the Civil War by the highfinancial powers of Europe. These bankers were afraid that the United States, ifthey remained in one block and as one nation, would attain economic andfinancial independence, which would upset their financial domination over Europeand the world. Of course, in the ‘inner circle’ of Finance, the voice of theRothschilds prevailed. They saw an opportunity for prodigious booty if theycould substitute two feeble democracies burdened with debt to the financiers… inplace of a vigorous Republic sufficient unto herself. Therefore, they sent theiremissaries into the field to exploit the question of slavery and to drive awedge between the two parts of the Union…. The rupture between the North and theSouth became inevitable; the masters of European finance employed all theirforces to bring it about and to turn it to their advantage.435 [4372.xhtml#4220]There was just one problem. President Lincoln refused to go into debt to theprivate class of banksters to fund the Northern effort in the Civil War.Chancellor Bismarck’s comment is worth citing:The Government and the nation escaped the plots of the foreign financiers. Theyunderstood at once, that the United States would escape their grip. The death ofLincoln was resolved upon.436 [4372.xhtml#4222]Bismarck, in other words, in his customary direct way, was simply stating thatthe “inner circle of European financiers” led by the Rothschilds had had Lincolnmurdered as a punishment and message to those who dare presume to challengetheir power.While Lincoln was busily issuing his Greenback debt-free scrip, however, thebanksters were busily hatching a scheme of their own in Congress through theirown faction. Once again, it is essential to cite Ellen Brown extensively inorder to appreciate what the scam was, and how it was effected:While one faction in Congress was busy getting the Greenbacks issued to fund thewar, another faction was preparing a National Banking Act that would deliver amonopoly over the power to create the nation’s money supply to the Wall Streetbankers and their European affiliates. The National Banking Act was promoted asestablishing safeguards for the new national banking system; but while it was animportant first step toward a truly national bank, it was only a compromise withthe bankers, and buried in the fine print, it gave them exactly what theywanted. A private communication from a Rothschild investment house in London toan associate banking firm in New York dated June 25, 1863, confided:“The few who understand the system will either be so interested in its profitsor so dependent upon its favors that there will be no opposition from thatclass, while, on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable ofcomprehending… will bear its burdens without complaint.”The Act looked good on its face. It established a Comptroller of the Currency,whose authority was required before a National Banking Association could startbusiness. It laid down regulations covering minimum capitalization, reserverequirements, bad debts, and reporting. The Comptroller could at any timeappoint investigators to look into the affairs of any national bank. Every bankdirector had to be an American citizen, and three-quarters of the directors hadto be residents of the state in which the bank did business. Interest rates werelimited by State usury laws; and if no laws were in effect, then to 7 percent.Banks could not hold real estate for more than five years, except for bankbuildings. National banks were not allowed to circulate notes they printedthemselves. Instead, they had to deposit U.S. bonds with the Treasury in a sumequal to at least one-third of their capital. They got government-printed notesin return.So what was the problem? Although the new national banknotes were technicallyissued by the Comptroller of the Currency, this was just a formality, like theprinting of Federal Reserve Notes by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing today.The currency bore the name of the bank posting the bonds, and it was issued atthe bank’s request. In effect, the National Banking Act authorized the bankersto issue and lend their own paper money. The banks “deposited” the bonds withthe Treasury, but they still owned the bonds; and they immediately got theirmoney back in the form of their own banknotes. Topping it off, the NationalBanking Act effectively removed the competition to these banknotes. It imposed aheavy tax on the notes of the state-chartered banks, essentially abolishingthem. It also curtailed competition from the Greenbacks, which were limited tospecific issues while the bankers’ notes could be issued at will. TreasurySecretary Salmon P. Chase and others complained that the bankers were buying upthe Greenbacks with their own banknotes.437 [4372.xhtml#4224]In other words, what the National Banking Act really did was allow the banksterseffectively to outproduce the government Greenbacks in issues of their owndebt-bearing banknotes, which the banksters then used to buy Greenbacks and takethem out of circulation!The banksters followed this up in 1873 with the so-called Act that became knownpopularly as the “Crime of ’73,” an act which effectively forbade the coinage ofsilver as legal tender, effectively placing America on the gold standard onceagain. Predictably, the Act led to a vastly shrunken money supply, unemployment,and the Depression of the 1870s. The result was similar to thebankster-engineered Depression of the 1780s, for it led to a political “revolt”of powerful farmers who formed the appropriately named Greenback Party, callingfor the issuance of state-created debt-free money directly, which money was tobe used putting people back to work improving the infrastructure of thecountry.438 [4372.xhtml#4226] While the Greenbacks never succeeded in placing anational candidate of their own into the White House, their message was heard,and in 1881 James Garfield became President of the United States of America.Garfield proclaimed:Whosoever controls the volume of money in any country is the absolute master ofall industry and commerce…And when you realize that the entire system is veryeasily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, youwill not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.439[4372.xhtml#4228]As Brown notes, “Garfield was murdered not long after releasing this statement,when he was less than four months into his presidency.”440 [4372.xhtml#4230] Weshall have occasion to return to a consideration of President Garfield’s remarksin a moment, but for now, be it noted, that he has clearly insinuated that thecycles of boom and bust are artificially created by the banksters, whereas thecycles data assembled by Edward Dewey, and the astrological data assembled byGover, clearly indicate that such things appear to have much deeper causes thanjust human actions, and are, to a certain extent, inevitable. So….what is reallygoing on?A hint is perhaps gained by the fact that1. in the cases of both depressions examined thus far, both occurred after amajor war; and,2. both occurred after the government in each case decided to fund the war byissuance of debt-free money, bypassing the banksters completely; and,3. the banksters retaliated against that currency by unleashing various forms ofspeculation and manipulation against it, through counterfeiting, or by otherwiseremoving the government’s currency from circulation; and4. in each instance thus far, this resulted in the deliberate tightening of themoney supply and a corresponding loss of jobs, production, and an economicdepression.These patterns reach the nadir of their expression in the greatest Depression ofthem all, the Great Depression of the 1930s."},{"pageContent":"3. The Great Depression of the 1930s and the BankstersBy the time of the Great Depression, the great struggle between the federalgovernment of the United States of America and the private banksters had finallybeen won by the latter with the creation of the privately owned Federal ReserveBank in 1913, and its thinly-disguised police force agency, the Internal RevenueService, the agency responsible for gathering the newly created federal incometax that was designed specifically to pay the regular interest payments to thebanksters loaning money at interest to the government. Then began thedeliberately and quietly orchestrated run-up to the Great Depression:The problem began in the Roaring Twenties, when the Fed made money plentiful bykeeping interest rates low. Money seemed to be plentiful, but what was actuallyflowing freely was “credit” or “debt.” Production was up more than wages wereup, so more goods were available than the money to pay for them; but peoplecould borrow. By the end of the 1920s, major consumer purchases such as cars andradios (which were then large pieces of furniture that sat on the floor) werebought mainly on credit. Money was so easy to get that people were borrowingjust to invest, taking out short-term, low-interest loans that were readilyavailable from the banks.The stock market held little interest for most people until the Robber Baronsstarted promoting it, after amassing large stock holdings very cheaplythemselves. They sold the public on the idea that it was possible to get richquick by buying stock on “margin” (or on credit). The investor could put a downpayment on the stock and pay off the balance after its price went up, reaping ahefty profit. This investment strategy turned the stock market into aspeculative pyramid scheme, in which most of the money invested did not actuallyexist…. The public went wild over this scheme. In a speculative fever, manypeople literally “bet the farm.”… Homesteads that had been owned free and clearwere mortgaged to the bankers, who fanned the fever by offering favorable creditterms and interest rates. The Federal Reserve made these favorable termspossible by substantially lowering the discount rate — the interest rate memberbanks paid to borrow from the Fed. The Fed thus made it easy for the banks toacquire additional reserves, against which they could expand the money supply bymany multiples with loans.441 [4372.xhtml#4232]But why, asks Ellen Brown, would the Federal Reserve want to swamp the U.S.economy with an inflated supply of borrowed “dollars” of Federal Reserve notes?The answer is chilling.“The evidence,” says Brown, “points to a scheme between Benjamin Strong, thenGovernor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Montagu Norman, head ofthe Bank of England, to deliver control of the financial systems of the world toa small group of private central bankers.”442 [4372.xhtml#4234] The reason,according to Dr. Carroll Quigley of the Georgetown School of InternationalRelations, and himself an “insider” with access to the banksters’ plans, wasthat during the 1920s, the privately-owned central banks were determined “to usethe financial power of Britain and the United States to force all the majorcountries of the world to go on the gold standard and to operate it throughcentral banks free from all political control…”443 [4372.xhtml#4236] In otherwords, the scheme, by forcing money to be a reflection of the world’s goldsupplies, was one of drastically curtailing the amount of money in circulationas debt, thus setting off a Depression.The plan was indeed ingenious for its cold calculation and cunning:Norman, as head of the Bank of England, was determined to keep the British poundconvertible to gold at pre- [World War I] levels, although the pound had lostsubstantial value as against gold during World War I. The result was a majordrain of British gold reserves. To keep gold from flowing out of England intothe United States, the Federal Reserve, led by Strong, supported the Bank ofEngland by keeping U.S. interest rates low, inflating the U.S. dollar. Thehigher interest rates in London made it a more attractive place for investors toput their gold, drawing it from the United States to England; but the lowerrates in the United States caused an inflation bubble, which soon got out ofhand. The meetings between Norman and Strong were very secretive, but theevidence suggests that in February 1929, they concluded that a collapse in themarket was inevitable and that the best course was to let it correct “naturally”(naturally, that is, with a little help from the Fed). They sent advisorywarnings to lists of preferred customers…telling them to get out of the market.Then the Fed began selling government securities in the open market, reducingthe money supply by reducing the reserves available for backing them. Thebank-loan rate was also increased, causing rates on brokers’ loans to jump to 20percent.The result was a huge liquidity squeeze — a lack of available money. Short-termloans suddenly became available only at much higher interest rates, makingbuying stock on margin much less attractive. As fewer people bought, stockprices fell, removing the incentive for new buyers to purchase stocks bought byearlier buyers on margin. Many investors were forced to sell at a loss by“margin calls” (calls by brokers for investors to bring the cash in their marginaccounts up to a certain level after the value of their stocks had fallen). Thepanic was on, as investors rushed to dump their stocks for whatever they couldget for them. The stock market crashed overnight. People withdrew their savingsfrom the banks and foreigners withdrew their gold, further depleting thereserves on which the money stock was built….It was dramatic evidence of thedangers of delegating the power to control the money supply to a singleautocratic head of an autonomous agency.444 [4372.xhtml#4238]Once again, one has, if one compares this evidence with Gover, that as theplanets entered certain alignments, certain policies were pursued by thebanksters, first, to artificially inflate the money supply, extending easycredit and debt, and then suddenly contracting it, allowing stock prices tofall, and allowing the banksters to snap up real assets for a substantiallylower price.Of course, as all of this was going on, Herbert Hoover was President, and as wehave already seen, he quietly commissioned Commerce Department economist EdwardDewey to study the reasons for all these Depressions."},{"pageContent":"4. ImplicationsSo now let us return to the statements of President James Garfield citedpreviously, and to the questions they raised.Recall that he clearly insinuated that the cycles of boom and bust areartificially created by the banksters, whereas the cycles data assembled byEdward Dewey, and the astrological data assembled by Gover, clearly indicatethat such things appear to have much deeper causes than just human actions, andare, to a certain extent, inevitable. So….what is really going on? In each casethus far examined, as these planetary alignments were occurring, or, moreimportantly, as a glance at Dewey’s cyclic data would indicate, each downturn,and particularly that of the Great Depression of the 1930s, came at a momentwhen the data suggested that this was more or less inevitable, regardless ofwhat actions might have been taken by various governments or banksters.So let us now make two assumptions, based on the assembled data:1. The cyclic data of Dewey suggested that a downturn was inevitable preciselyduring the time of the 1930s Depression, and the cosmological data assembled byGover suggested a similar inevitability for other depressions in Americanhistory; and,2. The presence, since ancient times, of the close association between the“temple” with its astrological associations and the “banking class” continuedunabated into modern times, a point readily suggested by the presence ofeconomists of major banks in Dewey’s own Foundation. Gover’s astrological data,moreover, would be available to any astrologer capable of casting a mundanehoroscope, and hence, readily available to anyone so inclined to assemble suchcharts for comparison with the historical evidences of booms and busts invarious economies.Thus, one is led to an astonished, and rather breathtaking conclusion: it wouldappear that anyone in possession of such knowledge as Dewey’s cycles orastrological data similar to Gover’s would be in a position, through carefulpolicy manipulation and the contraction of a money supply based on the facsimileof money-as-circulating-debt, to dramatically exacerbate and capitalize on theoverall upward or downward trend of such a cycle. Moreover, this appears to beexactly what happened in the cases of the three great depressions in Americanhistory.The exact mechanism for these deeper physics influences on human behavior is nothere in view, however. It may be the case that certain alignments cause certaintypes of behavior to emerge in the aggregate, which in turn create conditionsapt to favor one policy or course of action over another. Or conversely, it maybe that certain types of influences block the aggregate ability of humans toperceive the subtle manipulations of these would-be master manipulators, whichother types of influences may magnify human perceptual abilities and discretion.We simply do not know how this works. But what we do know is that thisastrological component and its connection to the banking classes is as old asthe civilization with which astrology is associated: Babylon itself. It is anassociation as old as that of the ancient priesthoods and temples not only withthe stars, but with the bullion brokers. It is interesting to note, then, thatsome allege that the Rothschild family secretly traces its family dynasty backto the Sumerian tyrant Nimrod.445 [4372.xhtml#4240]"},{"pageContent":"D. IMPLICATIONS OF ENGINEERABILITY: THE ANCIENT ALCHEMICAL CONNECTIONAll this implies an “engineerability” to economic trends, even if one does notpossess the technology or means to engineer the physical medium or thus itscycles themselves, for if one possessed a sufficient database to know in advancethe inevitable cycles of boom and bust, one may not be able to reverse thosecycles, but one could considerably exacerbate or alleviate their overall effect.The keystone in the arch linking together all these disparate concepts —econophysics, astrology, astronomy, Bohm’s and Kozyrev’s precursor engineeringof causation itself, the bullion brokers, the ancient temples — is alchemy,which in its exoteric aspect is the ability to confect the Philosophers’ Stone,a substance that can turn base metals into gold, and in its esoteric aspect isthe ability to draw upon the transmutative, information-creating properties ofthe physical medium itself for the power to create or destroy. In its exotericaspect, therefore, it would be of immediate concern to the bullion brokers tocommand such a technology, to prevent any outside force or faction fromutilizing such a technology to collapse the artificially-created value of theirbullion, and hence ruining their private money-creating power. Similarly, itwould be of immediate interest to those wishing to break that bullion brokers’monopoly to command that technology. By the same token, the bullion brokers, bycontrolling the exoteric aspects of alchemy, would see in it a means to thevastly expanded powers of its esoteric aspect, the ability to manipulate andengineer the physical medium itself, thus including even the cycles of aggregatehuman behavior and activity. Once that power was restored to them, their irongrip on power would be complete.So notice the stages which have been observed throughout the previous chapters:1. In the first stage, the bullion brokers resort to a kind of false alchemy,i.e., the private creation of credit (and interest debt) by the fiction ofledger credit entry. This is the financiers’ alchemical charlatanism, forsomething has quite literally been created out of nothing, but that “something”only continues to be something of value so long as wider society accredits it assuch. It is not genuine information, for it is in fact, in its interest debtcreation, the creation of “negative information,” a black hole of financialentropy that inevitably must suck all creative production into it and letnothing escape; it is a financial cancer that inevitably will consume its host,creating its own death. Lose that confidence, and the value is gone. Thus, theway to sanctify and ensure that “negative value” was to associate their moneyminting and issuing activities with the sanctity and probity of the varioustemple priesthoods in each civilization;2. In the second stage, alchemy is pursued for its own sake, not only toincrease or expand the supply of bullion, but also to monopolize that technologylest the too-rapid increase of that supply ruin the value of theprivately-created money which they themselves have implemented. In short, theymust monopolize this technology lest their money monopoly be challenged by kingsintent upon restoring their crown prerogative of money issuance based upon thecreative production of their state and subjects. And in order to monopolize it,they must quite literally infiltrate every society and civilization whichappears likely to develop it. It is, perforce, and by the nature of the case, aninternational conspiracy, for it must have an international reach in order toensure that the economic system remains closed.3. In the third stage, which is always the ultimate goal, the bullion brokersseek to develop the highest alchemical technology of them all: the ability toengineer the physical medium and its cycles directly. Since alchemy in itsexoteric aspect is based upon its esoteric aspect, i.e., upon the idea of thephysical medium as an information-creating and transmutative medium, thistechnology too must likewise be monopolized, since any rival gaining access toit could successfully challenge their monopoly of money issuance and, moreimportantly, would have the power to overturn them by force if necessary.From Morgan’s suppression of Tesla, to Tesla’s own possible independent use ofhis wireless impulse transmitter technology in a weaponized fashion at Tunguska,to Nazi Germany’s restoration of state-created, debt-free money and to itsinvestigation of this deeper “torsion”-based physics with its Bell project, toancient Sparta’s and Rome’s attempts to restore economic autarchy and Rome’sburning of Egyptian alchemical books, the pattern is the same:Wherever there is a private monopoly on the creation of money, there too onefinds the inevitable and covert alliance with the temple of science, and amutual interest in the secret development of the deep alchemical physics of themedium, for that, far beyond the shadowy imitations of international banksterscreating ledger credit entries, is the ultimate power to create or destroy.That alliance with the temple gave the ancient bullion brokers yet another clueon the road to recovering the lost and unified physics: the placement of suchtemples on the surface of the Earth itself, and the repetitive occurrence withinthose structures of a sacred geometry known to its priests and initiates…"},{"pageContent":"III.THE MONSTERS IN THE MACHINE“In their drive to advance the global empire, corporations, banks, andgovernments (collectively the corporatocracy) use their financial and politicalmuscle to ensure that our schools, business, and media support both thefallacious concept and its corollary.

The process isperhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented… Ifyou want to be slaves of the bankers, and pay the cost of your own slavery, thenlet the banks create money.”— Lord Josiah Stemp, former Director of the Bank of England446 [4372.xhtml#4242]“The deep attitude of the global, mostly male, corporate gang was expressed byDavid Rockefeller at the June 1991 Bilderberg meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany,where he argued for ‘supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite andworld bankers, which is surely preferable to the national auto determinationpracticed in the past centuries.’”— Daniel Estulin, citing David Rockefeller447 [4372.xhtml#4244]There is little doubt that many ancient temples — from Giza to Stonehenge toTeotihuacan in Mexico — are aligned to astronomical phenomena or particularstars or constellations. However, it is equally true, as noted in chapter four,that many of these temples are aligned, or rather, situated, to something else,and that is their peculiar siting on the surface of planet Earth herself. Manyresearchers, noticing this peculiar placement, have been able to demonstratethat these sites, if viewed as a total system, constitute a kind of “gridwork”or imaginary lattice stretched across the face of the globe. Moreover, thesestructures, from the Great Pyramid of Giza to the Parthenon in Athens, to thevast and ancient pyramids of Mexico, appear to incorporate measures in theirdimensions comprising constants of a “sacred geometry.”Consequently, in order to grasp the intricate relationships of deep physics anddeep finance, one must go yet another step further, for if there was, as hasbeen already seen, a deep and ancient connection between the ancient temples,their priesthoods, and astrology on the one hand and the “bullion brokers” onthe other, and if, as has been argued, this connection evinced a hiddenmotivation on the part of the latter to know and manipulate the physics thisportended, then the alignment of these sites and temples, and indeed, their verydimensions, may form yet another clue and data point to be considered. Indeed,researcher Brian Desborough makes some astonishing assertions in this respect:Sacred geometry, which comprised the core teaching of any genuine Mystery Schoolof antiquity, was incorporated into the design of buildings that enabled them tofunction as resonant cavities, which were attuned to the dynamic energies thatpervade the cosmos. This is the same energy continuum that was harnessed sometwo thousand years later by Nikola Tesla and other scientific pioneers, whoelected to conduct their research beyond the stultifying confines of academia.The basic tenets of sacred geometry were taught in ancient Mystery Schools, incountries as geographically diverse as India, Britain, and Egypt. This stronglysuggests that such institutions functioned not as individual entities, butrather as a transnational network. Such a suggestion implies that the moreesoterically-oriented … sects operated not as individual religious communities,but were in communication with the Mystery Schools of other nations.448[4372.xhtml#4246]As has been seen, the rise of an international class of bullion brokers closelyassociated with such temples in ancient times provides a ready mechanism toexplain this transnational character of the Mystery Schools, and may have beeninstrumental in the dispersion of such ideas.More importantly, however, Desborough clearly alludes to an occulted physicspurpose that motivated the incorporation of these geometries into ancienttemples, for these were, in his words, designed to function as “resonantcavities” or, in a physicist’s language, as “coupled harmonic oscillators” tothose “dynamic energies that pervade the cosmos.” In this last statement,Desborough is correct, for as has also been seen, the deeper physics suggestedby Kozyrev and Bohm in the perpetual dynamism of the cosmos, with its rotatingsystems within rotating systems, implies that matter itself arises as a gridworkor interference pattern of the waves produced in the physical medium. As such,matter is a natural resonating cavity of such waves, and in certain geometricalalignments and dimensions, that resonance can conceivably be made to functionmore efficiently. Desborough’s insight is keen, but unfortunately, neitherargued nor substantiated.So inevitably the question occurs: is there such a gridwork of sites upon theEarth? And do temples in fact evidence a geometry in their very constructionthat would enable them to function as such resonators?"},{"pageContent":"A. THE MODERN RISE OF EARTH GRID THEORIES"},{"pageContent":"1. Ivan SandersonOne does not have to read too far into the area of Earth Grid theories to find averitable overgrowth of wild speculations and fanciful ideas. But the actualmodern growth of the theory may best be attributed to the scientific research ofsome Russian chemists, and a Western scientist interested in “anomalousphenomena,” the famous Fortean researcher Ivan Sanderson. Sanderson was in facta professional biologist by academic training and background. But in 1972 hepublished an article for Saga magazine entitled “The Twelve Devil’s GraveyardsAround the World.”What Sanderson did was to compile a database of “Bermuda Triangle”-likephenomena of ship and plane disappearances worldwide, and, using moderntechniques of communications and geophysical tabulation, plotted these on a mapof the globe. These correlated to 12 areas on the globe where magnetic anomalies“and other energy phenomena were linked to a full spectrum of strange physicalphenomena.”449 [4372.xhtml#4248] Plotting these strange occurrences on a mapyielded 12 regions where such phenomena occurred with a greater statisticaloccurrence than usual:[5768.jpeg]Ivan Sanderson’s Map Showing the 12 “Vile Vortices”What Sanderson also noted, however, was that some of these areas also includedstrange megalithic structures. For example, on the map above, in the PacificOcean west of South America, one such triangle incorporates Easter Island, withits well-known and very strange stone carvings of gigantic stylized human heads.Another, located in the Algerian desert, also was home to megalithic structures."},{"pageContent":"2. The Russians Get into the GameSanderson’s findings spurred a veritable flurry of activity, as otherresearchers, notably the engineer and mathematician Carl Munck, quickly noticedthat virtually all ancient sites were laid out according to a schemeincorporating some sort of “Earth Grid” including the tenets of sacred geometryand ancient units of measurement such as the “megalithic yard.” No less than theSoviet Academy of Sciences became involved in this effort, when an article, “Isthe Earth a Large Crystal?” appeared in its journal Khimiya I Zhizn (Chemistryand Life), authored by a trio of very unlikely collaborators.One of them, Nikolai Goncharov, was an historian fascinated by the ancient worldand its history. Goncharov plotted on a map of the world all the “centers ofearliest human culture.”450 [4372.xhtml#4250] Goncharov then met a constructionengineer, Vyacheslav Morozov, and Vaelry Makarov, an electronics researcher.Pooling their resources, the trio, following the lead of some Soviet scientists,suggested the Earth actually began as a crystal “with angular dimension” thatonly after “millennia of motion and the actions of many forces did the crystalround itself into a ball.” Moreover, because of this, hidden beneath the surfaceof the Earth, the edges of that crystalline structure were buried and possiblystill faintly visible.451 [4372.xhtml#4252]Later, researchers Bill Becker and Bethe Hagens expanded on the Russian articlewith their own version. Hagens described her own reaction to the Russianresearch, and its implications, as follows:I found a picture of the world with a funny lattice work on it. It looked as ifsomeone had put one of Buckminster Fuller’s domes over the planet, and thedesign caught my eye. As I read the accompanying article…I learned that wasindeed what had been done. Three Russians (an engineer, a historian, and alinguist) had found that the dome-like geometric pattern could be aligned on theEarth in such a way that the struts of the dome mapped out major geologicfeatures (such as mountain ranges and river systems), and the connecting pointsfor the struts fell at the sites of important ancient civilizations.452[4372.xhtml#4254]Hagens and Becker then expanded on the Russian concept, and produced thefollowing interesting map, which indeed looks like some bizarre creation ofBuckminster Fuller:[5769.jpeg]The Original Russian “Earth Crystal”Flattening the projection, and adding Becker’s and Hagen’s research to it,yields their Earth grid map:[5770.jpeg]The Becker-Hagens Earth Grid Map of 1983Looking at this map carefully discloses some rather interesting features. Forone thing, the convergence of several lines in the southern Pacific Ocean westof Latin America is, once again, close to Easter Island and its megalithic stonestatues. Yet another line runs due north and south through England, close to thecelebrated structure of Stonehenge. Yet another node of convergences occurs inFlorida, near the well-known Coral Castle, constructed — no one knows exactlyhow — by Edward Leedskalnin. Finally, yet another node occurs at almost theexact location of the Giza plateau in Egypt. And lest one think this was thefanciful creation of New Age dabblers and cranks, let it be noted that WilliamBecker was a professor of industrial design at the University of Illinois, whileBethe Hagens was a professor of anthropology at the Governors State Universityof Illinois.453 [4372.xhtml#4256]The mention of Buckminster Fuller affords a significant clue into what might begoing on with this Earth Grid system. In a series of unusual experiments, Fullerdecided to test what sorts of wave patterns might emerge within spheres whensubjected to acoustic stress, that is, when subjected to stress of longitudinalwaves. Fuller painted the surfaces of balloons, immersed them in water, and thenpulsed the water with sound waves of varying frequencies. Fuller discovered thatas the spheres vibrated, they set up standing waves on the surfaces of theballoons such that the paint would begin to collect and form lines and grid-likepatterns on the surface.454 [4372.xhtml#4258]With this one has the conceptual link to the ideas of Kozyrev, Bohm, and others,for if matter is the result of the inference pattern of such “longitudinal wavesin the medium” (or, as some have called them, “scalar” waves”) and as such istherefore a natural resonator of them, then it stands to reason that as aresonator, such waves will be perpetually established within any planetary body,producing such a gridwork. Small wonder then that Tesla, in his scheme for thebeaming of wireless power to any part of the globe, found it necessary to “gripthe earth,” for such waves, resonating with the ever-changing dynamism of theplanets themselves, would be a virtually inexhaustible supply of energy. Andsmall wonder too, that J.P. Morgan, with his own deep connections to the oilindustry and its understanding of energy as a non-renewable closed system of ascarce resource, eventually shut Tesla down."},{"pageContent":"3.

As detailed in myprevious book The Philosophers’ Stone, “Himmler’s Rasputin,” Karl Maria Wiligut,introduced Himmler to the geomantic ideas of Günther Kirchhoff, who believedthat there was such a world grid of ancient sites laid out on power pointsdesigned to draw energy from the earth itself.455 [4372.xhtml#4260]"},{"pageContent":"B. DR. KONSTANTIN MEYL’S PALEOPHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF ANCIENT TEMPLES ASSCALAR RESONATORSIf the conception of matter itself, as a “template” or gridwork of theinterference of such longitudinal standing waves in the medium rationalizes, iscapable of rationalizing the placement of certain ancient temples on the surfaceof the Earth, what about the incorporation of sacred geometry into their verydimensions?One scientist who tackled this problem very directly is German physicist andengineer Prof. Dr.-Ing. Konstantin Meyl. Meyl is the author of probably the onlycomprehensive — and highly mathematical — textbook treatment of the productionof such scalar or longitudinal waves in the medium. The title of Meyl’s book,all 654 pages of it, is Scalar Waves: From an Extended Vortex and Field Theoryto a Technical, Biological, and Historical Use of Longitudinal Waves.456[4372.xhtml#4262] For the technically and mathematically minded, this book is athorough introduction to the theory and practice of scalar waves, if one can getthrough the sometimes shaky English translation.Meyl is a scientist who very deliberately and consciously sets out toreconstruct an underlying physics basis — what I have called “paleophysics” inmy various books on ancient history and texts — from ancient myths, texts, andtemples. And his program, as outlined in the final pages of his book, is a totalone.For example, he reproduces the following table as a summary of his particularway of “decoding” the ancient temples and mysteries:Ancient temple = short wave station Dedicated to one god = fixing of thefrequency Supreme god Zeus, = range of the short wave Father of all gods = allshort wave bands Priest, Representative of the god = amateur radio operator withlicense to transmit High priest = chief intendant Pontifex Maximus, “topmostbridge builder” = Chairman of the authority and the telegraph offices Oracle =telegraphy receiver Runes, cuneiform writing = telegraphy symbols Metre,hexameter = increase of redundancy Oracle priest = telegraphy interpreter Tripod= reception key, electroacoustical converter Looking at intestines, Rite ofsacrificing = reading off convulsions, electro-optical converter Temple books =news notes Seer, who looks into the God world = amateur radio operator, attelegraphy reception Homer = Ancient radio operator Godology = high-frequencytechnology God name = RDS, station identification Members of a family of gods =broadcasting studios of a broadcasting company •••Earth radiation = power supply Homage of a weekday = time restriction of theoperation of the station Zeus forges “thunderbolts” = electrostatic blows, whena Temple is oscillating Ritual act = technical provision for transmission andreception Cella (marrow of temple) = tuned cavity Obelisk = antenna rod12457 [4372.xhtml#4264]While this table of comparisons and decodings might at first glance seem highlyimplausible if not downright bizarre, Meyl minces no words in the explanatorytext accompanying this table:It shall be proven that already in antiquity radio engineering based on scalarwaves has been used. The proof starts with a thesis.The temples in antiquity were all short wave broadcasting stations. And energyfrom the field served as an energy source, so e.g. the earth radiation in thecase of temples of terrestrial gods. In the case of the solar god the radiationof the Sun was used, whereas for the temples, which were dedicated to theplanetary gods, the neutrino radiation arriving from the planets served as anenergy source.458 [4372.xhtml#4266]Meyl’s program, in other words, is a total one. In terms of the context of thehypothetical scenario with which we opened this book in chapter one, however, itis also an intriguing one, for given the close association of the ancientbullion brokers with the temples, they, like their modern counterparts, wouldhave need of a vast communications network, one, moreover like their moderncounterparts, that would be faster than those communications available to thecommon masses. So Meyl’s thesis, from one standpoint, fits the needs of thesituation perfectly.It is, however, when Meyl turns to a consideration of the sacred geometry inthese temples that his thesis takes on its breathtaking significance. In orderto buttress his thesis, Meyl reproduces the diagrams of the floor plans, and insome cases, side views and cutaways, of several ancient temples. We do so herein order to illustrate his thesis, and to set his remarks and commentary intotheir proper context. Meyl first reproduces the floor plan and front view of theTemple of Zeus in Olympia, showing its use of the Golden Ratio, or Phi(φ=0.61818…):[5927.jpeg]The Temple of Zeus at Olympia, with Meyl’s Calculation of its ResonantFrequency459 [4372.xhtml#4268]Note Meyl’s calculations of the resonant frequency of the Temple on the lowerleft of his diagram: 5 MHz or 5 Megahertz. On the right, notice how the variousdimensions of the Temple reflect the harmonics of the width of the Temple, withthe width being designated by L, and the various harmonics of that fundamentalbeing L/2, and φ-L, in a kind of stone chamber version of Dewey’s organ pipesfrom chapter two. This analogy is not as haphazard as it might at first be seen,but in order to appreciate why this is so, more of Meyl’s diagrams need to beexamined.The next temple Meyl reproduces is a frontal floor plan and side view of theTemple of Athena Alea, ca. 350 B.C.:[5928.jpeg]Temple of Athena Alea, 350 B.C.460 [4372.xhtml#4270]Note again that the Temple is laid out on redundant harmonic relationships of afundamental, L, representing the width of the Temple, again with the harmonicφ-L being a prominent feature of the structure. Note also Meyl’s calculations ofthe resonant wavelength of the structure being 40 meters, with a “transmitterfrequency” of 7.5 Megahertz. He reproduces a similar diagram for the Hera Templeof Selinunt, ca. 460 B.C.:[5929.jpeg]Hera Temple of Selinunt, ca. 460 B.C.461 [4372.xhtml#4272]and the Temple of Apollo at Corinth:[5930.jpeg]Apollo Temple at Corinth462 [4372.xhtml#4274]Similar harmonic relationships also held true for later Roman temples, such asthe temple of Venus and Roma at Rome, ca. 136 A.D.:[5931.jpeg]Temple of Venus and Roma, ca. 137 A.D.463 [4372.xhtml#4276]And finally, of course, there was the temple of temples, the Roman Pantheonitself:"},{"pageContent":"[5932.jpeg]The Pantheon in Rome464 [4372.xhtml#4278]Looking carefully at the floor plan of the Pantheon, however, Meyl noticedsomething that, to his engineer’s eye, looked extraordinarily familiar, and abreathtaking confirmation of his thesis that ancient temples may have beendeliberately designed as transmitters and receivers of scalar “radio” waves.Deciding to see if there were other similar floor plans, Meyl went in search ofthem, and soon found them, one in the floor plan of a temple in the palace ofthe Emperor Diocletian:[5933.jpeg]Floor Plan of the Temple in the Palace of Emperor Diocletian465[4372.xhtml#4280]and yet another example in the floor plan of the Temple of Minerva Medica inRome, built ca. 320 A.D.:[5934.jpeg]Temple of Minerva Medica in Rome, ca. 320 A.D.466 [4372.xhtml#4282]What precisely was so amazing about these floor plans of late Roman temples?It was their suspicious resemblance to a modern device — crucial in theoperation of radios and radars — called a magnetron:[5935.jpeg]A Modern Magnetron467 [4372.xhtml#4284]Meyl’s commentary accompanying these diagrams is now worth citing, for it showshow strong the case actually is that some of these ancient temples, a good manyin fact, may have been covertly designed for the precise purposes of long-rangecommunication, using some very advanced notions of physics:Let’s to some extent proceed from the knowledge of textbook physics currentlypresent in high frequency engineering and give a well trained engineer thefollowing task, which he should solve systematically and like an engineer. Heshould build a transmitter with maximum range at minimum transmitting power,thus a classic of optimization. Doing so, the material expenditure doesn’t playa role!After mature deliberation the engineer will hit upon it that only one solutionexists. He decides on a telegraphy transmitter at the long wave end of the shortwave band, at f=3 MHz, which corresponds to a wavelength of λ=100m. There lessthan 1 Watt transmitting power is enough for radio communication once around theearth….And he optimizes further. Next the engineer remembers that at high frequencies,e.g. for microwave radiators, not cables but waveguides are used, since thesemake possible a considerable better degree of effectiveness. In the case of thewaveguide the stray fields are reduced by alignment and concentration of thefields in the inside of the conductor. In the case of antennas however thefields scatter to the outside and cause considerable stray losses. He draws theconclusion that his transmitter should be built as a tuned cavity and not as anantenna!As a result the engineer puts a building without windows in the countryside withthe enormous dimensions of 50 m length (=λ/2) and 25 m (=λ/4) respectively 12.5mm (=λ/8) width. The height mhe calculates according to the Golden Proportion toincrease the scalar wave part. Those approximately are the dimensions of theCella without windows of Greek temples.For the operation of such a transmitter in antiquity apparently the noise powerof the cosmic radiation was sufficient, which arrived at the earth starting fromthe sun and the planets. By increasing the floor space also the collected fieldenergy and the transmitting power could be increased, so that also from theperspective of the power supply the temple with the largest possible wavelengthat the same time promised the largest transmitting power, so at least inantiquity.Our engineer further determines that he will switch the carrier frequency on andoff at a predetermined clock pulse. Thus he decides for radiotelegraphy. Theadvantage of this technique is a maximum of the increase of the reception range.For that the signals at the transmitter have to be coded and at the receiveragain deciphered. By means of the encryption of the contents these areaccessible only to the “insiders,” who know the code; prerequisite for theemerging of hermeticism and eventually a question of power!468 [4372.xhtml#4286]This leads Meyl to his next bit of evidence, or rather to the next stage of hisdecoding of the ancient data pointing to the existence of a genuine technologyat work: ancient texts.Meyl, having demonstrated the peculiar transmitter-receiver properties of manyancient temples, then uses the existence of this technology to decipher abaffling mystery concerning ancient texts:Direct evidence is present as well. It can be found in ancient texts. But it isquestionable if historical texts concerning ancient radio engineering have beentranslated correctly. The talk is about oracles, mystery cult and earth prophecyif the receiver is meant. The predominantly technically uneducated historiansattest (that) the Romans (possessed) a defective sense of time, because theircouriers surely could not cover the long ways across the Roman empire so fast atall, if the read in the Latin texts: “They sent by courier to the emperor inRome, and got for answer…”. The answer of the emperor namely already arrived atthe squad at the latest in the following night. The correct translation shouldread: “they cabled” or “they broadcasted to the emperor in Rome and got foranswer…”Such a big empire as the Roman Empire actually only could be reigned by means ofan efficient communication. Cicero coined the word: “We have conquered thepeoples of the earth owing to our broadcasting technology…”! The termbroadcasting technology from ignorance is translated with piety. If engineershowever rework the incorrect translations, then one will discover that numeroustexts tell of the broadcasting technology, that thus correspondingly much directevidence exists concerning the practical use of this technology.For the Roman military transmitters, which formed the backbone of theadministration of the empire, the reading off of the information fromobservations of nature like the bird flight or from felt signals of a geomanterwas too unreliable. They read off the information from the rhythm of theconvulsions of the intestines of freshly slaughtered animals. In the case of thedead animals on the altar every extrinsic influence was excluded. But theenormous need of slaughter cattle was a disadvantage. Who wanted to haveinformation first of all had to bring along an animal, which then was“sacrificed” to the god, or better say, which was abused as a receiver of aparticular transmitter. Thereby the innards served as a biosensor and as areceiver for the news.469 [4372.xhtml#4288]In other words, an extraordinarily sensitive membrane had to be found to be ableto sense and record the very subtle pulses of such transmissions and telegraphy,for they were by the nature of the case, very weak.Whatever one makes of these speculations of Meyl, he is, however, correct in hisbasic premise that the design of ancient temples is too coincidentally peculiarto the engineering requirements of transmitting weak radio signals. Nor shouldthe material used to construct such temples be overlooked, for many of them wereconstructed from limestone, granite, and other crystal-bearing rock, and theability of crystals in receiving radio signals is common knowledge.But why does he invoke the scalar component in his argument that such templeswere, in fact, tuned resonant cavities? The key lies with what seems to be themost absurd component of his reconstruction, namely, the use of the membranes ofan animal’s intestines to record the pulses, for the pulses being received arenot ordinary Hertzian “jump rope” waves, but the “yardstick” waves oflongitudinal or scalar waves:The argumentation has to be made on mathematical-physical foundation. Theprerequisite for that are the 29 chapters of before.470 [4372.xhtml#4290] Thefollowing points could be demonstrated and derived:1. The wave equation (inhomogeneous Laplace equation) describes the sum of twowave parts, where2. every antenna emits both parts.3. The transverse part, known as electromagnetic wave (Hertzian wave)4. and the longitudinal part (Tesla radiation) termed scalar wave by thediscoverer, better known as antenna noise.5. The wave equation mathematically describes the connection of both wave partsin general and the conversion of one part into the other in particular, thus6. the rolling up and unrolling of waves in field vortices (measurable asnoise).7. The transition takes place proportionally to the Golden Proportion, asresulted from the derivation (chapter 29.7-29.9).With the last point the electrotechnical problem becomes a geometrical problem,if it concerns the use of scalar waves. The geometry of the antenna is crucial.Thereby the Golden Proportion provides the necessary direction for construction.That justifies the assumption that the buildings in antiquity, which were builtaccording to the Golden Proportion, were technical facilities for scalar waves.Maybe the builders had specifications that had physical reasons and couldmathematically be proven.At this place here result completely new aspects for judging and interpretingbuildings especially from antiquity through the derivation of the GoldenProportion from the fundamental field equation. If we have understood their wayof functioning, then we will be able to learn much from that for our own futureand for the future construction of scalar wave devices.As a further prerequisite for the ancient broadcasting technology enough fieldenergy should be at disposal. We proceed from the assumption that1. the earth magnetism and the cosmic neutrino radiation are tightly bandingtogether by the processes in the earth’s core,2. the earth magnetism in antiquity verifiably was (approximately a)thousandfold stronger than today (proven by gauging of pieces of broken pot),3. as a consequence the neutrino radiation in antiquity as well must have been(a) thousandfold strong and4. the cosmic neutrino radiation has served the transmitting plants of antiquityas an energy carrier.Any thought is absurd to reject the technical function of a temple only becauseit today can’t be reproduced anymore. The artistic and aesthetical viewpoints,which are put into the foreground by art historians because of ignorance aboutthe true function, rather are secondary.471 [4372.xhtml#4292]And with those rather breathtaking statements, Meyl’s case for the ancienttemple as being a broadcast technology based on longitudinal pulses or scalarwaves is concluded.However, in view of my own speculative analysis of the Earth grid itself asbeing the result of its natural properties of being a resonator of such standinglongitudinal waves, one is inevitably led to the conclusion that both the use of“sacred geometry” in the construction of such temples, and the placement of someof these temples over precise nodal points on that gridwork was for the explicitand precise purpose of making these structures as efficient resonating cavitiesas possible. When one adds to this the fact that the resulting template orinterference pattern of such longitudinal waves, produced by all suchresonators, such as the planets, vary with time according to their positionsrelative to each other, and to the cosmic backdrop of the galaxy, one againfinds a physics reason why so many of these very same temples were oriented toastronomical points or events.To put it succinctly, it is beginning to look an awfully lot like that Very Highand Very Ancient Civilization, having blown itself apart by means of those verysame technologies, moved quickly and effectively to preserve as much of thattechnology as it could in the establishment and propagation of the ancienttemples and mystery schools, and moved equally quickly to ensure that its legacycivilizations knew and understood the necessity — if there was to be any kind ofcivilization at all — for there to be a medium of exchange based upon thecreative and productive output of the physical medium itself, and of its derivedand differentiated creatures: man. Little wonder, too, that those who sought toreconstruct that technology in order to gain mastery and hegemony over theirfellow man quickly allied themselves with those temples and mystery schools, andbegin to pervert that physics in a financial and false alchemy that created theexact opposite: “negative information” in the form of money-as-debt interest,for by means of that closed system of finance, they purposed to reconstruct thatopen system of physics for themselves, to ensure their power and hegemony.For with living organisms — as Dr. Meyl himself alluded to — and moreimportantly, mankind, one arrives at the final component and resonant cavity ofthis form of energy: human DNA, and its own remarkable embodiment of the verysame “Sacred Geometries.”"},{"pageContent":"EightTEMPLATES, GENOMES, AND BANKSTERS OR, WHY DO THEY ALL SEEM TO MARRY COUSINS ANDEND UP WITH COLOSSALLY STUPID KIDS?[5936.jpeg]“Inbreeding in European royal families has declined slightly in relation to thepast.

Inan article written for the American Historical Review, Frank begins by notinghow the problem of the ancient Roman race came to his attention. Visiting theancient tombs of Rome, Frank observes that the historian will notice a curiousand even peculiar thing:…he finds prenomen and nomen promising enough, but the cognomina all seem awry.L. Lucretius Pamphilus, A. Aemilius Alexa, M. Clodius Philostoasgas do not smackof freshman Latin. And he will not readily find in the Roman writers now extantan answer to the questions that these inscriptions invariably raise. Do thesenames imply that the Roman stock was completely changed after Cicero’s day, andwas the satirist ( Juvenal) recording a fact when he wailed that the Tiber hadcaptured the waters of the Syrian Orantes? If so, are these foreigners ordinaryimmigrants, or did Rome become a nation of ex-slaves and their offspring?473[4372.xhtml#4296]Frank’s tentative answers are even more unsettling than the original questionshe asks. Studying almost 14,000 names, Professor Frank discovered that between300 B.C. and 300 A.D., the population of Italian Rome underwent a drastic changein ethnicity, such that by the end of the period, the vast majority of theItalian Roman population had Greek surnames, and not Latin at all:For reasons which will presently appear I have accepted the Greek cognomen as atrue indication of recent foreign extraction, and since the citizens of nativestock did not as a rule unite in marriage with (freemen), a Greek cognomen in achild or one parent is sufficient of status (i.e., was foreign).474[4372.xhtml#4298]Professor Frank quickly dispatches the idea that this was simply due to a“popularity” craze of certain names:On the other hand, the question has been raised whether a man with a Greekcognomen must invariably be of foreign stock. Could it not be that Greek namesbecame so popular that, like Biblical and classical names today, they wereaccepted by the Romans of native stock? In the last days of the empire this mayhave been the case, but the inscriptions prove that the Greek cognomen was notin good repute. I have tested this matter by classifying all the instances inthe 13,900 inscriptions where the names of both father and son appear. Form thisit appears that fathers with Greek names are very prone to give Latin names totheir children, whereas the reverse is not true.475 [4372.xhtml#4300]Thus, the conclusion for Professor Frank was rather obvious:Clearly the Greek name was considered as a sign of dubious origin among theRoman plebeians, and the freedman family that rose to any social ambitions madeshort shrift of it. For these reasons, therefore, I consider that the presenceof a Greek name in the immediately family is good evidence that the subject ofthe inscription is of servile or foreign stock. The conclusion of our pros andcons must be that nearly ninety per cent of the Roman-born folk represented inthe abovementioned sepulchral inscriptions are of foreign extraction.476[4372.xhtml#4302]But this posed a rather large problem, and to see what it is and how ProfessorFrank dealt with it, we need to recall a bit of obvious history.The problem is the mere presence of a Greek surname on tomb inscriptions doesnot necessarily mean the occupant is Greek. The simple reason for this is thatafter Alexander the Great’s conquest of Mesopotamia, Persia, and Egypt, theGreek language spread far and wide, and became something of an “international”language, much as English or French is today. Thus, a Greek surname on a tombdoes not necessarily imply that all these Roman tombs had Greek occupants. Butthis raises a far larger and more significant question. If they were notnecessarily Greek, then what were they? What was the predominant ethnic stockthey represented? Frank minces no words:Who are these Romans of the new type and whence do they come? How many areimmigrants, and how many are of servile extraction? Of what race are they?477[4372.xhtml#4304]Frank’s method of dealing with this question is to take Rome’s classical authorsand satirists at their word, and from this, an important and very significantfact emerges.Noting that “most of the sociological and political data of the empire areprovided by satirists,” Frank then reasons himself to a rather astonishingconclusion:When Tacitus informs us that in Nero’s day a great many of Rome’s senators andknights were descendants of slaves and that the native stock had dwindled tosurprisingly small proportions, we are not sure whether we are not to take it asan exaggerated thrust by an indignant Roman of the old stock…. To discover somenew light upon these fundamental questions of Roman history, I have tried togather such fragmentary data as the corpus of inscriptions might afford. Theevidence is never decisive in its purport, and it is always, by the very natureof the material, partial in its scope, but at any rate it may help us tointerpret our literary sources to some extent. It has at least convinced me thatJuvenal and Tacitus were not exaggerating. It is probably that when these menwrote a very small percentage of the free plebeians on the streets of Rome couldprove inmixed Italian descent. By far the larger part, perhaps ninety percent,had Oriental blood in their veins.478 [4372.xhtml#4306]One has only to read a bit between the lines to see what Professor Frank isimplying, for Juvenal, let it be recalled, had complained of the Syrian“Orantes” river “flowing into the Tiber,” a metaphor for people of Chaldean —i.e., Babylonian — extraction having “flowed” into the bloodlines of the ancientRoman stock: “These dregs call themselves Greeks,” he complains, “but how smalla portion is from Greece; the River Orantes has long flowed into the Tiber.”479[4372.xhtml#4308]The basic historical outlines are now clear, for as Roman conquests spread intothe eastern Mediterranean and eventually conquered the old Seleucid Empire —i.e., the portion of Alexander’s empire based in Mesopotamia with its capital atBabylon — many of these peoples made their way back to the Italian peninsula asslaves, and, following the relatively lenient Roman custom of manumission ofslaves upon the death of their owner, these later became freemen and thebackbone of the Roman economy in the very lap of the Empire itself."},{"pageContent":"1. The Change in Roman Racial Stock and Imperial PolicyThis brings us to the economics and finance part of the story, the part that isfor our purposes, the most significant part:There are other questions that enter into the problem of change of race at Rome,for the solution of which it is even more difficult to obtain statistics. Forinstance, one asks, without hope of a sufficient answer, why the native stockdid not better hold its own. Yet there are at hand not a few reasons. We knowfor instance that when Italy had been devastated by Hannibal and a large part ofits population put to the sword, immense bodies of slaves were brought up in theEast to fill the void; and that during the second century B.C., when theplantation system with its slave service was coming into vogue, the natives werepushed out of the small farms and many disappeared to the province of theever-expanding empire. Thus, during the thirty years before Tiberius Gracchus,the census statistics show no increase. During the first century B.C., theimportation of captives and slaves continued, while the free-born citizens werebeing wasted in the social, Sullan, and civil wars. Augustus affirms that he hadhad a half a million citizens under arms, one-eighth of Rome’s citizens, and atthat the most vigorous part. During the early empire, twenty to thirty legions,drawn of course from the best free stock, spent their twenty years of vigor ingarrison duty while the slaves, exempt from such services, lived at home andincreased in numbers. In other words, the native stock was supported by lessthan a normal birthrate, whereas the stock of foreign extraction had not only afairly normal birthrate, but a liberal quota of manumissions to itsadvantage.480 [4372.xhtml#4310]The result of this combination of bad policy, wars, and heavy reliance onslaves, was that the original Roman race — at least on the Italian peninsula —“went under.”481 [4372.xhtml#4312]However, there were two significant things that this importation of Mesopotamianslaves accomplished. First, these slaves brought with them, of course, theirculture and religion. Secondly, they brought with them their “Babylonian”business and banking practices. Thus, even when this population were slaves, thegreat majority of the normal practical day-to-day commerce of Rome — farming,construction, instruction, and so on — was conducted by slaves. And when freed,not only did their religion and culture penetrate Roman society to a significantdegree, but this group gradually penetrated the highest reaches of the Romanimperial government itself.482 [4372.xhtml#4314] The result, in short, was thatthe Mesopotamian and Syrian merchants effectively colonized Rome’s provincesbordering the Mediterranean Sea, Roman banking was all but monopolized in theirhands as the influence of Mesopotamian mystery cults extended throughout theEmpire, and the activities of the temple continued to be associated withcommerce. In a certain limited sense, then, the Roman Empire may be viewed asbut the latest imperial front for that ancient class of “bullion brokers,” andthis change of the ethnic stock in the heart of the Empire, the Italianpeninsula itself, finally, explains why the bullion exchange policies of Romevis-à-vis the Far East appear to be the product of deliberate manipulation."},{"pageContent":"2. The Next Stage: Venice and BankingA quick glance at the subsequent history of this class will show the connectionsto modern time, for the next stage in this connective history was provided byAttila the Hun who, ravaging the Italian peninsula and even Rome itself, forcedmany of these mercantile families to flee northward to the protective lagoonsand marshes of what would later become the Middle Ages’ center of commerce andbanking in western Europe: Venice. In the very early ninth century, Venice wasformally recognized as a part of the Eastern Roman Empire, and thus began itsrise as a financial power, for it was granted special trading and tax exemptionsthroughout the Empire.But the pattern, a mercantile and banking class operating behind specialimperial privileges, remained the same. As noted in chapter four, however, theFourth Crusade eventually captured Constantinople, and with that, the Empire’smonopoly on the right to coin gold was broken, and western European monarchsbegan to coin such money. But it was Venice that had funded the mercenary armyof French knights that captured Constantinople, and it was the Venetian Doge,Enrico Dandolo, that imposed a puppet Latin government on the ancient EasternEmpire. By this point, the great Venetian oligarchical families and their familyfondi or fortunes (literally, “funds”), were in place: the Cornaro, the Dandolo,the Contarini, Morosini, Sorzi and Tron fortunes."},{"pageContent":"3. On to Amsterdam, London, the Reformation, and the Wars of ReligionResearcher Webster Tarpley, in three short paragraphs, outlines the connectionof Venetian banking and politics in subsequent European history during theReformation and Counter-Reformation, and the period up to the English “GloriousRevolution”:Why are the British liberal imperialists called the Venetian Party? Well, forone thing, they call themselves the Venetian Party. The future prime ministerBenjamin Disraeli will write in his novel Conningsby that the Whig aristocratsof 1688 wanted “to establish in England a high aristocratic republic on themodel of Venice, making the kings into doges, and with a ‘Venetianconstitution.’”During the War of the League of Cambria of 1509-17, an alliance of virtuallyevery power in Europe threatened to wipe out the Venetian oligarchy. TheVenetians knew that France or Spain could crush them like so many flies. TheVenetians responded by launching the Protestant Reformation with threeproto-stooges — Luther, Calvin, and Henry VIII. At the same time, (Cardinal)Contarini and his Jesuits made Aristotle a central component of the CatholicCounter-Reformation and the Council of Trent, and put Dante and Piccolomini onthe Index of Prohibited Books. The result was a century and a half of wars ofreligion, and a “little dark age,” culminating in the Great Crisis of theseventeenth century.Veince was a cancer consciously planning its own metastasis. From their lagoon,the Venetians chose a swamp and an island facing the North Atlantic: Holland andthe British Isles. Here the hegemonic Giovanni party would relocate their familyfortunes, their fondi, and their characteristic epistemology. France was alsocolonized, but the main bets were placed further north. First, (Cardinal)Contarini’s relative and neighbor Francesco Zorzi was sent to serve as a sexadvisor to Henry VIII, whose raging libido would be the key to Venetian hopes.Zorzi brought Rosicrucian mysticism and Freemasonry to a land that Venetianbankers had been looting for centuries….483 [4372.xhtml#4316]Reading between the lines, one notes again the familiar and shadowy pattern ofthe ancient bullion brokers’ alliance with the temple, in this case, the templeof Renaissance Catholicism and nascent Protestantism, for one and the samefinancial power is behind both, and manipulating a conflict for its own profit.More importantly, one notes another sinister and familiar pattern, that of DavidRockefeller’s “republic” of a global elite of intellectuals and bankers at theapex of a pyramid of power."},{"pageContent":"B. THE MYTH OF THE ROTHSCHILD DESCENT FROM NIMROD: A SECOND LOOKAll this provides an interesting context in which to view the allegations thatthe Rothschild dynasty secretly traces its family origins back to Nimrod, theconqueror of the Old Testament closely associated with the Tower of Babelincident.484 [4372.xhtml#4318] The careful reader will have observed throughoutthis and preceding chapters that there are at least three different types ofhistorical continuity operating:1. The alleged continuity of a bloodline or family, as is alleged for theRothschilds and their secret family descent from Nimrod, and hence, from theBabylonian “bullion brokers”;2. The continuity of methods: alliance with and operation through the temple,cultivation of science and suppression of certain scientific and technologicaladvancement, the promotion of the facsimile of money as circulatingprivately-created debt, and the policy of such families to intermarry withintheir own class and, in some cases, their own bloodlines; and,3. The continuity of class, culture, family fortunes, and even — in the obviousdescent of Venetian banking from the Oriental stock of slaves imported to Rome —of ethnic stock.Viewing this list, it is evident that so far as the Rothschild Nimrod allegationis concerned, there is a broad corroboration of the pattern as is evident frompoints 2 and 3. But is there anything more specific that would tend tocorroborate point 1, or at least, suggest that it might be true?Indeed there is.The famous register of nobility in Britain, Burkes’ Peerage, records numerousinstances of members of the European Rothschild clan marrying each other. Forexample, it records that Evelina de Rothschild, daughter of Lionel Nathan Baronde Rothschild and Charlotte de Rothschild, married Ferdinand James AnselmRothschild, who was the son of Anselm Salomon Rothschild and CharlotteRothschild.485 [4372.xhtml#4320] Salomon Albert Anselm Rothschild was son ofAnselm Salomon and Charlotte Rothschild, and married Bettina Caroline deRothschild, daughter of Mayer Alphonse de Rothschild and Leonora deRothschild.486 [4372.xhtml#4322]But interestingly enough, in the midst of this consanguineous interbreedingwarren, Alphonse Mayer Rothschild and Clarice Sebag-Montefiore had a son, bornin 1922, to whom they gave the peculiarly Jewish-Christian-“Babylonian” name ofAlbert Anselm Salomon Nimrod Rothschild.487 [4372.xhtml#4324] The child diedonly 16 years later, in 1938.Of course, one male heir in all of the proliferating Rothschild warren is hardlyconclusive, but it is suggestive that the name had some significance for theclan known only to itself. But there is something else that suggests that theallegation must be taken seriously. Among the banking clan’s vast financialnetwork, there is one financial group that raises the eyebrows, and this is the“Rothschild Nemrod Diversified Holdings” group.488 [4372.xhtml#4326] The name“Nemrod” is of course yet another phoneticization of the name “Nimrod,” sincethe biblical character’s name, in ancient Hebrew, was written without vowels assimply NMRD. It can thus be phoneticized as Nimrod, Nimrud, Nemrod, Nemrud, andso on. The use of the biblical conqueror’s name for a mutual fund investmentgroup thus connotes aggressiveness, risk-taking, and an intention to dominateand conquer (by financial means, of course).By why the evident obsession of such families — witness the Rothschild dynasty —with marrying distant relatives and members of their own clans and classes? Theanswer to that question requires a closer look at human DNA, at its ownremarkable connections to sacred geometries and the alchemical physics of themedium, and at the family tree of Nimrod himself."},{"pageContent":"C. HUMAN DNA AND THE HERMETIC CODE"},{"pageContent":"1. The I ChingAncient esoteric doctrine held that mankind was a “microcosm,” a “littleuniverse” who mirrored in his very constitution — i.e. his size, shape, makeup,and most importantly, in his unique combination of a corporeal component (abody) and a spiritual, or if one prefers, “hyper-dimensional,” component (hissoul and personhood489 [4372.xhtml#4328]) — the larger universe.490[4372.xhtml#4330] British researcher Michael Hayes, taking this doctrineseriously, decided to examine it more closely, and as a result, found abreathtaking connection between the code of sacred geometry and the fascinationwith certain numbers, and human DNA.In order to give myself a kind of visual aid, an image of the code in action, Ihad drawn up a diagram incorporating the key numbers of the biochemicalcomponents involved in the process. These were 4, 3, 64, and 22. That is, thereare four kinds of chemical bases. It takes three of them to make what is knownas a triplet codon, an amino acid template, of which there are exactlysixty-four variations. Each of these codons correspond to one or another oftwenty-two more complex components, namely, the twenty amino acids and the twocoded instructions for starting and stopping the process of synthesis. In mydiagram, the number 64, the number of triplet-codon combinations (4 x 4 x 4),was represented by a square grid, eight divisions across and eight down, like achessboard.491 [4372.xhtml#4332]Once he had done this, however, Hayes noticed a very odd and striking connectionto one of esotericism’s oldest systems of divination — the Chinese I Ching: “Irealized, in fact, that the whole diagram echoed the format of the famousChinese work known as the I Ching (Yi King), whose sixty-four basic texts areeach identified with a six-line symbol called a hexagram.”492 [4372.xhtml#4334]But how does Hayes’ table and its numbers of 4, 3, 64, and 22, resemble the IChing in particular, and the Hermetic Code of sacred geometry in general? Hayesexplains:The I Ching….was intended for use as an oracle: you pose a question, toss threecoins, and note the way they fall. A preponderance of heads gives an unbrokenline — “yang,” positive; tails a broken line, “yin,” negative….The results are written down as a solid or dashed line.Repeat the action six times and you have called up one of the hexagrams. Theaccompanying text supplies your answer.493 [4372.xhtml#4336]In other words, repeating the action six times and writing down each result — abroken or solid line — one above another will produce a picture of solid andbroken lines (of which there are only 64 possible results). The pictogram orhexagram is then looked up in a book which has a text explaining the divinatoryproperties of each hexagram.But where do the other numbers — 4, 3, and 22 — fit into this pattern?Let’s begin with the number 4, the number of fundamental chemical bases in thegenetic code (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) upon which the wholeprocess of amino-acid synthesis depends. The I Ching, I discovered, embodiesexactly the same principle. The sixty-four hexagrams are actually constructedfrom four, basic, two-line symbols known as the Hsiang. These in turn werederived from the two fundamental lines, one broken and one unbroken, knownrespectively as yin and yang.Next, the number 3. The genetic code, as was evident, obeyed the law of threeforces, which is why only triplet codons are evident in the process of creation.The three forces are inititially represented in the Book of Changes by the twooriginal yin (negative, female), yang (positive, male) and neutral, the third,invisible, or “mystical” ingredient: the tao….494 [4372.xhtml#4338]Hayes recalls his reaction to this discovery:By this time, having recognized so many similarities between the I Ching and thegenetic code, I was convinced that I was on to something of profound importance,and my emotional state reflected this: I was highly charged. No way, I thought,could the identical features of these two apparently disparate systems be theproduct of mere coincidence, for they were not only identical in structure, itseemed that they each had a common purpose, which was to facilitate the processof evolution.495 [4372.xhtml#4340]So far, so good.But what about the number 22? Was there some correspondence between the I Chingand DNA involving this number? Hayes puts the problem this way:Now these hexagrams, as I said earlier, just like the biochemical hexagrams ofthe genetic code, each consist of two trigrams, two three-line symbols, oneabove, one below. The trigrams, eight in number, were derived from the fourHsiang, by successively placing over each of them the two original broken andunbroken lines. When these same two lines are placed over the eight trigrams,the result is sixteen figures of four lines. Repeat the process once again andyou get thirty-two figures of five lines, and a final similar movement producesthe sixty-four hexagrams.Unlike the four- and five-line figures, the eight trigrams, known as the kua,are given particular prominence in the system. I mused over these for a longtime, juggling with their numbers. Eight threes. Three eights. Twenty-four. Ineeded twenty-two. Close, but not close enough. Certainly the number 8 was anintegral part of the overall symmetry, being the square root of that magical 64;but why did the sum of the trigrams not conform to the twenty-two codon signalsof the genetic code? Why twenty-four? Why eight?496 [4372.xhtml#4342]The answer came when Hayes recalled that the numbers 4, 3, 64, 8 and 22 weresignificant components to the Hermetic Code and sacred geometries of the West,and more particularly, had a direct connection to music.The number 22 was a key number of the Pythagorean system “principally because ofits musical aspect.”497 [4372.xhtml#4344] What it represented was in fact “threeoctaves of vibrations, or notes, three sets of eight — twenty-fourcomponents.”498 [4372.xhtml#4346] But where does 22 come in?The answer is very simple. If one sits at a keyboard instrument, and begins withthe note “C,” and goes upward eight notes using only the white keys, one willarrive back at “C” an octave higher, exactly eight notes later. Repeat theprocess again, and at the sixteenth note above the original, one arrives back at“C,” and again a third time, and one arrives back on the twenty-fourth note,which is once again “C.” But since two of these “C”s are but repetitions of theoriginal “C,” one might think of the three octaves as embodying the number 22,as well as 24.499 [4372.xhtml#4348]The implications of this were enormous, and Hayes was quick to perceive whatthey were:From that time onward, the summer of 1984, I spent several years exploring themazelike annals of history. I automatically assumed that, if the Chinese and theGreeks were “tuned in” to this ancient science… then it was probably that sowere some of the other traditions and civilizations…. As it turned out, theevidence was overwhelming. Everywhere I looked I saw musical symbols beamingback at me: every known major religion and esoteric tradition in recordedhistory had embraced this science…. Here in fact, was the missing common factorI had long felt existed, that magical ingredient that had given religiousmovements the power to affect the minds and hearts of billions in such aprofound and extraordinary way. They were all unerringly based on the principleof harmony, a harmony that it echoed in, literally, every single cell of ourbodies, in our DNA and in the genetic code. This is, therefore, a naturalharmony…500 [4372.xhtml#4350]In other words, the numbers of the Hermetic Code or Sacred Geometry appeared tobe a legacy of a long-lost civilization, predating all the high civilizations ofthe classical era — the Sumerian, the Egyptian, the Mesopotamian, the Chinese —and the essence of that code was not only musical, but genetic. It was, as Hayesconcluded, a “natural harmony,” and DNA itself was a natural resonator andtransducer of it."},{"pageContent":"2. The Well-Tempered CosmosBut with the idea that it represents a “natural harmony,” one also encountersyet another problem, a problem which reveals exactly how extraordinarilysophisticated the ancient Hermetic Code actually was. As I noted in my firstbook on alternative science and history, The Giza Death Star, the naturallyoccurring harmonic series is not what one encounters on a keyboard. To see whatthe problem is, we have to perform a simple experiment to demonstrate whatphysicists (and musicians!) know as the harmonic series.Let us imagine one is sitting at the keyboard of an acoustic piano. Press downthe note “C” silently with one hand, then strike the same note “C” an octave ortwo lower with the other hand. One will hear the open strings of the silentlypressed note “C” vibrating sympathetically with the silently pressed note. This“Octave” is called the first harmonic or “overtone” of the fundamental “C” (thestruck note). Now, repeat the experiment, only this time, press down the note“G” silently, but strike the note “C” an octave or two below it. Again, one willhear the note “G” vibrating sympathetically with the struck “C.” G is the secondovertone or harmonic of the fundamental “C,” and, one notes that the intervalhas decreased, “G” being what musicians know as the interval of the fifth from C(counting up five notes from C, with C as “1,” gives G as the fifth). If onekeeps repeating the experiment, with the intervals growing smaller and smaller,then the next overtone will be a fourth up from G, which is another “C.” Thenext interval is a major third, the note “E,” then the next interval is a minorthird, the note “G.” But now we encounter the problem, for the next interval,which occurs naturally, is not present on the keyboard, for it is the intervalbetween the minor third and the major second, or in other words a note lyingbetween B flat and A natural, or lying “in the cracks” on the keyboard betweenthose two notes.This interval was known to the ancients, and in fact is called the “PythagoreanComma,” for the Pythagoreans were well aware of it. Yet, as Hayes has pointedout, the analogy between ancient esoteric schools and modern science only workson a modern keyboard. So what’s going on here?Briefly — and a thorough explanation of this relationship would require a bookin its own right — what happened within Western music, precisely as a result ofthe rediscovery of the esoteric tradition during the Renaissance, was that thattradition was applied to music and to the tuning of musical instruments,particularly keyboards, so that the naturally occurring harmonic series wasdeliberately tampered with, and a slight mathematical adjustment was made to thenotes of the musical scale, so that each note was exactly an equal intervalapart, allowing all notes to function as overtones of all other notes, and thusallowing a piece of music to change keys during a piece to the most distant keyswithout having to stop and retune the whole instrument! This “tampered keyboard”ushered in the era of modern Western music, beginning with Vivaldi, Scarlatti,Rameau and J.S. Bach, who even celebrated its arrival by composing a piece ofmusic called The Well-Tempered Clavier, or to put it bluntly, “TheWell-TAMPERED-WITH Keyboard.” Rather than each note now having its own uniqueharmonic series which did not overlap with other notes, each note now couldfunction as any harmonic of any other note. This, and not Maxwell’selectromagnetic theory, was the first unification in physics, for now, ratherthan an infinite number of “notes” each with their own unique harmonic series,one had only 12 notes, each of which could function as harmonics of all theothers. The modern system of music had originated, in other words, with a slightadjustment in the system of measurement of musical intervals.This little musical detour now exhibits a profound implication, for what itreally implies is that the ancients knew of this musical system, and, moreover,knew that it held some connection to DNA itself. This is a profound indicatorthat the esoteric and Hermetic Code is a legacy of a very sophisticatedscientific, and musical, culture.Hayes is quick to appreciate the implications of these considerations in termsof modern quantum mechanics and its view of quantum reality as being anon-local, interconnected universe. Not surprisingly, the physicist whom hechooses as an example to illustrate this harmonic interconnectedness of systemsin a very deep, non-local hyper-dimensional reality, is David Bohm!In an attempt to explain the principle of nonlocality and the idea of a vast webof interconnectedness permeating the whole universe, the University of Londonphysicist David Bohm posited the existence of what he called quantum potential.He saw this as a new kind of energy field that, like gravity, pervades the wholeuniverse, but whose influence does not weaken with distance.Bohm first recognized a possible indication of this quantum potential throughhis work on plasmas, gases comprising a high density of electrons and positiveions (atoms with a positive charge). He noticed that the electrons, once theywere in plasma, began to act in concert, as if they were all part of a greater,interconnected whole. For example, if any impurities were present in the plasma,it would always realign itself and trap all foreign bodies in an exclusion zone— just as a living organism might encase poison in a boil. Bohm observed also asimilar, orchestrated mass movement of electrons in metals and superconductors,with each one acting as if it “knew” what countless billions of others wereabout to do. According to Bohm, particles act in this way through the influenceof the quantum potential, a subquantum force matrix that somehow coordinates themovement of the whole.It appears that when plasmas are rejecting impure substances and regeneratingthemselves, they look very similar to swirling masses of well-organizedprotoplasm. This curious “organic” quality led Bohm to comment that he often hadthe impression that the electron sea was, in a sense, “alive.” He possibly didnot intend this to be taken too literally, that the electron mass was living inthe same way as an amoeba, but the evident highly coordinated symmetries of theplasma convinced him that the electrons were responding to one of many“intelligent” orders implicit in the fabric of the universe.501[4372.xhtml#4352]Hayes comments on these observations and their implications, drawing attentionto the “interlocking” nature of all phenomena via the property of resonance:The whole universe is perpetually in motion and all wave/particles arecontinuously interacting and separating, which means that the nonlocal aspect ofquantum systems in a general characteristic of nature. Clearly this represents,in the physical world, a harmony of the highest possible order. It is one thingto say that the universe is a harmonious entity because it is constructedentirely upon the eightfold chromodynamic and atomic matrices, but nonlocalitysuggests that there exists a far deeper interconnecting harmony underlying allphysical phenomena, where everything is resonating at the very same subquantumfrequency, everything is “in tune” with every other thing,502 [4372.xhtml#4354]exactly as if it were one of the “notes” on a well-tempered cosmic keyboard,functioning as an overtone to all other notes in a vast and interconnectedharmonic series.And here, DNA enters the picture, for as Hayes has demonstrated, DNA wouldappear to be, in some sense, a “well-tempered” clavier for the whole system, or,exactly as the ancients understood mankind, a “microcosm.” But is there anycorrelation between modern science and this ancient esoteric doctrine?Indeed there is.In my book The Philosophers’ Stone: Alchemy and the Secret Research for ExoticMatter, I referred to a scientific paper by Freeman W. Cope entitled “Evidencefrom Activation Energies for Super-Conductive Tunneling in Biological Systems atPhysiological Temperatures,” a title guaranteed to make the eyes glaze over,unless one considers the profound implications hidden behind the dull scientificprose. But first, the dull scientific prose:In the present paper, evidence for another class of solid-state biologicalprocess is given. It is suggested that single-electron tunneling betweensuperconductive regions may rate-limit various nerve and growth processes. Thisimplies that micro-regions of superconductivity exist in cells at physiologicaltemperatures, which supports theoretical predictions of high temperature organicsuperconduction.Superconduction is the passage of electron current without generation of heatand hence with zero electrical resistance. Such behavior has been observed onlyin inorganic materials and only at temperatures below approximately 20oK,although theory predicts that superconduction might occur in organic materialsat room temperatures. The conduction of electrons across interfaces betweenadjacent superconductive layers behaves differently from current across ordinarysolid junctions. Electron-tunneling currents across interfaces betweensuperconductive layers or regions have been predicted and demonstrated to have aparticular form of temperature dependence……Little…has suggested DNA as the sort of biological molecule along whichelectrons might superconduct…503 [4372.xhtml#4356]In The Philosophers’ Stone, my focus was on the enormous implications of DNAsuperconductivity, but here, our interest is on the other aspect of thephenomenon noticed by Cope: electron tunneling.The quantum tunneling phenomenon may be briefly understood by an illustration ofwhat actually happens in quantum tunneling. Imagine one has an impermeable andimpenetrable barrier, such as the wall of a biological cell, or a thick wallbetween two rooms, or even imagine the barrier as being the medium of space-timeitself. Now, imagine a packet of waves approaching this barrier, like theinterference pattern of two radar beams being bounced off the barrier andreflected back to the radar sets that generated the packet. But according to thewave equations of quantum mechanics, at the exact moment that this packet hitsthe barrier and is reflected back to the sets, a faint “echo” of that oncomingwave packet actually emerges on the other side of the barrier at the sameinstant, and travels away from the barrier; in short, the oncoming signal“tunnels” through the barrier — in almost wormhole-like fashion — and its “echo”emerges on the other side and travels away from the barrier, 180 degreesopposite of the reflected signal traveling back to our radar sets. And, as Copenotes in the section of the article cited above, DNA acts as exactly the sort oforganic molecule that is able to accomplish this feat! It is as if an organiclife form was a complex system being held together by superconductivity andquantum tunneling, a vast biological “non-local network” of tunneling nerveimpulses. If so, then this might explain the basis of paranormal phenomena suchas remote viewing, for DNA as such would interact directly with the informationcontent within the field of the local physical medium.504 [4372.xhtml#4358]With this, then, we have the final component of that ancient technology andscience — the genetic and biological — and with it, we return once again to thebanksters, and why they seem inordinately interested in learning its secrets."},{"pageContent":"D. THE ANCIENT CONTACT: THE ROTHSCHILD NIMROD MYTH IN A WIDER CONTEXTIf DNA is such a resonator and transducer of the information content in thelocal field of the physical medium, it stands to reason that some specificgenotypes will be more efficient resonators of it than others. We are told incountless ancient texts, from the Bible to the Sumerian epics to the Hindu epicsof India to the legends of the Japanese “Yamato” peoples to the legends ofMesoamerican Indians, that at some point of time lost in the mists of“prehistory,” the “gods” came down and mingled with men, siring children ofhuman women. In many of these legends, moreover, these ancient “civilizing gods”were self-evidently white Caucasians; again, this is a common feature of suchmyths from Mesoamerica, to the South American Incans, and even ancient Japaneselegends.Whatever the truthfulness of these claims might be, we have seen that, sinceancient times, an international banking class has consistently aligned itselfwith the temple, both with a view to giving their financial activities thesanction of the probity of the temple and thereby cloaking their actions, butalso with a view to accessing the residues of that lost science and technologyand potentially reconstructing and reconstituting it. And one such component,since the times of ancient Sumer and Babylonia, is surely their Sumerian epics’insistence that at least some of humanity descends from such “divine” ancestorsand their intermarriages with humans. And given the laws of genetics, it ispossible that, with a broad enough database, the outlines of such a geneticintermingling might eventually be discovered.Such a database is, finally, within modern man’s grasp, with the Human GenomeProject. While many researchers point out the obvious and deadly potential thatsuch a project entails for the design and engineering of race-specificbio-weapons, I am bold to suggest that there might be yet another hiddenpurpose, namely, to find and isolate those genotypes within humanity that pointto a possible “extraterrestrial” connection. Again, the myth of the Rothschilddescent from Nimrod — himself a product of such intermarriages if one consultsthe Sumerian records — suggests that one such banking dynasty is aware of thisconnection.And indeed, as researchers Glen Yeadon and John Hawkins have noted, there is adeep connection between the Human Genome Project and the hidden hand of theAnglo-American international bankster class, and a deeper connection to theAmerican eugenics movement with its own white-supremacist overtones:Currently, [the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory] is a leader in the human genomeproject. While the genome project will undoubtedly provide many future medicalbenefits, it could equally provide weapons of mass destruction, such asbioweapons or even more evil genome-specific bioweapons. The Project for the NewAmerican Century [PNAC] describes genome-specific weapons as politically usefultools. PNAC serves as the blueprint for the George W. Bush administration, withmany members closely associated with PNAC.With the Bush administration’s disregard for human rights and the ban on nucleartesting, it is cause for alarm to find Cold Spring Harbor firmly controlled bythe same families involved in the American eugenics movement. Current directorsWilliam Gerry and Allen Dulles Jebsen are the grandsons of Averill Harriman andAllen Dulles, respectively. When such policies and organizations slip under thecontrol of families like the Bushes and Rockefellers they can be used asmodern-day weapons of genocide.505 [4372.xhtml#4360]While the close association of “the same old families” with the genome projectis a cause of concern, and for the same reasons Yeadon and Hawkins suggest,within the wider context of this book the close association of these familieswith the project calls forth concern for more than the reason they elicit, forit would appear that, once again, these families are trying their best, throughall the vast network of foundations, grants, corporations and other fronts attheir disposal, to learn and reconstruct as much of that ancient science, andperhaps of their own family history, as possible.With DNA, we have the last component of the physics puzzle, the other piecesbeing, as was seen, the data of recurrent economic cycles, the peculiarcorrespondence of astrological alignments with economic depressions, the idea ofa deep connection between the physics of the medium and the false alchemy of thebanksters. We have seen the persistent efforts of some nations to freethemselves from the influence of that class, and, in Nazi Germany’s case, theattempt also to crash develop the paradigms of a new — and very old — physics.We have seen the persistent association of the banksters with religion, with thetemple, and in turn, the persistent association of the ancient temple withastronomical alignments, with positioning on a global grid, and with thepeculiar incorporation of “scalar physics” into the very design and dimensionsof ancient temples.So now, it is time to assemble the pieces together, and explain what’s going on,and to offer a speculative explanation of why it’s going on…"},{"pageContent":"NineTHE BANKSTERS’ REAL BUSINESS THE PATTERN OF WAR, SCARCITY, SUPPRESSION, SLAVERYAND MONOPOLIZATION[5937.jpeg]“In the course of the next several decades, a functioning structure of globalcooperation, based on geopolitical realities, could thus emerge and graduallyassume the mantle of the world’s current “regent,” which has for the time beingassumed the burden of responsibility for world stability and peace. Geostrategicsuccess in that cause would represent a fitting legacy of America’s role as thefirst, only, and last truly global superpower.”— Zbigniew Brzezinski506 [4372.xhtml#4362]The fact that so many ancient temples heretofore surveyed show evidence not onlyof a profound association with the stars through their astrological alignments,and with the physics of the medium through their incorporation of sacredgeometries and their location on an “earth grid” over nodal points of standingwaves within local space, but also with international banking through theprominent association of moneychangers with those temples, is an indicator thatat a deep and profound level — perhaps as a legacy of the Very High Civilizationfrom which they sprang — these classical civilizations through their marriage ofbanking and astrology preserved the dim memory of a lost science that unifiedphysics, economics, and finance."},{"pageContent":"A. THE HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF SUPPRESSION"},{"pageContent":"1. Of the Financial Alchemy of Money-as-Credit of the NationMoreover, we have presented evidence that this class existed in more or lessunbroken continuity, both racially and ethnically, and, in terms of the methodsand policies it has pursued throughout history. Additionally, suggestiveallegations were presented that at least one member family of this class — theRothschilds — trace their lineage directly back to one of the Sumerian elite,Nimrod.In this, at least the methods surveyed have been consistent:1. The basic methodology of the banksters, both in ancient and in modern times,has been to substitute one notion of money for another, and thereby to usurp thepower of the state to create and issue money and substitute a private monopolyfor its creation. In the former instance, the idea of money is that of a receiptfor goods and services on the productive output of the state itself. In otherwords, money is “real” money and is a unit of information, of exchange, based onthe creative activity of a whole state. It is thus issued by the state itself,and free of any interest-bearing debt. In the latter case, money is “false”money, or what we have called a facsimile of money, issued by a private monopolyand bearing debt interest, and circulated as money. The facsimile of money, inother words, is a debt-bearing note, and debt, under such a system, can onlyincrease and never be repaid. In the first instance, it is to be noted, moneyrepresents the creation of information, i.e., units of exchange, issued inproportion to the productive output of a state, and as such, the unit ofexchange represents real information in the physical world. In this instance,the connection between finance and physics is direct and overt, and easilyperceived. It is therefore an analogue of the actual alchemical andtransmutative properties, ultimately, of the physical medium itself. In thesecond instance, however, money represents almost the exact opposite, since itrepresents not production but an interest-bearing debt, a kind of “negativeinformation” that can only and must inevitably grow at a rate exponentiallyfaster than the productive output of the state. It bears, in other words, norelation to physical reality. It is a kind of false alchemy, a financial blackhole into which the productive output of a state is inevitably sucked, and fromwhich it can never emerge, unless the very underlying idea of the facsimile ofmoney is clearly repudiated and rejected. The system of the facsimile of moneyis, in other words, deliberately designed to enhance and enrich only those whocontrol its issuance, and can never serve the broader public good because it isnot designed to do so.a. In the methods pursued to replace money by the facsimile of money, thebankster class, as we have seen, has invariably and throughout the centuriesconsistently followed a well-worn playbook, namely, the creation orcounterfeiting of the real money of a state to undermine public confidence init, or, in some cases, it has purchased the state’s money issuance and taken itout of circulation, leaving only its own debt-bearing notes to circulate as amedium of exchange.b. As we have seen from the historical examples presented in preceding pages,whenever a leader or a state has attempted to reject the principle of thefacsimile of money, the international bankster class has mobilized those statesit does control through that practice to make war against such “breakaway”states, or alternatively, the leaders of states advocating such policies ofreturn to state-issued money as credit, are curiously murdered with aconsistency that belies mere coincidence. In this respect, the followingexemplars were mentioned in previous pages1. In modern times:a. The manipulation of the collapse of the issuances of the Continental Congressduring the 1780s by a return to the “gold” or “bullion” standard, which greatlycontracted the American money supply, causing a depression, during a period whenplanetary alignments always seem to suggest economic collapse or contraction;b. The assassination of President Abraham Lincoln for issuing debt-freeGreenbacks to finance the northern effort during the American War Between theStates, and the subsequent National currency act following a similar manipulateddepression, which itself occurred during similar planetary alignments;c. The assassination of President James Garfield mere months into hispresidency, after he had suggested his willingness to return to state-createdand -issued debt-free money;d. The manipulation of the American money supply prior to and during the GreatDepression, first by vastly expanding credit, and then by vastly contracting themoney supply, again at a juncture when planetary alignments indicated economicturmoil, and, as was seen, when Commerce Department data supplied by EdwardDewey indicated an inevitable cyclic downturn.e. Some researchers, as was seen in the previous pages, implied that the waragainst Nazi Germany had a secret purpose, for the banking elite of the West,having aided Adolf Hitler’s and the Nazis’ rise to power, were quickly alarmedby Nazi Germany’s deliberate moves to restore state-issued debt-free money andby her efforts to explore alternative paradigms of physics that would lead toher energy independence and self-sufficiency;f. Finally, and as many researchers have noted, President John F. Kennedy wasmurdered a mere five months after his issuance of an executive order authorizingthe U.S. Treasury to print $4,000,000,000 worth of debt-free United StatesNotes, bypassing the privately owned and controlled Federal Reserve Bankcompletely.2. Similarly, in ancient times, the following was noted:a. the policies of Rome vis-à-vis its trading partners in the East regarding thevalue of gold and silver bullion strongly indicated manipulation at both ends ofthe trading routes, manipulation ultimately favorable to any class controllingbullion supplies;b. Similar policies of issuance of false receipts or counterfeits of governmentcurrencies were noted, with the ultimate issuance of debt-bearing bullion-backednotes of debt by a private monopoly, particularly in the case of ancientBabylonia.c. In the case of Sparta, it was also noted that it alone of all the ancientGreek city-states resisted this financial policy, a fact which led ultimately tothe Peloponnesian War and to the eventual succumbing of Sparta to these policiesand the class behind them."},{"pageContent":"2. Of the Physical Alchemy of Energy from the Medium2) Similarly, both in ancient times and in modern ones, we have noted apersistent association of the banking class with the following things:a. In ancient times, with religion, i.e., the temple. The temple, in ancienttimes, was in turn associated with the following things:1. With astronomy and astrology, i.e., with the “science” of forecasting humanevents;2. With sacred geometries, embodied both in the dimensions of the structure, andin their placements and alignments on an earth grid;3. With the issuance of money, both in the forms of real money, and itsfacsimile as interest-bearing debt;4. With slavery.b. In modern times, with not only religion, but with science and scientistsdetermined to break out of the paradigm of energy scarcity being based onnon-renewable resources, and who were seeking to develop new physics paradigms,with new energy technologies.c. And in modern times, we saw evidence of corporate and banking interest in thevast database indicating a correlation and correspondence between economiccycles, and cycles of purely physical activity, cycles that, in Dewey’sestimation, were inevitable because they were due to deeper underlying physicalreasons and not simply the result of policy or aggregate human action.But the question, highlighted in this fashion, only remains: Why are theypersistently associated with these things? Why does one find bankstersmanipulating such drastic curtailings of money supply when both cyclic data andastrological lore would indicate that such downturns were inevitable?The answer to these questions requires that we now assemble all the physicspieces of the puzzle, outlined in the preceding pages, into a single catalogue,determine their underlying principles, and then correlate these with the abovepatterns of bankster activities and policies. Only then does the disturbinganswer and picture of their motivations and possible agenda emerge."},{"pageContent":"B. THE PHYSICS, THE FINANCIAL ALCHEMY, AND THE BANKSTERS"},{"pageContent":"1. Assembling the PiecesLooking back over the assembled physics and financial data of previous chapters,the following salient features emerge:1. According to Dewey and Dakin and the Foundation for the Study of Cycles,economic activity occurs in cycles of boom and bust, and these cycles are exactanalogues to physical longitudinal waves of sound, i.e., of compression andrarefaction. As such, these cycles are in a certain sense inevitable andimpervious to human action, but the overall downward and upward trend of a cyclecan be dampened or exacerbated by human policy and activity;2. Dewey and Dakin also posit that a deeper physics may lie behind such economiccycles, a fact loosely corroborated by Nelson’s study of the variations in radiosignal propagation and planetary alignments, and by Gover’s study of Americandepressions which seem to occur near astrological alignments called grandcrosses. It was also noted that the grand cross pattern mentioned by Gover alsoclosely corresponded to the type of planetary alignments noted by Nelson in hisRCA study;3. All of this was further corroborated by the Global Scaling Theory of Dr.Harmut Müller, who noticed that physical objects themselves — including humansocial and demographic activity — clustered around certain nodal points ofstanding waves in logarithmic space. Müller went on to posit that these nodalpoints may indicate a real physics of the physical medium, i.e., that suchclustering was due to the interference of longitudinal waves in the physicalmedium itself. On this view, Müller’s theory is very close to the views ofancient alchemy which posits that the physical medium is a transmutative medium,creating information in its differentiations which in turn become the physicalobjects of creation. As was noted, Müller’s theory came to the attention of theGerman Institute for Space Energy Research, which applied his theories to notethe deep physics behind human social action and organization;4. Similar views of matter as a template or interference pattern of such waveswere expressed by quantum and plasma physicist David Bohm;5. Since in these views matter is the result of a template or interferencepattern of such waves in the medium, large masses such as planets and stars arenatural resonators of such waves. Stars in particular are resonators of suchwaves, since, as rotating balls of plasma (which in turn, according to DavidBohm, exhibit phenomena of “self-organization” and response to the “intelligent”instructions of the physical medium) they act as efficient natural resonators ofthe medium. As Richard C. Hoagland noted, it appears that the ancient societies,with their emphasis on stars as “portals” or “gates” to higher dimensions,preserved a legacy of this deep physics;6. As natural resonators of these standing waves in the medium, it was alsonoted that planets set up within themselves a gridwork or template of such waveinterference patterns on their surfaces, which, it was posited, may be thephysical basis for the evidence of an “earth grid,” and of the placement ofancient sites and temples over these nodal points. A similar claim was made byTesla for his wireless transmission of power facility on Long Island calledWardenclyffe. According to Tesla, in order for his system to work, it wasnecessary for it to “grip the earth”;7. As Dr. Konstantin Meyl also noted, many such temples themselves appear to beconstructed in their dimensions to be natural resonators of such waves. Meylposited that such temples actually functioned as a means of instantaneous radiocommunications by means of scalar waves, using the sensitive membranes ofslaughtered animals to register and measure the pulses of such waves; andfinally,8. As noted by British researcher Hayes, DNA appears to be designed along thesame lines and principles of sacred geometry and the hermetic code. As such, DNAitself would seem to be a natural resonator of such waves."},{"pageContent":"2. The Underlying PrincipleExamining each of these eight points, an obvious underlying physical principleof action is implied, which may be reduced to three components:1. All action within the physical medium of space-time itself is constituted oflongitudinal waves of compression and rarefaction within it;2. These in turn give rise to matter, which in the form of planets and moreimportantly, stars (or rotating plasma), are natural transducers of such waves;and,3. A system of such masses — i.e., a solar system — will, in its constantlychanging dynamics, both resonate to and in turn give off an ever-changingdynamic and interference pattern or template of such waves, forming, perhaps,the ultimate and now lost scientific basis of astrology. In this, since DNAwould seem to be a natural resonator of such interference patterns or templates,through long process of observation — the precise claim made for astrology inancient Sumeria — it may have been possible to predict human response, via DNA,to such patterns in the aggregate, as Dewey and Dakin suggested, and as theinflux of physicists with their analytical methods into economics and finance inthe latter half of the twentieth century implies.507 [4372.xhtml#4364]a. The Reasons for the Banksters’ Ancient Associations with the TempleWe are now, at last, in a position to see why at least in ancient times onefinds the persistent pattern of the presence of “bullion brokers” or “banksters”with the temple, for with the astrological and oracular preoccupations of thosetemples, this would give such a class immediate access to1. prediction, i.e., advance knowledge of cycles of human activity and emotionalresponses;2. communication, for if Meyl’s hypothesis should be borne out by subsequentscientific investigation and experiment, access to the temple would have giventhem access to a means of virtually instantaneous communication across a greatpart of the world’s surface;3. This in turn would have thus afforded them a means to concerted andcoordinated activity and social manipulation, a coordination we saw was stronglysuggested by the bullion policies of ancient Rome vis-à-vis the Far East; andfinally,4. If one assumes the truthfulness of the scenario of an ancient and cosmic waroutlined at the beginning of chapter one, access to the residues of this lostscience via a close association with the ancient temple would have also giventhe banksters the means, ultimately, to recover and reconstruct the technologiesof hegemony and mass destruction that are implied by that scenario, technologieswhich in turn are based on exactly the same type or paradigm of physics.It will be evident from the foregoing list that this pattern has persisted intomodern times; witness only the close association of Morgan with Tesla, andMorgan’s eventual suppression of Tesla. There are countless other such examples,of course: ITT’s suppression of Philo Farnsworth’s successful plasma fusionexperiments, the suppression of Dr. Ronald Richter’s “fusion” experiments inArgentina,508 [4372.xhtml#4366] and on and on the list could go. The samepattern holds, as well, during the “interim” period between ancient and moderntimes, for during that period, one finds the persistent interest of the royalhouses in Europe in alchemy, the ability to transmute base metals into gold. Thereasons are now evident, for the private issuance of the facsimile of money asan interest-bearing debt note took from them the most ancient prerogative ofgovernments and kings: the issuance of debt-free money on the productive outputof the state.The motivations are clear enough from the physics, for at one and the same timethe banksters were trying to recover that ancient physics, and with it, thegenuine financial alchemy of state-created money. The banksters, for their part,are also found during the interim period, and at both the modern and ancientpoles of the story, resorting to a kind of false alchemy of debt, a kind of“negative financial information,” while they are simultaneously and very quietlyfunding certain scientists who hold the promise of unlocking that ancientphysics. Witness only Isaac Newton’s preoccupations with alchemy, his membershipin the Masonically controlled and inspired Royal Society, and the closeconnection of all these parties with the Dutch bankers that quietly and quicklyassumed control of England’s money.509 [4372.xhtml#4368]"},{"pageContent":"3. The Possible AgendaThe careful reader will have noticed an immediate implication of the previousconsiderations, and that is that, as far back as ancient times, the persistentagenda of the bankster class, the international “bullion brokers,” has beencoordinated action that aimed at a global reach, with ever larger and largerempires being created, provoking ever more wars, and ever more business forthemselves. And thus we end where we began, in modern times, and the persistentand consistent evidence that this class is truly after a global hegemony. AsDavid Astle pointed out and as was reviewed in chapter five, this hegemonyquickly, and very early in its history, realized that all ancient pantheons andmyths were more or less identical, and thus that religion itself not only heldprofound clues to the reconstruction of the lost science they sought to recover,but that it could function as a powerful tool of social manipulation to assistin that agenda. Not for nothing does one find a Rockefeller dynasty supportingthe work and agenda of the World Council of Churches from its inception, or ofvarious seminaries with a “suitable” social agenda, nor a Rothschild dynastysponsoring various similar work. In this, “monotheism” really masks as a frontfor their own designs, with the claims of the three great monotheistic religions— Christianity, Judaism, and Islam — seemingly tailor-made for the manipulationand exploitation of conflict.But to what end all this machination?While many have guessed at the motivations for this vast and ancient conspiracy,no one seems to have approached anything like a final answer. I certainly cannotclaim to have done so either. But an answer does suggest itself from thepreceding pages, namely, that they are indeed trying to reconstruct a lostmythical past: a global “golden age” with a supremely sophisticated science withwhich they can dominate and subjugate the earth. But to reconstruct it, on thescale required and implied by their enterprise itself, will require thatvirtually the entire planet and its resources must be at their disposal.What they intend to do after that is beyond the scope and purpose of this essay,but an answer does suggest itself, for if, as was seen, at least one of thesebanking dynasties — the Rothschilds — are alleged to trace their lineage back toNimrod, half-human half-divine offspring of the “gods” who once descended toearth and sired children of human mothers, then perhaps they seek, ultimately,to return to the stars.But….…tracing that lineage, and that motivation, is a whole other story…For this story, however, the lesson is clear: the false alchemy of the bankstersand their issuance of the facsimile of money can only mean that money is basedon scarcity and debt, on non-renewable energy sources, and on a paradigm ofphysics and energy, and a system that must ultimately consume itself in endlessslavery and wars.It is high time to have done with them."},{"pageContent":"[5938.jpeg]BIBLIOGRAPHYNo Author. “Econophysics,” en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EconophysicsNo author. “Edward R.

P2 Masonry refers to the notorious Lodge Propaganda Due, led by MasonLicio Gelli, that was finally exposed by the Italian government in the 1980s. Bythe time the Italian authorities had shut the lodge down, it numbered over twothousand members, with deep penetration into banking, the Italian government,various Italian political parties, and the Vatican. Many who regard the death ofPope John Paul I as suspicious think that the Pope was murdered preciselybecause he discovered the extent of Masonic P2 penetration of the Vatican andwas determined to root it out and end it. (Q.v. David Yallop’s In God’s Name.)Many also suspect that the strange death of banker Roberto Calvi, hung by theneck from London’s Blackfriars’ Bridge, and in self-evidently Masonic fashion,was also tied to the P2 scandal. Also prominent in the Lodge were variousItalian and other Fascists. Not surprisingly, Licio Gelli, its founder, fled toArgentina after the lodge was exposed.26 [310.xhtml#301]Ellen Hodgson Brown, Web of Debt: The Shocking Truth about Our Money System andHow We Can Break Free (Baton Rouge, Louisiana: 2008), pp. 254-255.27 [350.xhtml#315]Hodgson, Web of Debt, p. 229.28 [350.xhtml#318]Hodgson, Web of Debt, p. 233.29 [350.xhtml#325]See, for example, the seminal work and research of Anthony Sutton, Wall Streetand the Rise of Hitler.30 [350.xhtml#328]Hodgson, Web of Debt, p. 230.31 [350.xhtml#334]S.

Q.v. p. 5.Estulin gives a further list of names on pp. 28-29. The breakup of Canada was tobe accomplished via the mechanism of a “unilateral declaration of independenceby Quebec” which would then, following the fragmentation of Canada, be absorbedpiecemeal by the U.S.A. by the year 2000 (pp. 4-5). The contempt of theBilderbergers for the perceptions of the general populace — perceptions theyhelp to create and manipulate by their media organs — cannot better beillustrated than by this goofy scheme, for one cannot imagine French-speakingQuebecois faring any better in a union with the U.S.A. than they have with theDominion of Canada, and probably would fare much worse.52 [564.xhtml#493]Estulin, op. cit., p. 33.53 [564.xhtml#506]Ibid., pp. 26-27.54 [564.xhtml#519]By “finance” I mean henceforth the institutions, particularly the centralprivate banks such as the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, etc., that havein private hands the power to create the economic medium of exchange, debtinstruments, credit instruments, and so on.55 [564.xhtml#523]Estulin, op. cit., p. 27.56 [564.xhtml#525]Ibid.57 [564.xhtml#532]Ibid., p. 86.58 [564.xhtml#552]Estulin, op. cit., p. 25.59 [564.xhtml#555]Ibid., pp. 30-31.60 [564.xhtml#561]Ibid., p. 26.61 [564.xhtml#561]Estulin, op. cit., 26.62 [564.xhtml#563]Ibid., p. 27.63 [606.xhtml#569]Cited in Estulin, op. cit., p. 23.64 [606.xhtml#573]Ibid., pp. 23-24.65 [606.xhtml#581]Estulin, op. cit., p. 93, emphasis in the original.66 [606.xhtml#595]Ibid., pp. 41-43.67 [606.xhtml#599]Estulin, op. cit., p. 24.68 [606.xhtml#599]Ibid., pp. 8-9.69 [606.xhtml#601]Ibid., p. 142.70 [606.xhtml#603]Cited in Estulin, op. cit., p. 61.71 [606.xhtml#605]Ibid., p. 20.72 [606.xhtml#605]Ibid., p. 50.73 [606.xhtml#605]Ibid., pp. 50-51.74 [606.xhtml#605]Ibid., 59.75 [644.xhtml#610]Similar groups, i.e., the Royal Institute of International Affairs, or “ChathamHouse,” The Milner Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, the TrilateralCommission, and so on.76 [644.xhtml#614]Estulin, op. cit., p.44.77 [644.xhtml#631]Estulin, op. cit., pp. 44-45.78 [644.xhtml#638]Estulin, op. cit., p. 95.79 [644.xhtml#638]Estulin mentions the case of the economic rape of Argentina by the banksters,for the simple reason that nuclear Argentina was supplying much of Mexico’s ownenergy requirements, and doing so without going through the oil spigotscontrolled by the Group and its oilmen.

Farrell, Nazi International: The Nazis’ Postwar Plan to ControlFinance, Conflict, Physics, and Space (Adventures Unlimited Press, 2008), p. 76.86 [685.xhtml#677]Abs’ easy access to West German Chancellors Konrad Adenauer, Ludwig Erhard, andKurt Georg Kiesinger (a former member of Dr. Josef Göbbels’ PropagandaMinistry!) may account for the fact that Bormann and his Nazi International weresuch hot political topics for West German politicians and prosecutors. Indeed,those prosecutors often would complain of their feeling that some hidden handwas directing the West German government, and inhibiting their efforts to bringBormann and other top Nazis to justice. Abs, given his close contact before,during, and after the war, may have indeed been the go-between between Bormannand the postwar German governments.87 [685.xhtml#680]Etsulin, op. cit., p. 20.88 [713.xhtml#694]Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile (Lyle Stuart, Inc. 1981), p. 204.89 [713.xhtml#702]Manning , Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, pp. 204-205, emphasis added.90 [713.xhtml#704]Farrell, The Nazi International (Adventures Unlimited Press, 2008), pp. 302-304.91 [745.xhtml#724]Jim Marrs, The Rise of the Fourth Reich: The Secret Societies that Threaten toTake Over America (William Morrow, 2008), pp. 215-216.92 [745.xhtml#728]See my Nazi International, pp. 64-66, 82-83, 176-177.93 [745.xhtml#736]Not to mention the blackmail potential offered by the “détente deal” itself!94 [745.xhtml#738]See my Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 99-107; SS Brotherhood of the Bell, pp.144-148, 170-171.95 [745.xhtml#738]See my SS Brotherhood of the Bell, pp. 170-171.96 [745.xhtml#738]See my SS Brotherhood of the Bell, pp. 141-308, and Secrets of the UnifiedField, pp. 238-288.97 [745.xhtml#738]See my The Nazi International, pp. 85-136; 348-350, 382.98 [745.xhtml#740]Ibid., pp. 249-274.99 [745.xhtml#740]Ibid, pp. 275-350, particularly pp. 316-317; 343.100 [745.xhtml#742]Ibid., pp. 278-298.101 [745.xhtml#742]Witkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 260,102 [745.xhtml#742]See my Secrets of the Unified Field, pp. 296-312.103 [745.xhtml#742]Yet another factor is worth considering in this respect, and that is myinterpretation of the Roswell event on the basis of the internal evidence of theMJ-12 documents as having been perhaps the crash of something Nazi. (Q.v. myReich of the Black Sun, pp. 274-330; and The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, pp.311-384.) If this be true, then the North American Faction, through the agencyof its surrogate, the U.S. government and military, had yet another clueindicating the postwar Nazi possession of this physics, and its continueddevelopment of it. As such, it had yet another impetus to seek and recover asmuch of the original Nazi documentation and personnel as it could, and, failingthat, to embark on its own programs to acquire the physics and technology foritself.104 [745.xhtml#742]For the Soviet interest, see my SS Brotherhood of the Bell, pp. 203-236, and ThePhilosophers’ Stone (Feral House, 2009), section four; for the American pursuit,see Paul A. LaViolette’s excellent study of off-the-books projects inantigravity field propulsion in the U.S.A., Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion:Tesla, UFOs, and Classified Aerospace Technology (Bear & Co., 2008), pp. 42-259.105 [752.xhtml#751]As yet another sign that this may be the case, one should also consider theallegation of authors Richard C. Hoagland and Mike Bara in their New York Timesbestseller, Dark Mission: The Secret History of NASA, wherein they presentevidence that by the time of the Apollo lunar missions, the Nazi faction hadbecome the dominant and most influential group within the Agency, competingagainst the other two factions: Magicians, and Masons, both groups with strongties to the Anglo-American establishment.106 [798.xhtml#786]Dewey and Dakin, Cycles: The Science of Prediction (Kessinger Publishing:reprint of the Henry and Holt Company book of the same title, 1947), p. 28.107 [798.xhtml#792]“Edward R.

This includes the economy, natural and social sciences, the arts andmore as more than 4,300 natural cycles have been documented with interrelatedpatterns.” Concerning its mission it states that “Our Mission is to discover,understand and explain the true nature and origin of cycles, thereby solving themystery of recurrent rhythmic phenomena, as has been true nature and origin ofcycles, thereby solving the mystery of recurrent rhythmic phenomena, as has beenobserved in both the natural and social sciences.” (Emphases added) By 2006, itclaimed more than “2,500 members in 42 countries.”(www.foundationforthestudyofcycles.org )131 [813.xhtml#808]www.cycleslibrary.org/synchronies/pg_0004.htm132 [813.xhtml#809]Ibid., emphasis added.133 [813.xhtml#810]www.cycleslibrary.org/synchronies/pg_0004.htm134 [813.xhtml#811]It is also worth pausing to mention another interesting implication of theeconomist of Mitsubishi being present as a Foundation member. Search as I didfor the presence of similar members from large international Anglo-American orEuropean banks, I could find none. This does not mean there aren’t any, but thatthey may be members whose papers and membership in the Foundation are notpublished or known. But the presence of a Mitsubishi economist is interesting inits own right, for Oriental societies are well-known to have, from their veryearliest cultural and religious origins, essentially cyclic views of history andhence of human social activity. The presence suggests, then, that they areintent upon putting empirical scientific and quantifiable data in the service ofrecovering the real scientific bases of these ancient cosmological views. Inshort, they are doing what I called paleophysics in my very first book, The GizaDeath Star. (Q.v. The Giza Death Star, chapter three. The paleophysical approachto ancient texts and myths was further developed in The Giza Death StarDestroyed, chapters one through three, and in The Cosmic War: InterplanetaryWarfare, Modern Physics, and Ancient Texts, chapters one through nine.

Whittaker and American Tom Bearden. In Heim theory, thephysical medium, or space-time itself, begins in a state of absolute entropy orequilibrium. Even in that state, however, it is quantized, with the metric ofthe system being expressed as a single unit value, or “metron.” As informationincreases in the system, the metron correspondingly is divided, or decreases.Similarly, as information increases, this is expressed as a quantized “rotationmoment” for a particular area of space. Thus, Heim’s view of space possessescertain nodes or lattice-like structures, and is thus commensurate with a viewof space-time as a lattice-like structure of longitudinal waves in the mediumitself. In a nutshell, space-time appears to “clump” around certain nodal pointsin that longitudinal wave’s logarithmic structure. Lattice defects would on thatview perhaps then emerge in real space-time as clusterings of matter or asphysical forces.196 [1123.xhtml#1108]Farrell, The Giza Death Star Destroyed, p. 120, emphasis added.197 [1123.xhtml#1118]Müller, “An Introduction to Global Scaling Theory,” Nexus, p. 52.198 [1123.xhtml#1122]Müller, “An Introduction to Global Scaling Theory,” Nexus, p. 82.

ButRichter himself, as we shall see in a moment, indicates clearly that even thisplasma research was a step or key to a much deeper and more fundamental physics.That such a plasma physics, however, might have led to such “fusion devices”would certainly have been a dividend of the project that the Nazis would havebeen only too happy to accept along the way!

This act financially ruined Tesla through the initiation offalse foreclosure proceedings.“….another added impetus for Morgan’s financial withdrawal was the amorousadvances made toward Tesla by Morgan’s daughter. The manservant previouslyloaned Tesla by Morgan was, in reality, an industrial spy who, in collusion withone of Tesla’s staff, a German engineer named Fritz Lowenstein, stole Tesla’santi-gravity secrets and assigned them to various Illuminati secret societies,both in Britain and America.” (Brian Desborough, They Cast No Shadows [WritersClub Press, 2002], p. 295.)270 [1625.xhtml#1563]This is an important point and argues against Nichelson that Tesla used hisWardenclyffe project to make a demonstration of its capabilities at Tunguska.Thus, Tesla would have had to use another facility.

Heri indeed advances and argues anovel and intriguing hypothesis, namely, that the entire topography andgeomorphology of land features and even the continents themselves are results ofsuch standing waves in the earth. And in a brilliant insight, he couples thisidea with the whole idea of the layout of certain artificial monuments andconstructions around significant naturally occurring geomorphologies. Thesebrilliant insights remain worthy of consideration, despite my following critiqueof his misunderstandings.Heri states in his book the following in reference to my weapon hypothesis forthe Great Pyramid as outlined in my Giza Death Star Trilogy:“Such a thesis as Farrell develops in his Giza Death Star trilogy is compelling,breathtaking, chilling, and scientifically convincing in its details, and yet….“The same critique that I would apply to Dunn’s electrical power plant thesis, Iwould also apply in a variant form to Farrell’s weapon thesis as well. While theGreat Pyramid, as a transmitter of longitudinal electric waves, could certainlybe deployed as a weapon, why would it have been built specifically for thepurpose of being used as a weapon? Is a ground-based longitudinal electricalwave transmitter the ideal way to configure a massively destructive scalar beamweapon — especially a scalar beam weapon designed for interplanetary war? Iwould think that a mobile position in space would be the strategically ideallocation for a scalar beam weapon…. A civilization that could build the GreatPyramid could also build a giant space platform and mount upon it a longitudinalelectric wave transmitter that could propagate massively powerful scalar beamscapable of splitting a planet apart. Such a space platform would also be capableat an instant’s notice of moving from its position in space at superluminalspeed….“So why would an advanced civilization build a weapon that was a “sitting duck”?Much more likely, a facility such as the Great Pyramid would be an object to beprotected by a space platform, not primarily a weapon. Certainly, the GreatPyramid would have been capable of propagating scalar beams in defense if it wasattacked. But a true predatory weapon would have to be able to move — and movevery quickly.”Before proceeding with the rest of Heri’s critique of my weapon hypothesis forthe Great Pyramid, these critiques must be addressed. As already noted in themain text, the best natural oscillators of these “scalar” resonances are largemasses such as planets and stars. To miss this point is to miss entirely thepoint of the physics involved. Thus, if one were to build a mobile spaceplatform for Heri’s version of such a weapon, one might accordingly have to doso on an almost planetary scale. Not that it could not be done, of course, forthe types of civilizations as he and I are positing might be capable of doingso, but the purpose of doing so is not cost-effective, for it is entirelyunnecessary for such a weapon system to be able to move in order to target aspecific object, no matter how distant. The targeting is by resonance andinterferometry. The “point-aim-and-shoot” model he is implying is not necessaryand indeed in a certain sense almost counter to the whole nature of the system.Similarly, such a system would be defensible precisely on the same basis ofexploiting the base planetary system’s geometry and local resonance. In short,it is not necessary for it to move in order to be either offensively “predatory”or “defensible” in either case.Heri’s second critique is far more telling, but suffers from its ownshortcomings:“But this strategic flaw is not the most compelling argument against Farrell’sview that the Great Pyramid was originally destined to be a weapon; rather, itis Farrell’s own repeated emphasis that the Great Pyramid is too“over-engineered” to be anything other than a weapon that draws my attention.Farrell makes the point several times in his Giza trilogy that the evidenceindicates that the Great Pyramid was able to transmit energy to “Any PossibleReceiver in local space” without requiring a complex receiving apparatus at theload end. And he presents some very good evidence and arguments that this indeedwas the case. But from this he extrapolates that such a sophisticated devicecould only be constructed for one purpose and one purpose only — to be used as aweapon of mass destruction — to decimate cities and continents — or to blow upplanets. But while such a sophisticated device certainly could be used as aweapon, there is no logical reason that it could only be used as a weapon.Indeed, the very kind of highly sophisticated and sensitive tuningcharacteristics of such a device suggest to me a more likely constructive usethan a destructive one. Sensitive, precise focusing and tuning are thecharacteristics of careful, constructive manipulation of material substance, nota sledge-hammer disintegration of it. A device that could send energy to “AnyPossible Receiver” could send much more than destructive waves — it would havethe capacity to send carefully modulated waves of energy that could communicate,nourish, build, and grow. The extreme precision evinced by the Great Pyramidstrongly suggests that it was designed to be used as a scalpel, not a sword.”While I am grateful to Heri that he has indeed perceived my arguments accuratelyand outlined them fairly to a certain extent, and has not resorted to thedismissive tactic of some in the alternative community who simply dismiss thewhole hypothesis out of wishful thinking or appeals to “mentors” and“authorities” with access to a presumed millennia-old unwritten tradition, againHeri fails to see the nature of the physics involved, for precision tuning ofthe very finest surgical precision would indeed be needed — as evidenced byTesla’s own remarks — especially if it were deployed as a weapon, precisely inorder to avoid the feedback resonance effects noted by Bearden. So this cannotbe used as an argument against the weapon hypothesis.Similarly, the reverse argument that Heri implies — that all its scalpel-likeprecision and fine-tuning evince a constructive purpose for its construction andprimary use also fails, for as the copious citations of Tesla in the main text Ihope make clear, one and the very same physics and technology can be used foreither purpose, that is to say, anyone building any such device would know as aninevitable implication of the physics employed and involved that one wasbuilding both a “power plant” and a weapon. It is impossible to disentangle thetwo, and in Tesla’s own words, in such a system it is necessary to “grip theearth.” I have merely stated the case in the Giza Death Star Trilogy for theweapon hypothesis as being the ultimate purpose of the Pyramid’s constructionsimply because so many wish or choose to ignore this implication of the physicsinvolved. But it is clearly evident in the physics. The true purposes ofbuilding such a system would, needless to say, probably be kept secret from thegeneral public at any time, just as Tesla kept the true purpose of Wardenclyffehidden from J.P. Morgan, and even after revealing it to him, only later and indesperation publicly disclosed its weaponization potential. But that potentialwas clearly present from the beginning as a logical entailment of the physics,and anyone building such a system would know that. Therefore to exclude thepossibility of an intentional construction of a weapon from the motivation orpurpose in building such systems is a logical impossibility. In short, at oneand the same time as one is building a system for all Heri’s wonderfulconstructive purposes, one is building by the nature of the case, a weapon,whether one builds it in space or not, and at the very moment that systembecomes operational for all those wonderful and constructive purposes, it alsobecomes operational as a weapon.(Quotations from Sesh Heri, The Handprint of Atlas: The Artificial Axis of theEarth and How it Shaped Human Destiny [Highland, California: Corvos Books, LostContinent Library Publishing Co., 2008] pp. 240-241.)275 [1668.xhtml#1658]J.

While Byzantine imperialconstitutional practice could and often did acknowledge “co-emperors,” orCaesars (καισηρ or “kaisers”), the term “emperor of the Romans” was exclusivelyreserved for the sovereign resident in Constantinople.

Del Mar’s mention of Egypt’s possible derivation from Indiamerits some comment of its own. This forms, as far as Del Mar is concerned, acomponent of the vast migrations of the Aryan peoples from the subcontinentwestward into the Middle East and later Europe. But the motivation that Del Margives for this migration-expansion is rather different than most: “At a veryremote date we find bodies of men — Lydians, Phrygians, Phoenicians, Greeks, andothers belonging to Aryan races — pushing out in all directions into the desertwilds of aboriginal Europe in search of gold, silver, and copper.” (p. 126). Inother words, the migration was driven by monetary considerations.295 [1780.xhtml#1738]Alexander Del Mar, A History of Money in Ancient Countries from the EarliestTimes to the Present, pp. 138-139, emphasis added.296 [1780.xhtml#1748]Diodorus Siculus, The Historical Library of Diodorus the Sicilian, trans.

Kunz also notes that the wearing of a breastplate consisting of12 ornaments is unique to the Hebrews and to Egypt: “That an Egyptian originshould be sought seems most probable. A breast ornament worn by the high priestof Memphis, as figured in an Egyptian relief, consists of twelve small balls, orcrosses, intended to represent Egyptian hieroglyphics. As it cannot bedetermined that these figures were cut from precious stones, the only definiteconnection with the Hebrew ornament is the number of figures; this suggests, butfails to prove, a common origin. The monuments show that the high priest ofMemphis wore this ornament as early as the fourth Dynasty, or, approximately4000 B.C.” (p. 282) Kunz also notes that after the Babylonian captivity a secondbreastplate was most likely made. (p. 280). It is possible that the Hebrewassociation of the 12 stones of the breastplate and of the 12 tribes to the 12zodiacal signs received an impetus from Babylonian preoccupations with astrologyand the associations of gemstones with celestial bodies and their influences.335 [1965.xhtml#1961]Kunz, The Curious Lore of Precious Stones, pp. 283-285, emphasis added.336 [1965.xhtml#1963]An important consideration in this regard is that the Emperor Justinian, whomade it his deliberate and conscious goal to restore Roman rule over Romeitself, would most likely, through his brilliant military mastermind Belisarius,have exacted from the Vandals the return of all treasure they took from theWestern Rome.337 [2002.xhtml#2000]David Astle, The Babylonian Woe,www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/the_babylonian_woe.pdf, p. 92.338 [2022.xhtml#2005]I should also stress that I do not share all of Astle’s theological or spiritualleanings, though these do not detract or interfere with the main argument of hisbook.339 [2022.xhtml#2010]David Astle, The Babylonian Woe, p. 3, emphasis added.340 [2022.xhtml#2012]Ibid.341 [2022.xhtml#2012]Ibid., emphasis added.342 [2022.xhtml#2018]Astle, The Babylonian Woe, p. 5, emphasis added.343 [2022.xhtml#2021]Ibid.344 [2032.xhtml#2027]Ibid., p. 10.345 [2048.xhtml#2042]Astle, The Babylonian Woe, p. 9.346 [2048.xhtml#2045]Consider only the fact that in the United States, since the establishment of theFederal Reserve system, there were initially several types of paper notes incirculation: the state’s silver and gold certificates and United States bills,and the private bank’s “Federal Reserve notes.” It should also be noted that itis now all but impossible to find any of the former notes in generalcirculation, since the Federal Reserve makes it a policy to pull and destroy anybills that are not the interest-bearing debt notes it does not issue privately,and since collectors, knowing this, themselves often pull such notes for theircollections or to sell to other collectors.347 [2087.xhtml#2053]Astle, The Babylonian Woe, p. 10, emphasis added.348 [2087.xhtml#2057]Ibid., p. 8.349 [2087.xhtml#2060]Ibid.350 [2087.xhtml#2062]Astle, The Babylonian Woe, p. 29.351 [2087.xhtml#2071]Astle, The Babylonian Woe, pp. 14-15.352 [2087.xhtml#2073]Again, it should be recalled that Lockyear proposed that the astronomical basesof various Egyptian temples could also be a basis of these religious conflicts.353 [2087.xhtml#2076]Citing T.B.L.

See also David Rohl, The Lost Testament (2002),pp. 73-76. Rohl clearly identifies the Mesopotamian god Ninurta with Nimrod,based on various considerations. In doing so, he clearly highlights the massivechronological problems that I alluded to in the Preface to The Cosmic War, forthe archaeological record, as Rohl notes, would not support a very ancientdating for the event, such as I implied in that book. Contrariwise, as I alsonoted, if one takes the ancient texts themselves seriously, and reads them inthe backdrop of the Exploded Planet Hypothesis, then such extreme ancientness isindicated. I believe the way out of this impasse is once again to recognize thatthe ancient texts and myths of Sumeria and other cultures may have beendeliberately contrived to function on a multitude of levels — includingchronological ones — simultaneously.485 [2977.xhtml#2969]www.thepeerage.com/p19533.htm, p. 1.486 [2977.xhtml#2969]Ibid.487 [2977.xhtml#2971]Ibid., p. 2.488 [2977.xhtml#2973]www.trustnetoffshore.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=R1F58&univ=DC.489 [3031.xhtml#2983]“Soul and personhood,” this phrasing is not redundant, but is meant to expressthe author’s opinion that “soul” and “person” are two very distinct things. Howthey came to be equated in the popular mind of many Westerners would require atome in its own right.490 [3031.xhtml#2983]For a brief survey of this doctrine in the context of other paleophysicalthemes, see my Giza Death Star Destroyed, chapter 3.491 [3031.xhtml#2985]Michael Hayes, The Hermetic Code in DNA: The Sacred Principles in the Orderingof the Universe, pp. 13, 15.492 [3031.xhtml#2988]Ibid., p. 15.493 [3031.xhtml#2996]Ibid.494 [3031.xhtml#3005]Hayes, The Hermetic Code in DNA, pp. 15-16.495 [3031.xhtml#3009]Ibid., p. 16.496 [3031.xhtml#3017]Hayes, The Hermetic Code in DNA, p. 17.497 [3031.xhtml#3022]Ibid., p. 18.498 [3031.xhtml#3022]Ibid.499 [3031.xhtml#3024]Ibid., p. 19.500 [3031.xhtml#3027]Hayes, The Hermetic Code in DNA, pp. 19-20.501 [3077.xhtml#3051]Hayes, The Hermetic Code in DNA, p. 93.502 [3077.xhtml#3055]Ibid., p. 159.503 [3077.xhtml#3068]Freeman W.

The data compiled by the Foundation for the Study of Cycles, as well asother data presented here, would seem to indicate also that at least some in theinternational finance “community” are fully aware of this hypothesis, and plantheir actions accordingly.508 [3189.xhtml#3186]See my Nazi International, chapters 8 and 9.509 [3189.xhtml#3188]For the complete story of how this was accomplished, see Alexander Del Mar’sBarbara Villiers: A History of Monetary Crimes."},{"pageContent":"Babylon’s Banksters:The Alchemy of Deep Physics, HighFinance and Ancient Religion© 2010 by Joseph P.
