To Peter Levenda, Henry Stevens, Nick Cook, IgorWitkowski, Carter Hydrick and all those others whose superb and disturbingresearch contributed so much not only to my previous works on Nazi secretweapons, but whose thinking formed the basis of much of the new material andanalysis I present here: many thanks. While the analysis is my own, each ofthese other researchers contributed many significant pieces to the puzzle.A very special word of thanks is due to Harry Cooper of “SharkhuntersInternational.” Mr. Cooper contacted me as this book was beginning to form, andoffered the considerable investigative services of Sharkhunters, aninternational group of veterans of World War Two from all sides of the war. Mr.Cooper’s unique insights, pictures, and comments are presented here in the hopesthat this organization and its historical research will come to the attention ofa wider audience. Its unique perspective and the vital detailed information itprovided can literally not be found anywhere else! The perspective of theseveterans plus Mr. Cooper’s own highly illuminating expeditions to Argentina –not to mention his kindness in allowing me to present some of his pictures here– are truly and greatly appreciated.Special thanks also to Mr. George Paxinos who kindly researched manyhard-to-obtain books for me in European libraries, including the science fictionnovels of Austrian Neo-Nazi Wilhelm Landig, works crucial for an insight intothe postwar Neo-Nazi ideology and mythos and their implications. Similarly I owea great debt of gratitude to British author and researcher Geoffrey Brooks,whose Hitler’s Terror Weapons: From V-1 to Vimana I cited in my previous bookThe SS Brotherhood of the Bell. Mr. Brooks contacted me as this book was beingresearched and written, and offered his investigative talents and observationson numerous details, which appear here. Additionally Mr. Brooks graciously tooktime out of his own busy schedule to conduct research in the Argentine nationallibrary and archives in Buenos Aires.A word of thanks also to George Ann Hughes of the Byte Show, whose commentduring an interview actually became the title of chapter two here.Thanks also to Richard C. Hoagland for much encouragement and fascinatingprivate discussion along the way while this book was being written, and ofcourse, to my friend Tracy Fisher for continued prayers and encouragement. Andas always, many thanks to the numerous readers who have contributed theircomments, donations, and interest in my research over the past years.Joseph P FarrellSpearfish, South Dakota2008"},{"pageContent":"image [images/00003.jpg] ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS [Nazi_International_split_006.html#filepos3203]PREFACE [Nazi_International_split_008.html#filepos45025] PART ONE:BACKGROUND AND THE STRATEGIC EVACUATION[Nazi_International_split_009.html#filepos56441] > 1 FICTION AND MYTHOS: THE NOVELS OF WILHELM LANDIG, AND> THE ESOTERIC CONNECTION [Nazi_International_split_010.html#filepos57112]> A.

But other than the groundbreaking work of Peter Levenda’sUnholy Alliance and his masterful trilogy Sinister Forces: A Grimoire ofAmerican Political Witchcraft, or Jim Marr’s more recent The Rise of the FourthReich, much of the other literature focuses on the survival and eventualapprehension of a few individual, high profile Nazis such as Adolf Eichmann orKlaus Barbie, or in the case of Ladislas Farago’s Aftermath: Martin Bormann andthe Fourth Reich, speculating on the implications of the probable survival ofBormann in South America. The subtitle of Farago’s book suggests that widerimplication: that Nazism itself survived as a coherent though covert ideologicalforce in the postwar world. Therein lies the problem, for the bulk of Farago’sbook does little to explore the wider implications that his own subtitlesuggested. Only a few researchers like Levenda, Marrs, Henry Stevens, IgorWitkowski, or I have suggested that the Nazi survival was more extensive,coordinated, and for a long-range purpose, but even then, however, the mainthrust of these works has been primarily limited to political and economicthemes.All that recently changed, however, when authors Richard C. Hoagland and MikeBara joined the previous roll call from an unlikely quarter and with an unlikelyperspective with their New York Times bestselling book Dark Mission: The SecretHistory of NASA, in which, as we shall see in the main section of this book,they suggest that one such possible long-range purpose was the exploitation ofAmerica’s space program for some hidden Nazi purpose. In other words, one couldnot limit the activities and agenda of the postwar Nazi International toeconomics and politics, but had to cast a wider net and include science andspace as well. And that, of course, implies that the Nazi International had acomprehensive, coordinated agenda with long range goals.Consequently, by an examination of some but by no means all of the variouspostwar activities of this Nazi International, this book aims to make thepreliminary case that this organization intended nothing less than to exercise –at the minimum – significant influence over the fields of the development ofexotic physics and technologies, over space, over economics and global finance,and over the creation, or exacerbation and exploitation, of conflict, andoptimally aimed at control over them. Accordingly, the goals of Nazism had notchanged since the war, but remained the same: world domination, this time not bytanks and dive-bombers, but by stock certificates and the infiltration of loyalpersonnel into postwar institutions.As already mentioned, even more recently, well-known author and JFKassassination researcher Jim Marrs has joined this slowly expanding list withhis own book, The Rise of the Fourth Reich, suggesting even more connectionsbetween the events of the post-9/11 world, the fall of the Third Reich, and therise of increasingly fascist policies and police-state “snitch society” culturesin the very nations that helped defeat that enemy. Marrs pointedly raises thequestion of whether or not that enemy was really defeated. As I have heard Mr.Marrs mention on numerous occasions, some of which were while he wasinterviewing this author, it was, after all, Germany and the German Armed Forcesthat surrendered, not the Nazi Party. This, as we shall shortly see, is far frombeing a merely rhetorical statement, but is one of those little noticed butnevertheless obvious facts.It is time, then, not only to assemble the disparate pieces scattered not onlythroughout other authors’ works as well as my own, but to add many new piecesand considerations, some of which were previously known and a matter of publicrecord, but not properly interpreted in the light of their scientific andpolitical implications for postwar Nazi survival and organization. Once they arethus assembled, a clear picture will emerge of a deliberate and coordinated Nazieffort to penetrate, significantly influence, and ultimately to controlsensitive scientific, economic, and policy-making agencies and bureaus of itsformer enemies and to manipulate political and economic events to its own ends.In short, the grand design, conceived and executed before the war’s end by NaziParty Reichsleiter Martin Bormann himself, was to transform National Socialisminto International Fascism, and to infiltrate, and eventually control, key areasof the very nations that had defeated the Third Reich and driven the Party backunderground.With this in mind, there are two caveats the reader must consider throughout theremainder of this work.First, this book is a departure, in some respects, from my previous books1 inthat the emphasis is not as heavily on the scientific or physics aspects as itis on the conspiratorial aspects of the story, though here again, there iscertainly a scientific aspect, as we shall see when we turn to consider theimplications of a little-known Argentine nuclear project in the environs of SanCarlos de Bariloche. This book is thus, so to speak, my first, though doubtlessnot my last, foray into the realm of “conspiracy theory,” and hence a caveatabout conspiracy theory is necessary. The old adage that Americans were taughtto believe in “accidents of history” whereas Europeans made conspiracy theoriesof history something of a “cottage industry” is simply no longer true. Gone arethe days that a Warren Commission can sell the idea of a lone nut and a magicbullet as the movers and shakers in the most signally important political eventin twentieth century American political history, notwithstanding the casuistryof Gerald Posner and other priests of the status quo in defense of the WarrenCommission religious dogma. Gone are the days that the BCCI scandal, the Savingsand Loan scandal, the Nugan Hand bank scandal, the Oklahoma City Bombing or anynumber of a host of other post-JFK scandals can be written off by smiling LloydBentsens or Clark Cliffords or Janet Renos as the disconnected affairs of one ortwo “lone nuts” and their suspiciously credulous lackeys.The reason is as simple as 9/11 itself: the federal government itself has nowentered the conspiracy theory business with its whole official “explanation” of9/11. To be sure, we were now dealing with several “lone nuts” of the fanaticalMuslim variety, but by dint of that very admission, we were, and are, dealingwith an extraordinarily complex international conspiracy, albeit a very badlyscripted one.This book is likewise about a conspiracy theory, or perhaps better put, aconspiracy hypothesis . It remains for the reader to judge if it is a badlyscripted one or not. That said, however, one thing this book is not to bemistaken for is that it is not proposing that the Nazis or their descendants are“behind it all,” but rather, that they and their contemporary descendantsconstitute but one of the major hidden players vying for power in a vast postwarglobal chess game that comprises other “internationals,” international financeand banking, the “clerical” international, the Communist international, the“occult” international, and so on. No attempt, in other words, is made here toconstruct some sort of “Grand Unified Conspiracy Theory” of modern historycorresponding to a similar sort of theory in physics. The reader is free to takethis information and to confect his own such theory if he wishes, but with theclear understanding that I am not the one doing so. I am merely proposing anextensive but nevertheless limited hypothesis to explain events that in myopinion cannot be explained as well by alternative hypotheses.And this leads us to the second caveat.Like all conspiracy theories, the hypothetical case made here is circumstantial.It remains, again, for the reader to judge if a plausible and reasonable casehas been made. It need hardly be stated here that a circumstantial case does notnecessarily mean a compelling one, nor does it necessarily mean an invalid one.It is again up to the individual reader to weigh the evidence and arguments, anddraw his own conclusions.With that in mind, however, the reader is advised to ask himself one questionupon the conclusion of reading and considering this book: Can he find aninsurance company to compile actuarial tables, or a Las Vegas bookmaker to layodds that what has been presented is not true? And will he, the reader, takethose odds?Joseph P FarrellSpearfish, South Dakota2008 1 These are as follows: The Giza Death Star: The Paleophysics of the MilitaryCompound at Giza (2000); The Giza Death Star Deployed: The Physics andEngineering of the Great Pyramid (2003); Reich of the Black Sun: Nazi SecretWeapons and the Cold War Allied Legend (2004); The Giza Death Star Destroyed:The Ancient War for Future Science (2005); The SS Brotherhood of the Bell:NASA’s Nazis, JFK, and Majic-12 (2006); The Cosmic War: Interplanetary Warfare,Modern Physics, and Ancient Texts (2007); Secrets of the Unified Field: ThePhiladelphia Experiment, the Nazi Bell, and the Discarded Theory (2008); allpublished by Adventures Unlimited Press, Kempton, Illinois; and ThePhilosophers’ Stone: The American “Gold,” The Soviet “Mercury,” and the Nazi“Serum” published by Feral House, Port Townsend, Washington."},{"pageContent":"Part One:Background and the StrategicEvacuation > “In later research I discovered, however, that the story> about the financial properties being expropriated once> and for all by the United States government, while true in> form, was not true in reality.

The Surrenders No sooner was the badly written tragedy of World War Two over when everyonebegan to re-write the screenplay. For their part, the victorious western Alliesbegan to portray the Nazis not only as nuclear bunglers who could not constructa proper reactor, much less an atom bomb, but also rightly and justly illuminedthe genocidal crimes of the Nazi regime as further proof of the insanity thathad once held all of Germany and Europe in its grip.2 For their part, theSoviets began to raise serious public - and private - reservations about thesuicides of Adolf and Eva Hitler, as we shall see in a subsequent chapter, butno one was paying them much attention, as the Soviet Union quickly replaced NaziGermany in “most favored enemy” status.And for their part, the many Nazis who found themselves confronted by theregime’s crimes after the war struggled to find justification for theircontinued adherence to “the cause,” and, like their western and Sovietcounterparts, quickly set about to re-write history. Many did so in the guise offiction, whether that of the “scholarship” of Holocaust denial,3 or the moreproperly science fiction novels of Austrian Neo-Nazi Wilhelm Landig, who willafford our “port of entry” into the study of the Nazi International.However, in order to appreciate the significance of the allegations in Landig’sscience fiction novels, it is necessary to view them in the context of theGerman and Japanese surrenders themselves.1. The Japanese Surrender Instrument At the end of the Second World War, the western Allies and the Soviet Union wereconfronted with a large problem, and the problem was how to handle Germany’ssurrender. However, in order to see what the problem was, we have to go backinto history to the end of World War One, and also to go forward to the periodof the few months in history between the German capitulation to the Japanesesurrender. In the first instance, the problem the Allies faced was similar tothat posed by the German request for an armistice and negotiated surrender atthe end of World War One. Then, as is well known, the Kaiser had abdicated,leaving the government of Germany in the hands of a provisional civiliangovernment, which began the process of surrendering to the Allies. But theGerman military, (which had no representatives at the actual signing of theVersailles treaty, and which in fact had had some of its senior generals – ErichLudendorff, for example – actually arguing for a continuation of the war) didnot surrender. The problem was, then, that the government surrendered, and themilitary did not, giving rise to the “loophole” later exploited by Nazipropaganda about the “stab in the back” by “Jewish socialists.”For the Allies at the end of World War Two, then, the last thing they wanted wasto create the opportunity for a replay of World War One, or to allow anypotential for a Nazi resurgence in Germany through a similar propaganda tactic.But a glance at the instruments of surrender only serves to highlight thisproblem rather dramatically. First, we will look at the Japanese instrument ofsurrender.image [images/00006.jpg] Actual Japanese Surrender Instrument, Page One The text of this document reads as follows:> We, acting by command of and in behalf of the Emperor of Japan, the Japanese> Government and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, hereby accept the> provisions set forth in the declaration issued by the heads of the Governments> of the United States, China and Great Britain on 26 July, 1945, at Potsdam,> and subsequently adhered to by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which> four powers are hereafter referred to as the Allied Powers.> We hereby proclaim the unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers of the> Japanese Imperial General Headquarters and of all Japanese armed forces and> all armed forces under Japanese control wherever situated.> We hereby command all Japanese forces wherever situated and the Japanese> people to cease hostilities forthwith, to preserve and save from damage all> ships, aircraft, and military and civil property and to comply with all> requirements which may be imposed by the Supreme Commander of the Allied> Powers or by agencies of the Japanese Government at his direction.> We hereby command the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters to issue at once> orders to the Commanders of all Japanese forces and all forces under Japanese> control wherever situated to surrender unconditionally themselves and all> forces under their control.> We hereby command all civil, military and naval officials to obey and enforce> all proclamations, orders and directives deemed by the Supreme Commander for> the Allied Powers to be proper to effectuate this surrender and issued by him> or under his authority and we direct all such officials to remain at their> posts and to continue to perform their non-combatant duties unless> specifically relieved by him or under his authority.> We hereby undertake for the Emperor, the Japanese Government and their> successors to carry out the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration in good> faith, and to issue whatever orders and take whatever action may be required> by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers for the purpose of giving> effect to that Declaration.> We hereby command the Japanese Imperial Government and the Japanese Imperial> General Headquarters at once to liberate all allied prisoners of war and> civilian internees now under Japanese control and to provide for their> protection, care, maintenance and immediate transportation to places as> directed.> The authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state> shall be subject to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers who will take> such steps as he deems proper to effectuate these terms of surrender.> Signed at Tokyo Bay, Japan at 0904 on the second day of September, 1945,> /s/Mamoru Shigemitsu> By Command and in behalf of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese Government > /s/Yoshijiro Umezu> By Command and in behalf of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters > Accepted at Tokyo Bay, Japan at 0908 on the second day of September, 1945, for> the United States, Republic of China, United Kingdom, and the Union of Soviet> Socialist Republics, and in the interests of the other United Nations at war> with Japan,> /s/ Douglas MacArthur> Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers.> /s/ C.W.

The German Surrender Instruments But when it comes to the German surrender, or rather, surrenders, things are notso tidy, for indeed there were two separate surrenders, the first to the Alliesat Rheims, France, on May 7, 1945, and the second, at the behest of the Sovietswho desired the presence of a more high ranking Soviet representative in theform of Marshal Georgi Zhukov, in Berlin, on May 8, 1945.The terms of the German surrender of May 7, 1945, read as follows:> 1. We the undersigned, acting by authority of the German High Command, hereby> surrender unconditionally to the Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force> and simultaneously to the Soviet High Command all forces on land, sea, and in> the air who are at this date under German control.> 2. The German High Command will at once issue orders to all German military,> naval and air authorities and to all forces under German control to cease> active operations at 2301 hours Central European time on 8 May and to remain> in the positions occupied at that time.

It wasthe German military that was surrendering to the Allied military, for allsignatories were signing as representatives for their nations’ respectivemilitaries; thus, for the Allies, the German government in a sense did not evenexist. Consequently, almost the exact opposite legal situation was created atthe end of World War Two as far as Germany was concerned than that whichobtained with the German surrender in World War One. The Allies were taking nochances that the German military would not be seen as surrendering, but in theprocess, they neglected to mention the government of the Third Reich itself and,more importantly, the Nazi Party. Granted, the fourth protocol of the surrenderexplicitly states that the military surrender can and is to be superseded bysubsequent “general surrender” terms, which implicate the Reich governmentclearly in the process.But there is a further problem.The Nazi Party, which had constructed itself as a parallel bureaucracy to theagencies of the German government, and which, indeed, under Party ReichsleitersRudolf Hess, and later Martin Bormann, had infiltrated all branches of thegovernment while remaining a separate entity, was not formally represented inthe surrender itself at all!In short, while the door is open to a technical argument whether or not theReich government did or did not surrender – depending on whether one argues thatthe Allies did or did not recognize Dönitz’s government4 – the door is not openas to whether or not the parallel bureaucracy of the National Socialist GermanWorkers’ Party surrendered, because no such Party representative was everpresent at the surrenders. To put it succinctly, the Allies had missed thegolden opportunity to insist that a representative of the Nazi Party sign aninstrument of the surrender and abolition of the Party! The German armed forcessurrendered, and Germany surrendered, but the Nazi Party did not.And this, of course, was the proverbial camel’s nose in the doorway thatpermitted postwar neo-Nazism to insist that the party and its ideals, goals,projects, and organization were alive and well, as we shall now see. Indeed, ifno legal surrender of the Party or its favored organs and instrumentalities –the SS for example – was ever effected, then this left their chains of commandformally and in practice intact. In a certain sense, the bungled surrendershelped to feed not only the mythos, but the reality, of Nazi survival and of itsinternationalization.image [images/00008.jpg] Grand Admiral (Groβadmiral) Karl Dönitz,Second Reich President of Nazi Germany5 The SS was, of course, condemned as a criminal organization during the Nurembergwar crimes tribunals along with the Nazi Party itself, and thus thiscondemnation can claim a dubious sanction in international law, but this factonly highlights the “missed opportunity” of the surrenders themselves. Why didthe Allies not insist on some high-ranking representative of the Nazi Partybeing present at the surrender, and signing a protocol stating the explicitabolition of the Party and its organizations in perpetuity and by law, thusaffording the Allies a far cleaner legal case to prosecute the Party or anyorganizations it spawned in international law? It might be argued that suchrepresentation could not come from any regional officeholder of the Party, butwould have to come from the level of the Party chancery itself, i.e., fromReichsleiter Bormann or a duly appointed representative. Presumably the Alliescould not press for such presentation because, ostensibly, Martin Bormann haddied fleeing Berlin. But there is another, extremely disturbing, possibility aswill be seen in a subsequent chapter.There is a final point to notice about the second, “Berlin” surrender, and thatis the protocol that stipulates that all of Germany’s technological equipmentpertaining to the prosecution of war was to remain intact.It is clear where the Allies’ and Soviets’ priorities laid.B. The Neo-Nazi Science Fiction Novels of Wilhelm Landig So where do Wilhelm Landig’s postwar Neo-Nazi science fiction novels fit in tothis picture?According to historian and Nazi scholar Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Landig was amember of that> significant minority of Nazi loyalists (who) found defeat intolerable after> the power and exuberance of Germany’s continental domination. In the early> 1950s, an Aryan-Nordic mythology took root in Vienna that was in marked> contrast to the flagrant Hitler worship of postwat Anglo-American Nazi cults.> Since Hitler and politics were now such painful memories, this mythology was> characterized by speculations about ancient Nordic races, Thule and Atlantis,> and Germanic religion. Also important was the rediscovery of ideas and> individuals in the Ahnenerbe, Heinrich Himmler’s SS office that researched> Aryan archaeology and anthropology from 1935 to 1945. Apocalyptic hopes for> national resurrection and salvation focused on wild speculations about the> supposed existence of German miracle weapons, including flying saucers and> secret polar bases at the end of the war… The origins of this mystique lies in> a small occult-racist circle that first gathered for discussions at the studio> of the designer Wilhelm Landig (1909-1997).6 Landig, born in Vienna in 1909, was “a staunch pan-German nationalist.”7 Joiningtwo of the many Freikorps, one of the private armies that flourished in Germanyand Austria after World War One, Landig subsequently held various governmentalposts in the Third Reich until he joined the Waffen SS and fought in theantipartisan campaigns in the Balkans from 1942-1944, for which he receiveddecorations from the Third Reich and from its puppet Ustashi regime in Croatia.8Goodrick-Clarke then notes that “in 1944 he was directed from Belgrade back toVienna for ‘special tasks’ involving new military technology.”9 While this callsforth no further comment from Goodrick-Clarke, nor do we know what Landig’s“special tasks” really comprised, we are permitted to speculate.According to British researcher Tom Agoston, who first broke the story of SSObergruppenführer Hans Kammler’s super-secret black projects “think tank” to anEnglish-speaking audience in his book Blunder! How the U.S. Gave Away Nazi SuperSecrets to Russia, Vienna was precisely one home of secret Nazi research donefor Kammler’s “think tank.” And according to authors Renato Vesco and DavidHatcher Childress, Vienna was the home to some of Nazi Germany’s highly secretlaser research.10 One may reasonably speculate, therefore, that Landig didindeed come into personal contact with and awareness of some of the projectsthat he fictionalizes in his novels.Landig was not, however, merely a novelist churning out Neo-Nazi science fictionof dubious moral and literary quality. He was also “a political activist.”According to Goodrick-Clarke:> In the mid-1950s he was the Austrian representative of the European Social> Movement (ESB), the fascist international organization founded at Rome and> Malmö (Sweden), which sought German alliance with a worldwide league of> non-aligned nations, especially the Arab states, between the two superpowers.> In 1955 Landig was in regular contact with Per Engdahl, the Swedish neo-Nazi> leader, and Karl-Heinz Priester, a former Hitler Youth leader who had> extensive contacts in the German nationalist underground. In 1958 Landig> founded his own nationalist press, Volkstum-Verlag, whose logo featured an> Ostrogothic eagle brooch dating from the reign of Theodorich the Great in the> fifth century… In 1970 Wilhelm Landig became the Austrian representative of> the World Anti-Communist League (WACL), founded in Taiwan in 1967 after a> merger of the Asian people’s Anti-Communist League and the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc> of Nations. This was arguably the most important far-right network in the> world and accounts for Landig’s highly informed international news service.11 As will be seen in subsequent chapters, there is more afoot with Neo-Nazimachinations in Arab states, and in the creation of a third bloc of nations tooffset the two superpowers, than meets the eye. And as will also be seen, theWorld Anti-Communist League has more than its own fair share of connections topostwar Nazis and Fascists.But in addition to all this activism, Landig had one other activity, for afterhis arrest and internment in a British POW camp from 1945-1947 as a former SSmember, Landig upon his release “entered the world of inter-Allied espionage,hawking low - and medium-grade Soviet intelligence to Western securityservices.”12 In other words, Landig was, in some capacity, part of the vastnetwork of Nazi spies operating in Europe, and he functioned most likely as alow level member of General Reinhard Gehlen’s “Gehlenorg,” headquartered inPullach, just outside of Munich. General Gehlen was, of course, the Germangeneral who was the head of all German military intelligence during the Nazi erafor eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, the Fremde Heere Ost or “Foreign ArmiesEast”, and he was also, of course, the General who secretly negotiated withAmerican OSS station chief in Zurich, Switzerland, Allen Dulles, to turn over tothe Americans his entire network so long as the network remained in theday-today operational control of Gehlen himself! As I have noted in my previousbook The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, this meant that before President Truman’ssignature was even dry on the National Security Act of 1947 which created theCIA, its civilian character and charter had already been severely compromised,since almost its entire operational and analytical “Soviet desk” was staffed bya bunch of “former” Nazis!13image [images/00009.jpg] General Reinhard Gehlen During the War image [images/00010.jpg] OSS Station Zurich Station Chief, Subsequent CIA Director, andWarren Commission Member Allen Dulles 1. Landig’s First Novel: Götzen gegen Thule It is in Landig’s “Thule” trilogy of novels that the myths of Nazi survival findtheir firmest and clearest postwar expression.> The first of these, Götzen gegen Thule (1971), was begun in the late> 1950s…Theories of Aryan polar origins and Atlantis are mixed with powerful new> nationalist myths of ‘the last battalion,’ secret German UFO bases in the> Arctic, alchemy, Grail myths and Cathar heresies, and a Nazi-Tibetan> connection involving Himalayan masters and an underground kingdom in> Mongolia.14 However, it is what Goodrick-Clark does not mention – the novel’s subtitle -that is most significant, for Landig’s subtitle says that it is Ein Roman vollerWirklichkeiten, a “novel full of realities.”And this may not be far from the truth, for as I point out in my book ThePhilosophers’ Stone, the alchemical influence within Himmler’s SS waspervasive.15 Additionally, that influence included a fascination with theGrail,16 with the Cathars and the Languedoc region of southwestern France thatthey inhabited,17 and as is also well known, Himmler personally sponsored the SSexpedition to Tibet in 1938-1939.18Indeed, there is much more to Landig’s thousand page monster novel than justthis, and Goodrick-Clarke’s summary is as good as any:> Götzen gegen Thule is an allegory of the Landig circle’s attempts to make> contact with an esoteric center of Nordic traditions, the legendary realm of> Thule, the final bastion of the Germanic world in defeat. The story describes> the world odyssey of a small group of SS soldiers and Luftwaffe airmen across> four continents in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War. In the> first part of the novel the two airmen, Recke (“berseker”) and Reimer> (“bard”), are sent from Norway to Point 103, a secret base that has been> established by the esoteric SS elite in Arctic Canada, unknown to the Allies> and also to most German authorities. Point 103 is a large underground complex> equipped with highly advanced technology, including flying saucers whose> apparent mission is to maintain the spirit of German defense after the final> surrender of the Reich… Its symbol is the alchemical Black Sun, a round disk> that is not exactly black but the deepest violet.> Like Landig’s bloc of unaligned nations against the superpowers, Point 103> seeks to promote an international alliance for the ideals of the Black Sun.> Many foreign delegates attend a great conference held in the assembly hall of> the base decorated with astrological symbols and an enormous icon of Mithras> slaying the Bull. The delegates have all been flown to the conference by means> of the V-7, a German flying saucer with a speed of 4,000 kilometers per hour> and a range of 2,000 kilometers. These include a Tibetan lama, Japanese,> Chinese, and American officers, Indians, Arabs, Persians, an Ethiopian, a> Brazilian officer, a Venezuelan, a Siamese and a full-blooded Mexican Indian.> The Arabs speak darkly of secret Islamic brotherhoods, the Indians and> Persians invoke old Aryan traditions, the Orientals allude to their occult> orders and a mysterious world center. Attired in their uniforms or national> dress, many of the delegates make speeches identifying their national myths> and ideals with those of the Thule and pledge their full support when the time> comes for action.19 Peeling back the fantastic layers, however, reveals an interesting picture.Boiling Landig’s plot down to its basic essentials, one has the followingintriguing list:> 1) A secret base in the Canadian Arctic, i.e., a secret base in a polar or> cold region that is remote and unknown to the Allies;> 2) This base is staffed by former SS and Luftwaffe officers and men;> 3) The point of departure to this secret enclave was Norway;> 4) The secret base employs (and presumably develops) advanced technology,> which includes flying saucers, i.e., advanced aerodynes employing advanced> propulsion;> 5) This base is intimately involved with the creation of a bloc of nations to> offset the geopolitical preponderance of the Soviet Union and the United> States;> 6) This bloc of nations in turn represents the internationalization of the> Nazi ideology, and extends to Latin America, the Orient, and various American> Indians, that is, there is an international covert Nazi organization, and that> Nazism has internationalized itself into a multi-ethnic Fascist organization> with a German core;> 7) This bloc also consists to some extent of “secret Islamic brotherhoods” and> Oriental “occult orders” and a “world center” in presumably covert conflict> with the two superpowers and their aligned blocs of nations. 2. Landig’s Second Novel: WolfzeitIn Landig’s second novel, Wolfszeit um Thule (1980), a similar odyssey isdescribed:> Here the narrative follows the adventures of two naval officers, Krall and> Hellfeldt, and SS-Major Eyken, formerly stationed at Point 103. Assigned to a> flotilla of German U-boats which leaves Norway in early May 1945, they achieve> a devastating victory over an Allied naval convoy in the North Atlantic. The> flotilla collects all equipment and personnel from Point 103, which is then> evacuated and totally destroyed… The flotilla sets sail for the South Atlantic> to make contact with the new bases of the Black Sun, the epithet of the shadow> Reich government in exile. The geographical focus of this novel thus indicates> the shift of Nazi survival toward Latin America and Antarctica, the new Thule> of the Southern Hemisphere.20 Before proceeding with Goodrick-Clarke’s summary of this second novel, note whatwe have once again:> 1) The expedition departs by U-boat from Norway once again;> 2) Its ultimate goal is to evacuate advanced technology (from Point 103 in> Canada) to Latin America, where:> 3) The Reich government is in exile. Once in South America, things take another very intriguing turn, for the novel’sheroes “find support in Buenos Aires”21 and continue their travels onward to LaPaz, Bolivia.Once there, the hero Eyken lectures the others on the work of the real-lifepersonage, Edmund Kiss. And as Goodrick-Clarke notes, Kiss’s research> In Bolivia links up with new developments. Along the western side of the Andes> mountains he discovered an extensive tunnel system stretching from the Atacama> Desert as far as Ecuador, attributing it to a mysterious people with> unimaginable technology many thousands of years ago. And here, much to their Teutonic delight, Eyken and companions marvel at the“several hundred German military and scientific personnel” who “have establisheda secret base called Mime’s Smithy as a companion to point 211 in Antarctica.”22As Goodrick-Clarke also notes, Mime is the figure of Norse mythology who forgesSiegfried’s sword, as popularized in composer Richard Wagner’s opera DasRheingold.In any case,> Eyken and his comrades spend many months at this site, marveling at the> advanced technology brought by German scientists who have escaped the American> and Soviet dragnets for Third Reich miracle weapons researchers. Another,> smaller secret base in the Andes has been established in the Brazilian forest> near the Beni Valley.23 Once again, we have the following elements:> 1) a secret base or bases employing advanced technology;> 2) in the remote environs of the Andes mountains, with> 3) “hundreds” of German scientists and technicians who are> 4) continuing to work on their advanced secret weapons projects, independently> of Allied oversight and perhaps of Allied knowledge. The clear implication of Landig’s second novel is that in spite of Russian andAmerican attempts to corner the market on Nazi technology, the best and mostadvanced of that technology eluded them, remained under more or less independentNazi control, and continued to be developed by them . And note one more thing:while in Buenos Aires Eyken and his companions receive “support.” This, as weshall learn in Part Three, is not only true, but true in a way that corroboratesall four of the main points of Landig’s second novel! Clearly Landig hasdeveloped the implication of the two German surrenders, for in his first twonovels, it is quite apparent that it is the Nazi party and its most-favoredorganization, the SS, that has survived and is overseeing these bases andtechnology.3. Landig’s Third Novel: Rebellen für Thule In his third novel, Rebellen für Thule (1991) Landig pulls the curtain back onthe historical-esoteric connections underpinning all this independent and covertNazi survival, and its continued development of exotic technology, for in it hetraces the origin of the Black Sun concept back to ancient Babylonianreligion.24This connection between the SS Schwarze Sonne (Black Sun) and Babylon was notmerely wishful thinking on Landig’s part, for it formed part of mainstreamGerman scholarship and Sumerology from the mid-nineteenth century, and thefamous German Assyriologist Friedrich Delitzsch. 25 Delitsch argued> That the Old Testament and Jewish monotheism were derived from Babylonian> religion. His initial lecture, “Babel und Bibel” (1902),26 aroused widespread> controversy, as it clearly weakened Jewish claims of divine revelation and> election. Taking the debate a stage further, Houston Stewart Chamberlain and> Herman Wirth regarded Babylonian culture as a heritage of the Sumerians, whom> they identified as early Aryan colonizers of Mesopotamia. Landig’s> interpretation of the Gilgamesh epic and inscriptions from Babylon follow this> Nordic-Sumerian line by highlighting their correspondences to the Edda and old> Norse sources.27 The clear implication of Landig’s assertions, following as it does the broadtraditions of German Assyriological scholarship of the late nineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries, is that one of the main preoccupations of the SS wasprecisely the covert continuance of this tradition. Viewed in the wider contextof his other novels, the implication is that there might be a connection betweenthis esoteric preoccupation and the physics behind their continued blackprojects at their postwar bases.28C. Unusual “Corroboration”: The Nazi UFO Myths and BaronRudolf Von Sebottendorff The esoteric connection between Nazism, high technology, and advanced aircraftwas a part of the emerging “mythos” of Nazism within Neo-Nazi circles in the1950s, the kernel of which was that “the flying disks were an important part ofa German plan to create an extraterritorial state prior to a renewed attack onthe Allied enemies after 1945…Nazi ufologists would recycle…and match Adamski’sphotographs with new ‘discoveries’ of wartime SS designs.”29 As Goodrick-Clarkenotes, this mythos may reflect as much a moral palliative as an actual agenda,for “the fearful nature of the Third Reich and the burden of its defeat are thusdeflected in a science fiction vision of German technical and racial superiorityas the huge saucers rise about the brilliant white snows of an iceboundShanrgi-La”30 that was located in Antarctica.But there is a slight problem with Goodrick-Clarke’s easy dismissal of theorigins of the Nazi UFO mythos, for at approximately the same time as famous –or depending upon one’s lights, infamous – UFO contactee George Adamski waspublishing photos and films of his saucers and writing of his contact withblond-haired blue-eyed Nordic UFO occupants(!), a former Luftwaffe major, RudolfLusar, published an astonishing book about German secret weapons, a briefsection of which mentioned Nazi experimentation with jet-turbine flying saucers.Notably, the diagrams in Lusar’s book look nothing like the later alleged“discoveries” of flying saucer schematics allegedly drawn up under auspices ofthe SS.31 The timing of Lusar’s book and the Adamski sightings, while permittingthe possibility of some small degree of influence between the two, makes itnevertheless unlikely, for Lusar’s “saucers”, jet-propelled and clumsy-lookingaffairs that they are, hardly serve to corroborate the emerging Nazi UFO mythos.There is also a deeper problem with Goodrick-Clarke’s dismissal of the originsof the Nazi UFO mythos, and that is evident from an examination of the actualimplications of his own remarks. As noted above, he believes that these flyingsaucers were, according to the mythos itself “an important part of a German planto create an extraterritorial state prior to a renewed attack on the Alliedenemies after 1945…”32 If one leaves the question of flying saucers out of view,and focuses on what they represent, then the Nazi mythos, according toGoodrick-Clarke, is making the following assertions:> 1) There was a plan to create a postwar “extraterritorial” Nazi state,> strongly suggestive in itself of a surviving postwar Nazi International> organization; and,> 2) Part of the original planning for that “extraterritorial” Nazi state> included the continued development of the most advanced technology in the> possession of the Third Reich by the end of the war. Viewed in this way, the Nazi “flying saucer” myth is much more sobering in itsimplications.However, there is a further esoteric connection to Sumer, Babylon, and ancientPersia, for some researching in the postwar Neo-Nazi circles made the claim thatThule Society founder Baron Rudolf Von Sebottendorff> Discovered old texts or oral traditions on his travels in the Middle East> relating to (a) dualist rejection of El Shaddai (Jahve), the god of the Old> Testament, whom Jesus identified as the devil (John 8:44).33 Sebottendorff> also allegedly found Persian and Babylonian references to a millennial battle> between good and evil, which inspired his (spurious) book Der interkosmische> Weltenkampf (1919). Sebottendorff was supposed to be acquainted with the> prophecy of the “Third Sargon” by the Babylonian seeress Sajaha (c. 650 B.C.),> which told of terrible woes and the inversion of all values until the avenging> emperor would arrive from the north…and destroy all evil by fire. As if that were not all, the same researchers – Jürgen-Ratthofer and Ralf Ettl –maintained that in August of 1917, the Baron and Hitler’s future geopoliticsguru, General Karl Haushofer, the medium Maria Orsic, and a pilot named LotharWeiz met> The old prelate Gernot of the Societas Templi Marconi at a café in Vienna.> Their discussions turned on astrology and apocalyptic predictions in Indian,> German, and Babylonian traditions. Gernot was highly impressed and invited> Sebottendorff to visit the secret estate of his Templar order known as the> “Die Herren vom Schwarzen Stein” (DHvSS) (Lords of the Black Stone) at> Marktschellenberg in Bavaria. The DHvSS was supposedly founded by the Knight> Commander Hubertus Koch in 1221 as a Marcionite34 Templar order. Its dualist> and Gnostic “Babylonian” doctrine told of the dominion of evil on earth and> the battle between light and El Shaddai based on the revelations of the> goddess Ishtar. The Black Sun is the divine source of energy accessible to> initiates through a hierarchy of spiritual intermediaries. Through the DHvSS,> Sebottendorff understood that Marcionite anti-Judaist teachings ultimately> came from the much older Babylonian doctrine common to all Aryan peoples. The> cosmic challenge of the age demanded the defeat of El Shaddai and the Jews.35 It was in fact Jürgen-Ratthofer and Ettl who first popularized the references tothe mysterious “Vril” force in Neo-Nazi circles.The “Vril” force, according to the new esoteric mythos, was the area of covertinvestigation of the so-called “Vril Society,” a society that was, in fact,first mentioned by the famous German rocket engineer Willy Ley,36 who had fledto the United States to escape the Nazi regime. Ley maintained that such asociety existed in Berlin, which raises the significant question: why would arocket scientist know of a secret society in Berlin that was supposedlyinvestigating the “Vril” force, the power of the aether, itself?One answer is that> German researchers have recently established that such a group did exist in> association with the astrological publisher Wilhelm Becker. This wholly> obscure “Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft ‘Das Kommende Deutschland’” published a> short brochure Vril: Die kosmische Urkraft (1930), which described the> Atlanteans as possessors of a spiritual “dynamo-technology,” superior to the> mechanistic notions of modern science. Based on Vril energy, this technology> also enabled the Egyptians and Aztecs to build their pyramids… The group’s> second brochure, Weltdynamismus (1930), rejected explosive technology and> spoke of the release of free energy.37 In other words, perhaps Ley had come upon the brochures in Germany and readthem.In any case, Jürgen-Ratthofer and Ettl elaborate their account even further,maintaining that the Vril Society was the esoteric offshoot of VonSebottendorff’s Germanenorden (German Order), with its political branch becomingSebottendorff’s Thule Society after World War One.38 In their version, which wasrepeated in the much more widely circulated account of Jan Van Helsing,39 asecret meeting of Thule and Vril members was held in December of 1919 nearBerchtesgaden. Here, the medium Maria Orsic> Presented transcripts in an old Templar script of communications she had> received telepathically. These proved to be written in Sumerian, the language> of the founders of the oldest Babylonian culture. These channeled> communications came from the planet Sumi-Er in the solar system of Aldebaran,> the brightest star in the constellation of Taurus… Jürgen-Ratthofer and Ettl> claim that the DHvSS and its modern successor, the Vril Society, received> mediumistic confirmation that the Sumerians were a colony of superior beings> sent from Aldebaran to earth 500 million years ago.40 According to Jürgen-Ratthofer and Ettl, that is not all that Maria Orsicchanneled, for she> Next received channeled instructions for the construction of a time-travel> machine. A leading member of the Vril, Dr. W.O. Schumann, pioneered the> development of electromagnetic fields through rotating disks, and a prototype> was constructed near Munich in 1922…> In June 1934 Lothar Weiz flew the first RFZ 1 (Rundflugzeug) at> Brandenburg. The stimulus of military innovation quickly led to highly> advanced craft. Thereafter, the Thule Society took a hand by establishing the> SS Development Department E-IV for advanced saucer technology.41 It would be easy to dismiss all these Neo-Nazi fantasies as the ravings of utterlunatics, were it not for a few uncomfortable facts.Once again, if one removes all the fantastical elements and generalizes theconcepts implicated in these assertions, one has the following assertions:> 1) There was an advanced project, beginning some time in the 1920s in Germany,> to control time and gravity. The date given is 1922, which is the same> approximate time as the publication of the first real hyper-dimensional> unified field theory attempt to unify gravity and electromagnetism, the theory> of German mathematician Theodor Kaluza;42> 2) This project was based on, or inspired and influenced in part by, reference> to some sort of esoteric tradition, and its interpretation or “decoding” in> terms of modern physics, as indicated by the presence of Dr. W.O. Schumann as> an alleged member in the secret society attempting to construct this machine;> 3) The principle in use in this machine was apparently rotating> electromagnetic fields in disks, implying that more than one rotating> electromagnetic field was in play; and,> 4) This project later became a department of the SS, called the Development> Area IV. When viewed in this way, Jürgen-Ratthofer and Ettl’s assertions seem not sofar-fetched, for as I detail in my previous books, there is a possibility thatthe Bell project itself may represent a a super-secret project begun, in fact,during the 1920s in Weimar Germany.43 Moreover, there is a circumstantial caseto be made that this project was influenced, in part, by the decoding of ancientesotericism in terms of modern physics.44 And as anyone who has read my previousrationalizations of the Bell Project, its principle feature was probably highmechanical and electromagnetic rotation, allied with the employment of highvoltage DC and AC potentials.45 Finally, as I have also pointed out in myprevious books, there was indeed an SS Entwicklungstelle IV, whose precisemission brief was the development of “free energy” technologies, that is, oftechnologies relying directly on the ability to draw energy from the physicalmedium.46To put it succinctly, all four of the basic implications of Jürgen-Ratthofer’sand Ettl’s assertions are in fact true.47D. The Curious Incident: Reinhard Schmidt’s Contact withGerman-Speaking UFO Occupants As if to reinforce all this high strangeness surrounding Nazis and UFOs, aNebraska farm broker and German-American, Reinhold O. Schmidt, had a extremelyunusual UFO encounter. He claimed to have been contacted by occupants of acigar-shaped UFO who spoke German! Of course, contactees all over the worldreport hearing such alleged occupants as speaking their own language or ofcommunicating with humans “telepathically,” so there is nothing unusual orsignificant in this fact alone. However, for his efforts, Mr. Schmidt wasrewarded with a stint in a psychiatric clinic. Furthermore, in an article in aWest German newspaper reporting the incident, the U.S. Air Force was apparentlysomewhat concerned about the event.1. Reinhold O. Schmidt’s Actual Account Schmidt’s actual account of his contact, however, deserves closer scrutiny, forit is divided into two distinct parts, the first dealing with his initialcontact, and the second, dealing with subsequent contacts. Reading the secondpart of Schmidt’s own account would convince anyone that the man may have beenmore than a little “out there,” as he recounts journeys with his German speakingspace-brothers to Russia, the North Pole (where he is feted to an early lectureon the dangers of global warming!), and to the Great Pyramid of Giza where theleader of the space-brothers, a “Mr. X,” uses a laser-beam-like device to gainentry into secret chambers inside the structure.image [images/00011.jpg] German Newpaper Articles About Reinhard Schmidt’s Contactwith German-Speaking UFO Occupants and His SubsequentHospitalization in a Psychiatric Clinic. Note the Reference to theAlarm of the U.S. Air Force But the first part of his short autobiographical account of his initial contact,“The Reinhold O. Schmidt Story: Cosmic Secrets Exposed: Edge of Tomorrow: TheTrue Account of Experiences with Visitors from Another Planet,” presents a farmore sobering picture, for it details his initial contact with sixGerman-speaking UFO occupants near Kearney, Nebraska on November 5, 1957.48Schmidt’s account has about it the air of plausibility for two reasons, thefirst being that he was a very careful observer of what he saw. And the secondbecause what he saw was clearly technological, but a technology not exoticenough to compel to the conclusion that it originated off this planet.a. The Malfunctioning Ignition and a Nazi and Fascist Parallel Schmidt begins by noting that after seeing a brilliant flash of light whiledriving back from work during the night, that his “car engine suddenly stopped.”He “turned the ignition off and on several times” but to no avail.49 Malfunctionof automobile electrical systems is, of course, a common feature of UFOencounters, and can be rationalized on the basis of conventional science as theresult of an electromagnetic pulse or exposure to strong electromagnetic fieldsthat basically “short out” electrical equipment in their vicinity.But as I have also pointed out in my previous book Secrets of the Unified Field,such devices were allegedly part of the secret weapons projects both of FascistItaly and of Nazi Germany.50 Thus, the conjunction of German-speaking occupantsof Schmidt’s UFO and its strange effects on his car serve to mutuallycorroborate the speculative possibility that Schmidt encountered some postwardescendant of those wartime secret projects. Schmidt’s encounter “with beingsfrom another world” can, in short, be scientifically rationalized by terrestrialtechnological antecedents.b. The Pencil Thin Beam of Light Schmidt then recounts that, having failed to turn his automobile engine back on,he exited his car and raised the hood, thinking perhaps that a wire had comeloose. As he did so, he noticed a large craft that looked like a “half-inflatedballoon” but which was made of metal, and which rested on “four hydraulic ramsserving as landing gear.” As he drew near the object,> A thin stream of light, about as big around as a pencil, shot out from it and> hit me across the chest. It seemed as if I were suddenly paralyzed; I could> not move. Maybe I was only scared stiff but, before I could analyze my> feelings, a door in the ship slid open and two men came out of it toward me.51 Again, one notes the resemblance of Schmidt’s technological description of thepencil thin beam of light to a piece of wholly terrestrial technology that wouldbecome public knowledge in a few short years: the laser. While Schmidt is clearthat his paralysis might have been his own emotional and physiological responseto this, it is also clear that he implies that it was the result of being struckwith the beam. While such a paralysis-inducing technology would have beenextraordinarily sophisticated for the day, it is now known that the Americanmilitary and intelligence services were working on methods of mind manipulationvia technological and pharmaceutical means during the same time frame. One needonly think of the CIA’s MK-Ultra project in this connection. Again, whilesophisticated for the day, nothing in Schmidt’s account thus far compels to theconclusion that his alleged encounter, if indeed it took place, representedcontact with an extraterrestrial race, civilization, or technology.c. “Inside the Ship” Shortly after this, Schmidt describes being invited into the ship by the leaderof its six occupants, a man he calls “Mr. X” and whom he describes as speaking“English with a German accent.”52> Besides the leader, there were three men and two women in the ship. The women> were sitting behind a big desk on which there was a large frame which enclosed> what looked like a viewing screen. At the same end of the ship were four> columns for colored liquid: red, green, blue and orange. These tubes were> approximately 4 and one half feet high and 6 inches in diameter. The ladies> seemed to be watching the liquid very closely as it moved slowly up and down,> like the pistons in an automobile. The three men were working on an instrument> panel that filled one side of the room. I saw one of them clipped off some> short wires. The panel was filled with clocks, dials, buttons and switches. In> the center was a large screen which looked like our televisions screens, but> it was not working while I was there.53 Wires, tubes, dials, clocks, switches, and colored liquid, being monitored by acrew of “men” and “women.” Schmidt’s language is not evocative of advancedextraterrestrial technology, and in fact serves to underscore the possibilitythat Schmidt actually did encounter what he describes.As if to underscore this even further, Schmidt even makes a fascinating (anddisturbing) observation about the “instrument panel” itself:> (It) had no name or identification which might have disclosed the place of> manufacture, but I did notice some Arabic numerals and some Roman numerals on> it. However, there were no other figures or letters of any kind on either the> inside or the outside of the ship.54 One would hardly expect, on an “advanced extraterrestrial craft” to encounterArabic and Roman numerals! Again, there is nothing exotic enough about thetechnology described to compel toward the conclusion that Schmidt hadencountered something extraterrestrial in origin.In fact, the exact opposite is the case. He had encountered somethingextraordinary, to be sure, but extraordinary precisely because every detail heelicits only serves to emphasize its human origins! Even Schmidt’s descriptionsthe odd way that the occupants seemed to glide rather than walk can be whollyrationalized on the basis of a now well-known terrestrial technology, for mostof those reading this book will have encountered teenagers gliding along asidewalk or pavement on tennis shoes equipped with roller wheels!55As if to highlight all the high strangeness of this unusual UFO contactee story,Schmidt makes the following observation:> When these people spoke among themselves they used high German, which I happen> to understand, as I graduated from a school in which both German and English> were taught. I could speak, read, and understand it fairly well. But these> people all spoke to me in English with a German accent.56 Schmidt, normally so careful an observer during the first part of his accountdoes not seem to ask nor answer the obvious questions: What were they talkingabout? Why did they assume he did not speak German? And most importantly, Whywere they speaking German? Why not Russian? French? Mandarin Chinese or Swahili?Why German?The implications of his assertions never seem to have occurred to him, but theyare clear, if true: he had witnessed some exotic terrestrial technology clearlytied to Germans and Germany…d. An Interesting Interest and Intriguing Observation At this juncture, Schmidt then recounts how the leader, “Mr. X,”> Asked me if I knew anything about the United States’ satellite program. When I> replied that I did not, he said, “They’re planning to send up some satellites,> but the first two will never leave the ground. The third will go up, but it> won’t send back data.”> This prophecy has since proved true. The results of those flights were printed> in newspapers all over the country.57 True enough, but once again the extraordinary implications of Schmidt’s storyseemed to have escaped him, for America’s satellite program at that point inhistory was highly classified. How then did Schmidt’s UFO occupants know aboutit? And more importantly, how did they know in advance what would happen withthe first flights? Schmidt’s “Mr. X” clearly has access to some insideknowledge…e. Departure When the craft’s crew finished whatever preparations they had been engaged in,they informed “Mr. X”, once again in German, that they were ready, and at thispoint “Mr. X” informed Schmidt that he had to leave.> As I stepped onto the ground, the motor started. It sounded like a large> electrical one, and it became quieter as it worked up momentum. It ran a few> seconds and then the ship took off… straight up in the air! About 12 feet off> the ground it turned pitch black. Then at about 100 feet it turned a> bluish-green and headed southwest. There was a brilliant flash, and then the> ship absolutely disappeared before my eyes! I estimated the ceiling of the> clouds that day to be only about 800 feet, but the ship had vanished at about> 150 feet. A county official told me later that the craft had stalled a> tractor, two cars, and a large truck… all of which had been beneath the path> of the ship during its takeoff.> During my first visit aboard the strange craft I had been told not to try to> start my car until the ship was out of sight, and that an attempt to do so> would be unsuccessful. Now I realized why my car had stalled earlier when I> first approached the ship.58 Other UFO contact reports, of course, record similar features, but what isnoteworthy here is that Schmidt describes a similar sight as witnessesdescribing the outdoor testing of the Nazi Bell device.59 And as I point out inmy book Secrets of the Unified Field, one and the same science can be used as abasis to explain and rationalize both the celebrated Philadelphia Experiment andthe alleged invisibility of the U.S. destroyer escort Eldridge as well as theNazi Bell.60 It is perhaps expedient to also point out that the Bell used aheavy maroon-violet liquid in the device, a fact loosely paralleled by theimplications of Schmidt’s observations of four colored liquids inside the UFO.f. The Authorities Get Involved Schmidt quickly returned to Kearney where he informed a local deputy sheriff ofthe whole episode. After the deputy informed Schmidt that an earlier sirenduring the daytime was because a local resident also reported seeing a “strangeobject in the sky,”61 Schmidt and the deputy returned to the spot along thePlatte River where he had experienced his encounter. There they noticed theimprints of the “four hydraulic rams on the dry bed of the Plate River” and someoil of a dark green color, “fine textured and sweet smelling.” Schmidt notablyremarks that he “could not be positive that it had come from the ship.”62 Thetwo men returned to Kearney and reported it all to the local chief of police.The police chief then contacted the City Attorney and a local newspaperreporter, and the three men along with Schmidt and the deputy returned to thesite in a police cruiser “with the siren going full blast all the way!”63 Thefour imprints of the landing gear legs were still visible, as was the dark greenoil. The deputy and Schmidt stepped off the distance between the landing gearimprints and “we estimated that the ship had been about 100 feet long and 30feet wide. I guessed its height to be about 14 feet.”64 Gathering up some of theoil for analysis, the group returned to Kearney, where Schmidt returned to hismotel to watch television in the lobby.While watching a local program it was suddenly interrupted by a news flashstating that a “spaceship” had landed at Kearney, Nebraska. Schmidt’s reactionto this announcement is significant:> I was very much surprised because nothing had been said to me about making an> announcement over the air. In fact, I had not even referred to the object as a> spaceship, because I didn’t know what it was. I thought that perhaps it might> have come from Russia, and that it was manned by a crew of German scientists> getting data on the first Russian Sputnik which had been launched about a week> before.65 In other words, Schmidt’s own original inclination was to interpret the craft assomething wholly terrestrial.And not only that.The story had begun to change.g. Schmidt Arrested and Committed At this juncture, Schmidt records events that clearly indicate that someone,somewhere, did not like what they were hearing coming out of Kearney, Nebraska,and that they took immediate steps to discredit both Schmidt and his story.> …I had become aware of the change in the manner of the officials as they> discussed my experience. Not only that, but the story they were now telling no> longer sounded the same at all!> Suddenly, about 6:00 a.m. they asked me to say that my experience had not> happened at all, and that it was a lie! They even asked that I change my story> to match theirs! I was dumbfounded at this turn of events. I told them that> they could tell whatever story they wanted to, but that I would not change> mine unless the truth would jeopardize the security of the United States. They> had no answer for that!66 After refusing to submit to a lie detector test unless the authorities did aswell, Schmidt was informed by the chief of police that he would be held in jail– without a warrant.67The next morning, the City Attorney visited Schmidt to inform him that they haddiscovered a half full can of dark green motor oil in the trunk of his car alongwith an oil funnel, proving that his story was made up.> I told him that he would have to think of a better one than that. I brought to> his attention the fact that the cans which he had showed (me had) circular> holes, and that the can opener I carried in my car cut a triangular hole.> Also, the two cans in question were the Veedol brand. The oil cans I carried> then (which are in my car), are RPM and Skelly.68 As if to highlight the possibility that the local authorities were beingpressured to railroad Schmidt through such clumsy evidence planting efforts,Kearney received two more distinguished visitors:> Two Air Force officials had arrived in Kearney during the night from Colorado. (That was fast!)> The next morning about eleven o’clock, November 6th, I was taken over to the> police station to talk with them. They recorded my whole experience on a tape> as I told it to them. During this session, one of the Kearney officials> happened to wonder out loud just how the ship could go straight up when it> took off. One of the Air Force men forgot himself for a moment and admitted,> “Oh, we know all about that.”69 Given what has been cited thus far, we are permitted to speculate what happened.Schmidt, after he had repeated his story to the local Chief of Police, and afterthe latter and other local officials had verified the story by checking out thelanding site, was ordered to be held by the Air Force until they could arrive onthe scene and investigate firsthand. In all likelihood the local authorities,after hearing Schmidt’s story – and particularly the detail about the Germanspeaking occupants – had probably contacted the nearest Air Force base toKearney, which at that time was most likely Offut Air Force Base south of Omaha,at that time also the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command. Offut then mostlikely contacted The North American Air Defense Command in Colorado Springs.While NORAD would not be officially founded until May 12th of the followingyear, most likely a skeletal command structure was already in place in Colorado.At any rate, regardless of how the contact between local officials and the AirForce was actually made, the fact remains that the Air Force showed up veryquickly, and doubtless exercised a great deal of influence in what happened nextto Schmidt, for he found himself hauled before a mental competency board onNovember 7th, and committed to a psychiatric hospital in Hastings, Nebraska.70After intervention from his employer and family who both attested his mentalworthiness, Schmidt was finally released.But the damage had been done: Schmidt’s story, which he refused to retract inspite of pressures to do so, was discredited.And this raises the possibility that the rest of Schmidt’s accounts ofsubsequent encounters – which partake so little of the same matter-of-factcharacter as the first half of his story, and which include many spectacular andfar-fetched elements – was itself deliberately concocted under pressureprecisely in order to discredit the first part.Whatever one makes of the Reinhold Schmidt contact affair, however, three thingsstand out as significant for our purposes:> 1) It was a story with a clear statement of contact with German speaking> occupants of a UFO;> 2) That UFO represented a technology clearly terrestrial, as evidenced by> Schmidt’s own descriptions of it, of its human operators, and of the very> human identifiers of “Arabic” and “Roman” numerals on some of its equipment,> and as well by Schmidt’s own inclination not to identify it as an> extraterrestrial spacecraft but as Russian in origin; and,> 3) The U.S. Air Force clearly was concerned about the story, since it took> self-evidently strong but covert measures to pressure Schmidt to change his> story, and when that failed, by discrediting it by having him involuntarily> committed to a psychiatric hospital. In this respect, the U.S. military’s> reaction to Schmidt’s story is of a piece to its reaction to Roswell, which as> I have speculated in my books Reich of the Black Sun and The SS Brotherhood of> the Bell, may have been the crash of something exotic, terrestrial, and Nazi,> for the crash of such a craft, able to enter sensitive American airspace with> impunity, would have sent the American military into a tailspin of panic, for> it meant that someone on earth was continuing a line of development of wartime> Nazi technology independent of any of the victorious Allies.71It is as if Reinhold Schmidt had either concocted a fictitious, or participatedin an actual, event to corroborate the assertions of Wilhelm Landig’s sciencefiction novels. There is just one problem… they hadn’t been written yet.2. The Rosin Affidavit: An Interpretive Context All this casts the affidavit of Dr. Carol Rosin, long-time American associate ofNazi Paperclip rocket scientist Wernher Von Braun, into a new light. Rosinclaimed that Von Braun told her that prior to his death in 1973 the world’selite had a long-range plan for the control and manipulation of the populationin response to various “perceived enemies:”> The strategy that Werner Von Braun taught me was that first the Russians are> going to be considered the enemy… Then terrorists would be identified, and> that was soon to follow… Then we were going to identify third-world country> “crazies.” We now call them Nations of Concern. But he said that would be the> third enemy against whom we would build space-based weapons. The next enemy> was asteroids. Now, at this point he kind of chuckled the first time he said> it. Asteroids – against asteroids we are going to build space-based weapons.> And the funniest one of all was what he called aliens, extraterrestrials.72 In the light of the foregoing discussion, however, Von Braun’s allegedstatements not only begin to acquire the ring of truth, but also raise thespecter that he “knew something” from long ago, something connected with thesecret projects under way in Nazi Germany. His remarks to Rosin raise thedistinct possibility that any such massive “ET” contact will in fact be amassive deception planned and orchestrated by humans, and based upon exoticthough quite secret technology, and made in aid of a sinister ideology: Nazism.E. Conclusions So what do we have?In the first instance, the Allied failure to demand a representative of the NaziParty to surrender, and their failure to demand that it abolish itself, affordeda clear loophole, not only legally, but more importantly, imaginatively, for thepostwar neo-Nazi movement to claim, on the basis of that omission, that theParty had survived the war, battered to be sure, but intact.In the fertile soil of that opportunity, aspects of the original esotericinfluences at work within the Party and more particularly, within Himmler’s SSgrew to encompass the myth of Nazi survival, and to elaborate it – as attestedby Landig’s novels – with a detail breathtaking and fantastic in its scope andparticulars. This elaboration, as was seen, included the following assertions:> 1) That the Reich government survived the war and that the Nazi Party had> never surrendered;> 2) that it based itself in Latin America;> 3) that secret bases were maintained, staffed by German scientists and former> SS and military personnel; in remote polar regions and remote areas of the> Andes mountains;> 4) that these bases also continued to pursue a line of technological and> scientific development of exotic technology tied to advanced propulsion and> aircraft (i.e., flying saucers), free energy, and the “ultimate doomsday> weapon”;> 5) that the organization had internationalized Nazism while retaining a> solidly German core, but welcoming new ethnic elements, particularly Muslim> Arabs and various Oriental groups; and finally,> 6) that the geopolitical agenda of this group was to create a third bloc of> nations in distinction to the two superpowers in conjunction with the creation> of an extraterritorial Nazi “state,” and that the continued independent> development and monopolization of the above-mentioned advanced technology was> crucial to that geopolitical agenda. As Landig indicated in the subtitle of his first novel, its main plot was “fullof realities” (voller Wirklichkeiten). How many of these “realities” are true,and to what extent, is the subject of the rest of this book.And the answers are not only surprising, but indeed supremely unsettling…1 Anthony Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,htto://reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/introduction.htm, p. 1.2 For the Allied Legend of Nazi nuclear incompetence. see my Reich of the BlackSun (Kempton, Illinois: Adventures Unlimited Press, 2004), pp. 3-158.3 See, for example, the “research” of the Institute for Historical Review.4 And they did recognize it de facto, since it was Dönitz’s radio broadcast ofthe surrender and his orders to the German Wehrmacht to cease hostilities, thatin fact performed the obligations of the surrender terms.5 Hitler had, before the war succeeded President Paul Hindenburg as“Reichspräsident” by passing a law that combined the offices of president andchancellor into that of Führer. In his last political will and testament, Hitlerrecreated the office of Reich President, while devolving the office ofchancellor upon Nazi propaganda minister Josef Göbbels. What exactly thisarrangement was supposed to mean was rather nebulous, but in the context of theWeimar constitution, the constitution under which the Nazi state came intoexistence, it gave Dönitz the real control of the government, since as Presidenthe could dissolve the Reichstag (a formality in any case, since it had longsince ceased to function), and appoint the Chancellor. Hitler also appointedDönitz as Staatsoberhaupt or Supreme Head of State, thus empowering him toconduct the foreign affairs of the Reich. More importantly, Hitler also namedDönitz as his successor as Oberbefehlshaber der deutschen Wehrmacht, SupremeCommander of the German Defense Force. In such capacities, then, Dönitz wasempowered to conduct foreign policy, to conclude the surrender of the GermanArmed Forces, and order that they cease operations and disarm.6 Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and thePolitics of Identity (New York University Press, 2002), pp. 128-129.7 Ibid., p. 129.8 Ibid.9 Ibid.10 See Tom Agoston’s Blunder!

The monks, allegedly, were in SS uniforms and hadcommitted ritual suicide. However, no monks were brought out during the Schäfferexpedition of 1939-39. It is known that Schäffer’s team brought out an entirepriceless copy of the ancient Tibetan epic collection, the Kang Schuur, and thismost likely would have required Tibetan assistance in translating the work. Ispeculate, therefore, that at some point during the war, most likely after theGerman invasion of Russia, that another secret SS expedition was undertaken toTibet with SS commandos who, once there, built an airfield for German long-rangeaircraft which in turn flew the monks back to Germany. The most likely time forsuch an expedition to have occurred would have been during the German long-rangearmed reconnaissance to Astrakhan on the Caspian Sea during the big Germanoffensive in Russia during the summer of 1942.19 Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun, pp. 137-138.20 Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun, pp. 142-143.21 Ibid., p. 143.22 Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun, p. 144.23 Ibid.24 Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun, p. 147.25 This is the same Friedrich Delitsch of the famous Keil and Delitsch series ofextensive biblical commentaries, a standard scholarly reference.26 I.e., “Babel and Bible.”27 Goodrick-Clarke, op.cit., p. 147.28 See also my book Reich of the Black Sun (Adventures Unlimited Press, 2004),pp. 161-179, and my book The Philosophers’ Stone (Feral House, 2009), pp.259-293 for further explorations of the theme of the connection between Naziesotericism and physics.29 Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun, p. 155.30 Ibid., p. 157.31 These later designs include the notorious – and in my opinion utterlyspurious – Hannebu and Vril flying saucers.32 Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun, p. 155.33 For a possible Sumerian context from which to view this interpretation, seemy The Cosmic War: Interplanetary Warfare, Modern Physics, and Ancient Texts(Adventures Unlimited Press, 2007), pp. 302-303.34 Marcionism was an early Christian heresy that taught that the God of the OldTestament could not have been the Father of Christ, since he was entangled withthe material world, which in the dualist thinking common to the pagan culture ofthe age, was tainted with evil.

While not unusual in and ofitself - after all, corporate bankruptcies often make front page news or leadstories in broadcasts - what was unusual about this bankruptcy, or rather,forced liquidation, was that it had been in the courts for fifty-one years! Andthat raises a rather obvious question: What corporation could be, or as the casemay be, could have been, so large and so powerful that it would take fifty-oneyears to complete? Not even A.T.& T., “Ma Bell,” took that long!The corporation’s name, however, says it all, for people who know its history,for it was the notorious Interessen-Gemeinschaft Farbenindustrie, A.G., betterknown as I.G. Farben, the gargantuan German chemicals cartel that was broken upat the end of World War Two into the “little” firms of Hoechst, Bayer, BASF(Bayrischen Analin und Soda-Fabrik), and AGFA (Aktien-Gesellschaft für AnalinFabrikation), each of which was and is a large “multinational” corporation inits own right. The fact that the components of I.G. Farben are so big gives anindicator of the size and power of the enormous Farben cartel.Farben was, by anyone’s reckoning, the corporation that ran Nazi Germany’senormous “military-industrial complex.”But size and power alone do not by themselves account for the extraordinarilylong time it took to finally be rid of the corporation. There are other factorsinvolved, one of which is the amount and type of compensation I.G. Farben or itssuccessors would pay its victims or their families for the Holocaust.Unfortunately, in the world of multi-national corporate amorality and greed,this factor played a small role.A much larger role was played by I.G. Farben’s prewar cartel and patentlicensing contracts with foreign corporations in the United Kingdom, France, andthe United States, and in that, as they say, lies an important story, for it isin the outlines of those arrangements and agreements that one may also discernthe form and shape that the Nazis’ postwar survival plans would follow. AndFarben’s system of cartel and license agreements also became in the prewarperiod part of a much larger pattern of international corporate cooperationbetween Nazi Germany and the Western Powers, particularly the United States.Hence, to understand the Nazi postwar survival plans, it is necessary to have anunderstanding of that prewar pattern.A. Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler` It was a former Hoover Institute scholar and fellow turnedconspiracy-theory-researcher, Anthony Sutton, whose trilogy of books, WallStreet and the Rise of FDR, Wall Street and the Rise of the Bolsheviks, and WallStreet and the Rise of Hitler, documented the existence of a powerfulinternational corporate elite, based in America, that was “fundamentallysignificant in the determination of world affairs, at a level far behind andabove that of the elected politicians.”2 Beginning with his work for the HooverInstitute, when Sutton was still a respected member of the academic community,he began to notice a curious fact about Soviet-American relations, namely, thatthe best American technology was being quietly shifted to the Soviet Unionthrough dubious trade agreements between the Russian Government and variousAmerican corporations. America was, in short, arming its enemy, and this was bydeliberate design! Sutton published a lengthy technical report for the HooverInstitute, and popularized his findings in a book titled The Best Enemy MoneyCan Buy. This fact earned Sutton the ire of the academic community and theirinternationalist corporate backers, and he soon found himself out of hisacademic fellowship and all but completely black-listed from the America’s“open-minded” and “brilliant” academic institutions.Undaunted, Sutton continued to document the work and goals of this corporateelite in a two-volume study Trilaterals Over Washington, and a ground-breakingwork on the notorious Skull and Bones Society at Yale University, America’sSecret Establishment. But it is for his trilogy culminating in Wall Street andthe Rise of Hitler that Sutton is best known, for it is perhaps the bestone-volume introduction to the shenanigans of American corporations and theirGerman counterparts in the rise of Nazism and Adolf Hitler.1. Putting it into Perspective: The Presumptive Goals of theInternational Elite in Funding Communism and Nazism But why would the same corporate elite wish to fund both Communism and Nazism,and to put them into power in two of the world’s great military powers to beginwith? There are two answers to this question, one long-term, and one more mid-to short-term. As the titles of Sutton’s own Wall Street and the Rise Of…trilogysuggests, by placing into power Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Adolf Hitler, andVladimir Lenin, the international elite was running a grand long-termexperiment, not only in bringing socialism of one form or another into authorityin the major powers of the world, but also to determine which version ofsocialism was the most robust in opposing a presumed threat, but also todetermine the most pliable and easily manipulated by corporate elites. The longterm goal was, of course, world corporate socialism.The more short term reasons for this manipulation of three kinds of socialism –FDR’s “New Deal” socialism, Communist Socialism, and National Socialism – ismore complex, and must be viewed from the chronological standpoint. Having putBolshevism into power, the internationalist corporate elite soon found itselffaced with a problem, namely, that the Soviet Union and its CommunistInternational was serious about expanding communist power – under Sovietauspices – around the world, and particularly into central Europe and Germany.Faced with the possibility of a power bloc centered on Russia and Germany underCommunist control, the ability to manipulate and control that bloc – much lessoppose it if the need arose – became quite problematical, if not downrightimpossible. In short, the balance of power, upon which the larger schemedepended, would have been threatened.Having created the Communist monster, the elite then decided to finance anothermonster – Nazism – to oppose it. This plan was indeed realistic, since Germanywas the only power conceivably in a position to oppose Russia economically andmilitarily.3 France and Great Britain simply had neither the muscle nor thegeopolitical position to do it, and the United States was ill-disposed to becomeinvolved in European affairs. As a result of these considerations, the patternof international corporate cartel and licensing arrangements between the WesternPowers – particularly the United States – and Germany emerged.2. A Case in Point: Hitler’s Reichsbank President: Dr. HjalmarHorace Greeley Schacht An example of this American-German corporate cooperation is easily seen inHitler’s first Reichsbank President, Dr. Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht. AsSutton observes, the pattern of incestuous relationships between the German andAmerican corporate elites is exemplified in Schacht, for Schacht’s father, priorto moving his family to America,> Worked at the Berlin office of the Equitable Trust Company of New York in the> early twentieth century. Hjalmar was born in Germany rather than New York only> by the accident of his mother’s illness, which required the family to return> to Germany…To record his American origins, Hjalmar’s middle names were> designated “Horace Greeley” after the well-known Democrat politician.> Consequently, Hjalmar spoke fluent English and the post-war interrogation of> Schacht in project Dustbin was conducted in both German and English. The point> to be made is that the Schacht family had its origins in New York, worked for> the prominent Wall Street financial house of Equitable Trust (which was> controlled by the Morgan firm), and throughout his life Hjalmar retained these> Wall Street connections. Newspapers and contemporary sources record (his)> repeated visits with Owen Young of General Electric; Farish, chairman of> Standard Oil of New Jersey; and their banking counterparts. In brief, Schacht> was a member of the international financial elite… He is a key link between> the Wall Street elite and Hitler’s inner circle.4 Remember that connection to the Morgan financial interests, since it willresurface in a strange way once we examine the postwar financial plans of theNazi International.3. International Cartel and Licensing Agreements Between I.G. Farben andAmerican Corporations According to Sutton, “The contribution made by American capitalism to German warpreparations before 1940 can only be described as phenomenal.”5 Just howphenomenal? Consider only the fact that> In 1935 Germany produced domestically only 300,000 tons of natural petroleum> products and less than 800,000 tons of synthetic gasoline; the balance was> imported. Yet, ten years later in World War II, after transfer of the Standard> Oil of New Jersey hydrogenation patents and technology to I.G. Farben (used to> produce synthetic gasoline from coal), Germany produced about 6 ½ million tons> of oil – of which 85 percent (5 ½ million tons) was synthetic oil using the> Standard Oil hydrogenation process. Moreover, the control of synthetic oil> output in Germany was held by the I.G. Farben suibsidiary, Barunkohle-Benzin> A.G., and this Farben cartel itself was created in 1926 with Wall Street> financial assistance.6 What did America get in return for Farben’s license to produce syntheticgasoline under Standard Oil’s patent? More about that in a moment.a. The Dawes and Young Plans In order to appreciate the German cartel system and its unique power in worldfinance capitalism at the time, however, it is necessary to go back to the endof World War One, the Versailles Treaty, and the enormous war reparations itimposed on Germany.7 Since World War One had left the world’s gold standard allbut shattered in a tapestry of loans and credits, the outcome was predictable,particularly in Germany’s case: the German government simply could not pay thereparations in any timely and meaningful fashion, and began deliberately toinflate its currency, paying the Allies back with increasingly worthlessReichsmarks, and ruining its own economy in the process as factories shut downand unemployment soared.It was clear that something had to be done, and the only country at that timethat could do it was the only creditor nation in the world with enough liquidcapital worth anything to loan: the United States. It is in this context thatthe 1924 Dawes Plan and the 1928 Young Plan emerged as the latest scheme ofinternational capitalists to milk Germany for all she was worth, for the ruin ofthe Reichsmark provided them with a golden opportunity “to float profitableloans” with valuable American dollars to the “German cartels in the UnitedStates.”8 Both of these plans “were engineered by these central bankers, whomanned the committees for their own pecuniary advantages, and althoughtechnically the committees were not appointed by the U.S. Government, the planswere in fact approved and sponsored by the Government.”9The essence of both plans was that the large U.S. central banks floated Germanbond issues which were paid for by American dollars. In turn, part of thesefunds were then used by Germany to repay the war reparations imposed by theVersailles Treaty. But as Sutton also notes, under these two plans> Germany paid out to the Allies about 86 billion marks in reparations. At the> same time Germany borrowed abroad, mainly in the U.S., about 138 billion marks> – thus making a net German payment of only three billion marks for reparations> (sic). Consequently, the burden of German monetary reparations to the Allies> was actually carried by foreign subscribers to German bonds issues by Wall> Street financial houses – at significant profits for themselves, of course.10 As will be seen in a moment, much of these funds were actually used by theGerman corporations borrowing them to create the cartel system that dominatedlate Weimar Germany and that continued throughout the Nazi era.It was the Young Plan, however, that began the process of waking Germancapitalists and industrialists up to the threat, for it was a clever, andinsidious, adaptation of this bonds-for-loans scheme that constituted the DawesPlan, for under the 1928 Young Plan – named after its sponsor Owen Young – thebonds were conceived as “a device to occupy Germany with American capital andpledge German real assets for a gigantic mortgage held in the United States.”11There was, of course, predictably a loophole granted to this scheme, for “Germanfirms with U.S. affiliations evaded the Plan by the device of temporary foreignownership.”12 Thus, the Allgemeine Elektricitäts Gesellschaft, or A.E.G., GermanGeneral Electric, which was of course affiliated with General Electric in theUnited States, was “sold to a Franco-Belgian holding company and evaded theconditions of the Young Plan.”13 And lest it be forgotten – for it is animportant part of the subsequent story in this book – the A.E.G. was also theGerman firm that built the power plant for the Nazi Bell device.14If the financial “arrangements” of the Young Plan sound all too familiar, theyought to, for a similar phenomenon is happening with the corporate and publicassets of the United States in recent years, as public infrastructure ismortgaged to private interests to manage the U.S.A.’s burgeoning national debt.But America’s internationalist capitalist-socialist elite had not banked –pardoning the pun – on one thing, and it is a lesson they seem to haveforgotten: not all German cartelists and industrialists were loathe to abandonpatriotism or pride in their culture and nation. Indeed, German steel magnateFritz Thyssen observed that he “turned to the National Socialist Party onlyafter (he) became convinced that the fight against the Young Plan wasunavoidable if complete collapse of Germany was to be prevented.”15 Clearly, ifall real German assets were tied up in international agreements that wereessentially mortgages, and these in turn were woven into an intricate pattern ofmounting debt, then Germany’s days as a sovereign nation were numbered.Thyssen’s comment also contains an implied warning about the activities of thepostwar Nazi International, for if the international corporate elite was slow toappreciate the dangers of their activities in fomenting a resistance movementwithin its own ranks, and slow to appreciate the dangers of nationalist backlashin its ranks, the Nazis, as we shall see in subsequent chapters, were not onlyalive to the possibility, but also learned to exploit those internationalistleanings within the global financial world for themselves.In any case, the American loans that were floated to German cartels under thesePlans were enormous. A.E.G. received $35,000,000 from National City Co., theenormous German steel cartel Vereinigte Stahlwerke (United Steelworks) received$70,225,000 of underwritten securities from the Wall Street firm of Dillon,Read, and Co., and American I.G. Chemical, I.G. Farben’s American subsidiary,was the go-between for a loan of $30,000,000 from National City Co.16What this meant in terms of German business was that two of these three giantcartels – I.G. Farben and Vereinigte Stahlwerke – were able to control almostall business related to German war-making industrial potential by the mid-1920s.Sutton puts it this way:> After the mid-1920s the two major German combines of I.G. Farben and> Verienigte Stalhwerke dominated the chemical and stell cartel system created> by these loans. Although these firms had a voting majority in the cartels for> only two or three basic products, they were able – through control of these> basics – to enforce their will throughout the cartel. I.G. Farben was the main> producer of basic chemicals used by other combines making chemicals, so its> economic power position cannot be measured by its capacity to produce a few> basic chemicals. Similarly, Verienigte Stahlwerke, with a pig-iron capacity> greater than that of all other German iron and steel producers combined, was> able to exercise far more influence in the semifinished iron and steel> products cartel than its capacity for pig-iron production suggests. Even so> the percentage output of these cartels for all products was significant: image [images/00013.jpg]17 With some justification, then, it could be said that these two cartelsrepresented the core of Nazi Germany’s military-industrial complex: “In brief,in synthetic gasoline and explosives (two of the very basic elements of modernwarfare), the control of German World War II output was in the hands of twoGerman combines created by Wall Street loans under the Dawes Plan.”18 I.G.Farben in fact dates from 1925 when its chairman, Hermann Schmitz, created thegiant cartel by merging “six already giant German chemical companies,” BadischeAnilin, Bayer, Agfa, Hoechst, Weiler-ter-Meer, and Griesheim-Elektron.19 By1928, Schmitz had organized its American holding companies – American Bayer,General Anilin Works, Agfa Ansco, and Winthrop Chemical – into a parent Swissholding company, I.G. Chemie, and in 1929 all these firms were merged to becomeAmerican I.G. Chemical Corporation, “later renamed General Aniline & Film.”20But this barely scratches the surface.Between 1927, only two years after the founding of the cartel, and the outbreakof the war in 1939, I.G. Farben had more than doubled in size. The Wall Streetfinanciers who made the loans to Hermann Schmitz to form this cartel had indeedcreated a monster, and that monster, in turn, was not proving to be ascooperative or pliable as they might have wished:> By 1939 I.G. acquired a participation and managerial influence in some 380> other German firms and over 500 foreign firms. The Farben empire owned its own> coal mines, its own electric power plants, iron and steel units, banks,> research units, and numerous commercial enterprises. There were over 2,000> cartel agreements between I.G. and foreign firms – including Standard Oil of> New Jersey, DuPont, Alcoa, Dow Chemical, and others in the United States. The> full story of I.G. Farben and its world-wide activities before World War II> can never be known, as key German records were destroyed in 1945 in> anticipation of Allied victory.21 Small wonder, then, that it took over fifty years to liquidate the company!Indeed, Sutton’s observation that key German corporate records were deliberatelydestroyed at the end of the war raises the key question of what in Farben’stapestry of cartel agreements, corporate interlock, and influence in othercorporations was so sensitive that it had to be hidden from the Allies?In any case, these cartel arrangements were used by I.G. Farben to prepareGermany for war, both by acquiring technologies from abroad under licensingagreements, but also to deny Germany’s enemies the ability to rely on similartechnologies in their own war production. Case in point: under Farben’slicensing agreements, the giant cartel obtained from Standard Oil of New JerseyAmerica’s process for making synthetic gasoline in return for a license toStandard Oil for Farben’s synthetic rubber or “buna”-making technology.22 Butthe power of the corporation was such that, while it used Standard Oil’stechnology to make gasoline and oil for Hitler’s tanks, bombers, and warships,it denied the Americans the ability to produce much-needed synthetic rubber,throughout and right up to the very end of the war! Additionally, Farben’sglobal extent and penetration into foreign firms also provided it with a readysupply of very reliable intelligence on Germany’s enemies’ war productioncapabilities and production runs, affording Germany a very clear picture of herenemies’ military intentions.But the important point to notice here, and it is one that Sutton himself – notto mention Farben’s elitist Wall Street backers - only hints at, is that I.G.Farben, while a “multinational global corporation” in every modern sense, was acorporation acting always around a solidly German core and in the Germannational interest. Sutton puts it this way, and in so doing, soft-pedals itsenormous implications: “These arrangements were used by I.G. Farben to advanceNazi policy abroad, to collect strategic information, and to consolidate aworld-wide chemical cartel.”23 It was a lesson the Nazi International wouldlearn well.So organized was Farben’s intrinsic rebellion against the very Americaninternational financial interests that set it up, that it had its own espionageoffice, its Berlin N.W. 7 office. This unit “operated under Farben director MaxIlgner, nephew of I.G. Farben president Hermann Schmitz. Max Ilgner and HermannSchmitz were on the board of American I.G., with fellow directors Henry Ford ofFord Motor Company, Paul Warburg of Bank of Manhattan,24 and Charles F. Mitchellof the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.”25 Given Farben’s behavior as a Germanmultinational cartel, the presence of these prominent American executives on itsAmerican subsidiary’s board can only represent the presence of dupes; Farben wasplaying Wall Street for all it was worth. Indeed, Farben far exceeded WallStreet’s desires simply to have Nazi Germany act as a counter-balance to SovietRussia, for it “did more than just comply with orders from the Nazi regime.Farben was an initiator and operator for the Nazi plans for world conquest…Infact, the (German) Army only rarely had to approach Farben; it is estimated thatabout 40 to 50 percent of Farben projects for the Army were initiated by Farbenitself.”26 Farben was not content to play the Wall Street role of geopoliticalcounterbalance, and when Nazi Germany had overrun most of Europe by May of 1941,it was clear even to the Wall Street blockheads that had put both into power,that both monsters – Nazi Germany and I.G. Farben – had to be put down. Butputting it down was not going to be easy, for consider all that has been statedthus far in terms of what power I.G. Farben actually wielded: it had penetratedthe Federal Reseve Bank of New York (Charles Mitchell and Paul Warburg),penetrated Ford Motor Company (Henry and later Edsel Ford), penetrated the Bankof Manhattan (Paul Warburg), and Standard Oil of New Jersey, just to mention afew.27There is also another fact worth mentioning, as it will play a prominent rolemuch later in this book when we examine the postwar scientific activities of theNazi International, and that is the presence of “one of the more prominentFarben intelligence workers in N.W. 7,” the Netherlands’ Prince Bernhard, thefounder of the famous Bilderberger group.284. I.T.&T. and Nazi Germany Another American multinational corporate giant that will figure prominently inlater sections of this book was International Telephone and Telegraph, foundedin 1920 by Sosthenes Behn.29 Behn, with Morgan backing, purchased Spain’stelephone monopoly, Compania Telefonica de Espana, in 1923, and thus began theI.T.& T. empire.30 While there is no evidence that I.T.&T. supported the rise ofHitler prior to the war to the extent that other Wall Street firms did, I.T.& T.certainly supported him during the war, since it made payments to none otherthan Heinrich Himmler via various I.T.& T. German subsidiaries.31 Moreimportantly, through its purchase of a large interest in the German Focke-Wulfeaircraft company, I.T.& T. was making profits from the German Focke-Wulfe 190fighter, Germany’s most numerous and successful fighter, the better of theBritish Spitfire and the near equal of the American P-51 Mustang!32B. A Brief Note About Prescott Bush, Union Banking Corporation,and Fritz Thyssen With the prominence of the Bush family in American politics and scandals, fromthe recent Savings and Loan scandal to the JFK assassination itself, where a G.Bush is mentioned in connection with trying to warn about the assassination, tothe possible involvement of G.H.W. Bush in the “October Surprise” affair, hisrole as an ambassador to Red China and helping broker the Nixon-Mao agreementthat would ship American factories, jobs, and technology to that country, hisrole as a former director of the CIA, and his family’s business ties to the BinLaden family of Saudi Arabia, and of course to his and his sons’ questionablelegacies as Presidents of the United States and also as members of the famousSkull and Bones secret society at Yale University, it should come as no surprisethat his family also has a connection to the rise of Nazism under Adolf Hitler.While most are probably familiar with this story, it is worth rehearsing itsbare outlines again here, as an indicator of just how pervasive, extensive, andhigh-up the connections between Nazism and the American elite really are. Infact it is a story that will not go away, as a multi-billion dollar lawsuit hasbeen brought against the Bush family by two survivors of the Holocaust.33> While there is no suggestion that Prescott Bush34 was sympathetic to the Nazi> cause, the documents reveal that the firm he worked for, Brown Brothers> Harriman, acted as a US base for the German industrialist, fritz Thyssen, who> helped finance Hitler in the 1930s before falling out with him at the end of> the decade. The Guardian has seen evidence that shows Bush was the director of> the New York-based Union Banking Corporation that represented Thyssen’s US> Interests and he continued to work for the bank after America entered the> war.35 The Guardian’s commentary is more balanced than the usual conspiracy mongeringor Bush-bashing that one finds on the internet or in several books, for itpoints out the fact that Prescott Bush’s connection to Thyssen was indirect, andalso points out that Thyssen himself became quite disenchanted with the Nazisonce they were in power, even to the extent of serving time in a concentrationcamp.That said, however, there was enough evidence in recently declassified U.S.National Archives documents to prompt “one former US war crimes prosecutor toargue that the late senator (Prescott Bush’s) action should have been groundsfor prosecution for giving aid and comfort to the enemy.”36 Whatever thelegalities of the hypothetical case may be – and there are many as will be seenshortly – the documents themselves tell an interesting story. There are threebasic sets, the first dealing with the Harriman company, and Prescott Bush’srole as a director and shareholder in several Thyssen-controlled firms.37 Thesecond set of documents relates to the seizure of company assets in America thatwere fronts for German firms: The Union Banking Corporation, theHolland-American Trading Corporation, the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation,and the Silesian-American Company, all of which were ventures tied to PrescottBush.38 The third set of documents relates specifically to I.G. Farben and itsties to Thyssen’s Silesian steel and mining operations.The fact that Prescott Bush may or may not have been involved with people whohelped the Nazis into power is from one standpoint immaterial, for one canhardly blame either Presidents Bush for the actions of their father orgrandfather. Similarly, the fact that Thyssen himself grew disgusted with theNazis hardly makes the case for Prescott Bush being a Nazi sympathizer anystronger either. Finally, the fact that Bush’s company’s assets were only seizeda mere six months after America’s entry into the war does not say much either,since in that short time period American corporations were – at least in theory– supposed to be disentangling themselves from any trade with the enemy (unlessone was Standard Oil or I.T.&T., of course). Prescott Bush’s business dealingswith the Nazis hardly have the odor about them that those other Wall Streetfirms and personalities, already mentioned at some length in this chapter, do.It is only when viewed in a much wider context of the Bush family’s contacts andbusiness dealings – a task far beyond the scope of this book – that PrescottBush’s activities with Thyssen might be seen as part of a larger pattern.And then there is that matter of the Bush family’s purchase of a ranch, not inthe U.S.A., Canada, Australia, or the usual contenders, but in Paraguay. Perhapsthey like the scenery. Or perhaps they want to be near old family friends…C. Conclusions If there is a lesson to be learned from I.G. Farben’s “story,” then it is oneall - whether corporate financiers or ordinary men – should learn, and that isthat the best laid plans of international bankers with a global agenda not onlycan backfire, they can backfire in the major ways called Nazi Germany, I.G.Farben, and World War Two.But there was another lesson to be learned from I.G. Farben’s success story asthe world’s first real major military-industrial complex, for its pattern ofinternationalization of the Nazi ideology around a solidly German core would bewell-learned by the man who had the most high-level day-to-day contact with it:Nazi Party Reichsleiter Martin Bormann. Just how closely he followed the Farbenmodel of internationalizing the ethnic character of postwar Nazism around asolid German core, and using Farben’s pattern of cartel arrangements, corporateinterlock and penetration, and blackmail, and the well-placed assassination ortwo, remains to be seen…1 Jim Marrs, The Rise of the Fourth Reich: The Secret Societies that Threaten toTake Over America (William Morrow, 2008), p. 118.2 Anthony Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/introduction.htm, p. 1.3 In my experience, most Americans are so ill-informed about history that theydo not realize that Russia surrendered to Germany in March, 1918. While theMenshevik socialist government of Russia wished to continue the war withimperial Germany, militarily this was all but a foregone conclusion, as theRussian armies were hopelessly outclassed and outgunned. The Eastern Front ofWorld War One had become a slaughter-house for the Russians. Under the terms ofthe Russian surrender negotiated with the new Bolshevik government, Germanywould occupy vast tracts of Byelo-Russia and the Ukraine, as well as what wouldlater become the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. The Russiansurrender made possible the transfer of large amounts of troops to the WesternFront for the large German offensive in March of 1918 that nearly broke the backof French and British resistance. The offensive was led by General ErichLudendorff, a subsequent earlier supporter of the Nazi Party.4 Anthony Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hiter,theology.org/html/books/wall_street/introduction.htm, p. 4,5 Anthony Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_01.htm, p. 1.6 Ibid.7 These reparations were largely insisted upon by France, which bore theeconomic brunt, infrastructure damage, and dislocation of the war. In doing so,however, France was not acting uniquely nor without precedent, since the GermanEmpire had imposed similar reparations on France at the end of theFranco-Prussian War in 1871. The French Third Republic repaid these reparations.8 Anthony Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_01.htm, p. 2.9 Ibid.10 Ibid., p. 3.11 Anthony Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_01.htm, p. 4, emphasisadded.12 Ibid.13 Ibid.14 See my SS Brotherhood of the Bell, pp. 155-156.15 Anthony Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_01.htm, p. 4.16 Ibid., p. 6.17 Anthony Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitlter,reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_01.htm, pp. 7-8.18 Ibid., p. 8.19 Anthony Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_02.htm, p. 1.20 Ibid.21 Ibid., p. 2, emphasis added.22 Anthony Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_01.htm, p. 523 Ibid., p. 4.24 And also, let it be noted, a former director of the New York Federal ReserveBank.25 Anthony Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_01.htm, p. 4.26 Ibid., p. 727 Ibid., p. 1228 Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_02.htm, p. 4.29 Ibid., reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_05.htm, p. 1.30 Ibid.31 Ibid.32 Ibid.

Schmidt, U.S. Department of the Treasury,> Commenting on the Bormann’s Strategic Evacuation Plan1 Between February and August of 1943 the military fate of Adolf Hitler’s ThousandYear Third Reich was sealed in a series of military operations that almostboggle the imagination. After the surrender of the encircled German Sixth Armyat Stalingrad on February 2nd, STAVKA, the Soviet High Command, gambledeverything in a massive counteroffensive designed no less than to drive fourmassive columns westward, and then sweep south to the Black Sea, cutting off andencircling the entire German Army Group South. Four Soviet armies and massivearmored formations were committed to the effort.Unfortunately for the Soviets, Hitler had entrusted the command of Army GroupSouth to Field Marshal Erich Von Manstein, the man whose unorthodox plan had ledto the quick Nazi victory over France in 1940, and whose Eleventh Army hadpulverized the Russian fortress of Sevastopol on the Black Sea in 1942.2 As thelead Soviet reconnaissance columns were within only five miles of Von Manstein’sArmy Group Headquarters at Zaporozhe on the bend of the Dnieper River, one ofVon Manstein’s staff officers heard the Field Marshal mutter under his breath ashe watched the relentless advance of red arrows on the situation map, “And thebest of luck to you.” A month later, Von Manstein’s carefully orchestratedwithdrawal and counter-offensive had eliminated all four Soviet armies and sentthe Red Army reeling back to essentially the same lines as those from which theGermans had started their 1942 offensive.3There was one problem: an enormous bulge or salient stretched into German linescentered around Kursk, with the Germans occupying Orel to the north and Belgoradto the south. The Russians quickly began to fortify the salient, committing thebulk of their artillery and armored reserves to the area, and the Germansresponded in kind, building up a massive pool of armor, artillery, and aircraftfor an offensive to encircle the Russians. Hitler opened his offensive on July5, 1943. When it was all over, the Germans had lost almost 50,000 men, 300tanks, and 200 aircraft. The Soviets fared much worse, losing almost ten timesas many men, three times as many tanks, and an unknown amount of aircraft in thelargest land, tank and air battle in history.4However, numbers do not tell the whole story, for the Germans, the offensivebroke the back of the Wehrmacht’s offensive capability for good; for theSoviets, massive though their losses were, were able to shift to the offensive,never to let up until their tanks rolled into Berlin in 1945. The mood in Berlinas these events from Stalingrad to Kursk unfolded was indeed somber, and one whowatched them all with a cool eye to the future was Adolf Hitler’s personalsecretary and chosen leader of the Nazi Party, Reichsleiter Martin Bormann.A. The Beginnings of Evacuation: Operation Fireland Bormann was nothing if not a cynical realist.With the military disaster of Stalingrad, Bormann and other top Nazi leadersbegan the quiet though “disorganized” flight of capital from Nazi Germany tosafe havens abroad, an operation codenamed Aktion Feuerland, Operation Fireland.> The treasure consisted of hundreds of millions of reichsmarks; boxes and boxes> of gold and platinum, pearls and diamonds; crates full of the priceless art of> Europe; and billionaire bundles of stocks and other securities. The loot was> amassed in a series of bank safes and underground vaults throughout the Reich> – until Martin Bormann was made aware of its existence by one of his many> internal intelligence conduits. In late 1943, he took control of much, though> not all, of this booty and informed Hitler of its existence and a plan he had> formulated for its conservation.> “Bury your treasure, for you will need it to begin a Fourth Reich,” Hitler had> responded. With this blessing, Bormann took control of as many as six U-boats,> some of them unmarked, from Gross Admiral Karl Doenitz, and garnered the> support of Generalissimo Francisco Franco to headquarter the U-boats in the> Spanish port cities of Cadiz and Vigo. The U-boats for the next two years,> supplied by cargo planes from Germany that transported the treasures to the> coastal towns on the Atlantic, began a non-stop circuit transporting the> treasure to the far southern reaches of Argentina – the region known as Tierra> del Fuego, or Land of Fire. At their destinations they were unloaded by> Bormann’s mysterious minions and deposited into a variety of international> bank accounts controlled by a cryptic cabal of Bormann partners. This was> Operation Fireland.5 With Aktion Feuerland one sees the outlines of the postwar Nazi evacuationtaking shape, and in this respect, the following things should be noted:> 1) An escape route through Franco’s Nationalist Spain;> 2) Reliance upon unmarked or “black” U-boats for the shipment (shades of> Wilhelm Landig once again!);> 3) Deposit of Nazi treasures into “international bank accounts;” and,> 4) Implied Argentine complicity at the other end of the escape route. Each of these four points will, of course, be explored in this book.B. Operation Bernhard Bormann was nothing if not criminally ingenious. In 1942, for example, hesponsored the top secret Project Bernhard, an effort by Nazi Germany tocounterfeit British pound notes and circulate them. The plan was double-edged,designed both to cripple the British war economy and to provide much-needed hardcash for Nazi Germany’s own war efforts. Researcher Carter Hydrick hasestablished that at its height, the project was printing 400,000 British notesper month, and that on its conclusion, some $600,000,000 worth of counterfeitBritish pounds had been circulated.6 Bormann would deposit these funds inforeign banks through his business contacts, and then exchange the funds forother hard currencies, usually dollars. Rather than divert all these funds backinto the Nazi war economy, however, Bormann would skim his own cut and squirrelit away for his own use at a future date. Hydrick notes that “of the $600million of counterfeit currency processed, approximately $300 million has neverbeen accounted for, presumably lost to Bormann’s enigmatic interchange.”7C. The Hotel Maison Rouge Meeting: Operations Regentröpfchenand Adlerflug It was after the successful Allied invasion of the beaches of Normandy, France,however, that the long-range postwar Nazi corporate planning began in earnest.To understand Bormann and his postwar plans, it is necessary to understand hisrise to power and methods of operation.1. The Growth of Bormann’s Power and International Network Long time CBS journalist Paul Manning, an associate of that network’s mostfamous newsman, Ed Morrow, summarized Martin Bormann’s personality and abilityin the following words:> Bormann was a classic embodiment of the dictator in the antechamber, a type> now usual in governments around the world and in the multinational> corporations, which usually tell governments what to do. Those who scorned him> were typical stalwarts of every revolutionary movement, the old guard of> faithful fighters, the populists, who assume their early success will endure> unchangingly. Great individuals build up great corporations; but it is the> second generation of professional managers to whom shareholders look to carry> on the tradition of expansion and profits. Martin Bormann was a second> generation professional who consolidated for Hitler the power he had> accumulated. He was at ease in the bureaucratic apparatus and mastered the> mechanisms of government with the greatest skill.8 Bormann, in short, was a professional Nazi, aiming to maintain the Party, itspower, and agenda and to give its institutions and goals permanence.Once Adolf Hitler had appointed Bormann to be Rudolf Hess’s chief of staff andalso Nazi Party treasurer, the rest, for the financially brilliant Bormann, washistory. Even before he replaced Hess as Party Reichsleiter after the latter’sill-fated flight to Britain, Bormann was the de facto mover and governor of theParty machinery and finances. Quickly gaining power of attorney over Hitler’spersonal finances, he arranged for every picture of Hitler on a postage stampthroughout the Reich to pay the Führer a personal royalty for the use of hisimage, a maneuver that soon made Hitler a very wealthy man in his own right. Asparty treasurer, Bormann soon controlled the housekeeping budgets for “Hitlerhimself and his girlfriend Eva Braun, as well as for Goering, Goebbels, andHimmler.”9 By 1938, in fact, Bormann was in control of all of Hitler’s financialbusiness, leaving the Führer to the more important tasks of running the country.After Rudolf Hess’s flight to England in May, 1941, Bormann’s career as aprofessional Nazi stepped into high gear. Bormann was named by Hitler to replaceHess as Party Reichsleiter and Party Chancellor.> The wording was brief and low key, but it marked a giant leap forward for> Martin Bormann. Henceforth, the entire party ministry would be under him.> Every Nazi within Germany, in occupied Europe, and overseas was answerable> directly to him. Within the year Hitler added to Bormann’s titles those of> Secretary to the Fuehrer and Lieutenant General of the SS.10 As Party Reichsleiter, Bormann headed the Nazi Party’s Auslands—Organization,the overseas party offices and network established prior to the Nazi assumptionof power to keep Germans abroad abreast of developments in the Party, and ofcourse, to keep a watchful eye on their activities and that of their hostcountries. In short, the Nazi Party leadership gave Bormann access not only toall of Nazi Germany’s political, military, and financial wheeler-dealers, italso gave him control over its own independent Party international espionage andfifth column network.11 Most importantly, all German businesses abroad wererequired, once the Nazis took power, to have their own Nazi PartyAuslands-Organization liaison men, a fact that will assume some importance whenwe examine Bormann’s strategic evacuation plans and postwar agendas for the NaziInternational. In particular, all employees of the big three German banks,Deutschebank, Dresdnerbank, and Commerzbank, were required to be partymembers.12 In this way Bormann had up to the minute and excellent intelligenceon the international machinations of the global corporate elites.As Manning astutely observes, Bormann> Inherited this vast intelligence and fifth-column system upon assuming> leadership of the party. He tightened it up and instilled it with a new> purpose; it became an instrument used to implement his flight capital program> in the last few months of the war.13 2. Bormann and I. G. Farben But it was Bormann’s friendship with I.G. Farben directors Hermann Schmitz, MaxIlgner, and others that gave him access to Farben’s far more extensiveindustrial espionage network, and that additionally provided him with thecorporate networks needed to make his flight capital plan work. Manning pointsout that one city, in particular, was a veritable beehive of banking activity onbehalf of I.G. Farben, Verieinigte Stahlwerke, A.E.G., Merck, Siemens, and otherbig German cartels: Buenos Aires.14 With the financial and corporate knowledgeFarben placed at his disposal, with the control of the Nazi Party’s ownconsiderable finances and plunder, with his own Party network of agents and“enforcers” in place, Bormann “now had a vast overseas financial and commercialnetwork to do his bidding.”15 It only remains to see what his bidding was.3. The Hotel Maison Rouge Meeting and Their Grand Design On August 10, 1944 an SS staff car flying the Nazi swastika and SS flags fromits bumpers pulled up in front of the Hotel Maison Rouge located on the Rue desFrance-Bourgeois in Strasbourg, nestled along the French banks of the Rhineriver separating Alsace from Baden-Würtemburg. It carried one SSObergruppenführer Scheid, who doubled as Dr Scheid, “director of the industrialfirm of Hermadorff & Schenburg Company.”16 Dr. Sheid had been ordered to chair atop secret conference of German industrialists at the picturesque Alsatian cityby none other than Reichsleiter Martin Bormann himself.17 As Bormann confided toScheid, who in turn passed the remarks on to the conference attendees, “Thesteps to be taken as a result of this meeting will determine the postwar futureof Germany.”18 Bormann and Scheid were perhaps a bit disingenuous, as will beseen momentarily, for the steps they undertook to put into place at theconference concerned more than just Germany, but indeed the whole postwarpolitical and economic future of Europe, and for that matter, of the Nazi Partyitself, and its goals and policies. The flight capital plans were variouslyknown as Aktion Regentröpfchen and Aktion Adlerflug, Operations Raindrop andEagle Flight, respectively.Every precaution had been taken by the SS to ensure the meeting’s completesecrecy.> Waffen SS technicians had swept the entire room, inspecting for hidden> microphones and miniature transmitters. As an additional precaution, all> suites flanking the conference suite had been held unfilled, as had the floors> above and below, out of bounds for the day. Lunch was to be served in the> conference suite by trusted Waffen SS stewards. Those present, all thirteen of> them, could be assured that the thorough precautions would safeguard them all,> even the secretary who was to take the minutes, later to be typed with a copy> sent by SS courier to Bormann.19 The precautions were entirely justified, given who was in attendance and whatwas being discussed.The roster of attendees looks like a roll call of some of Germany’s topindustrial firms:> Present were Dr. Kaspar representing Krupp, Dr. Tolle representing Röchling,> Dr. Sinceren representing Messerschmitt, Drs. Kopp, Vier, and Beerwanger> representing Bussing, Drs. Ellenmayer, Yanchew, and Koppsheim representing> various factories in Posen, Poland (Drose, Yanchew, & Co., Brown-Boveri,> Herkuleswerke, Buschwerke, and Stadtwerke); Dr. Meyer, an official of the> German Naval Ministry in Paris; and Dr. Strossner of the Ministry of Armament,> Paris.20 Scheid began the conference by informing the attendees that the battle of Francewas lost, and that all industrial plants as could be evacuated to Germany wereto be so.image [images/00015.jpg] The Hotel Maison Rouge as it is Still Seen to this day inStrasbourg, Alsace, France After some perfunctory and obligatory remarks about the necessity of defendingthe West Wall and the Reich itself, Scheid settled down to business:> From now on,he told the attendees,> German industry must take steps in preparation for a postwar commercial> campaign, with each industrial firm making new contacts and alliances with> foreign firms. This must be done individually and without attracting> suspicion. However, the party and the Third Reich will stand behind every firm> with permissive and financial support.21 To put it differently, there was to be no detailed coordination of these effortsby the Party itself, since that would attract Allied suspicion and ruin thewhole venture. As Scheid made clear by his comments, each firm was to utilizeexisting contacts and to develop new ones. But there was a catch: by pledgingParty financial support – and we already have some inkling how substantial andlarge this could be – Bormann was signaling to his corporate representativesthat he was, in effect, buying shares in their enterprises, and wantedintelligence from them, in return for that support. To drive this point home,Scheid informed the attendees that Bormann had suspended the 1933 law known asthe Treason Against the Nation act, which “mandated the death penalty forviolation of foreign exchange regulations or concealing of foreign currency.”22The implied threat was simply that Bormann, through his network of intelligencecontacts and agents, could easily “remove” any corporate executive or directorthat he wished if these implied directives were not complied with. It is atactic that, as will be seen later in this work, proved very effective.After delivering this implied threat, Scheid continued:> “The ground must now be laid on the financial level for borrowing considerable> sums from foreign countries after the war.” In other words, the war was lost, and German firms had to plan for therebuilding of Germany, all with the tacit approval of Bormann and the Party.> As an example of the kind of support that had been most useful to Germany in> the past, Dr. Scheid cited the fact that “patents for stainless steel belonged> to the Chemical Foundation, Inc., New York, and the Krupp Company of Germany,> jointly, and that of the United States Steel Corporation, Carnegie, Illinois,> American Steel & Wire, National Tube, etc., were thereby under an obligation> to work with the Krupp concern.” He also cited the Zeiss Company, the Leica> Company, and the Hamburg-Amerika Line as typical firms that had been> especially effective in protecting German interests abroad.23 Note carefully what Scheid has disclosed about the method the Party was“encouraging” German corporations to use: they were to use existing license,patent, and cartel arrangements to leverage borrowing power and influenceabroad; shades of I.G. Farben. And to the assembled corporate representatives,the lesson could hardly have been lost on them.It was to be an expansion, on a far grander scale, of the prewar machinations ofthe Dawes and Young Plans that led to the creation of I.G. Farben in the firstplace. Negotiate, penetrate, infiltrate, and cartelize all transfers oftechnology, with German and Party interests solidly at the core; these were thewatchwords of Bormann’s emerging Nazi International.Scheid then adjourned the morning session of the meeting. On his signal, theattendees were served “a real Strasbourg lunch.” On a long side table SS valetsplaced trays “of pâté de foie gras, matelote, noodles, sauerkraut, knuckles ofham, sausages, and onion tarts, along with bottles of Coq au Riesling fromnearby wineries. Brandy and cigars were also set out…”24 After this feast, Dr.Scheid departed back to Germany to spread the word – quietly – to all concernedfirms of the results and expectations of the conference, while a smallerconference reconvened in the afternoon under the chairmanship of Dr. Bosse ofthe Armaments Ministry.This afternoon session is even more revealing of Bormann’s thoughts, intentions,and grand design. In attendance at this afternoon session were only threecorporate representatives for Krupp, Hecko, and Röchling.25 Dr. Bosse then madesome interesting remarks, beginning by restating> Bormann’s belief that the war was all but lost, but that it would be continued> by Germany until certain goals to insure the economic resurgence of Germany> after the war had been achieved. He added that German industrialists must be> prepared to finance the continuation of the Nazi Party, which would be forced> to go underground…26 While all this is revealing enough, what follows is truly extraordinary andbreathtaking once its implications are carefully considered. Bosse continued byoutlining the way in which the Nazi Party and German corporations would liaise,and what their goals were to be:> “From now on, the government in Berlin,”(meaning Bormann, of course)> “will allocate large sums to industrialists so that each can establish a> secure postwar foundation in foreign countries. Existing financial reserves in> foreign countries must be placed at the disposal of the party in order that a> strong German empire can be created after defeat. It is almost immediately> required,” he continued, “that the large factories in Germany establish small> technical offices or research bureaus which will be absolutely independent and> have no connection with the factory. These bureaus will receive plans and> drawings of new weapons, as well as documents which they will need to continue> their research.

However, in cooperation with the industrialists, it is> arranging to place its less conspicuous but most important members with> various German factories as technical experts or members of its research and> designing offices.”27 All this requires some very careful unpacking, for obviously, Dr. Bosse is“speaking Nazi with the Bormann dialect.”The following points may be gleaned from this lengthy passage:> 1) Bormann basically confiscated any foreign reserves in the possession of> German corporations and placed them under the control of the Nazi Party;> 2) These funds in turn would be disbursed to corporations in aid of their> fulfillment of the goals of the conference;> 3) One primary goal was to establish “research bureaus” whose purpose,> following the I.G.

And all this implies something else, something very obvious, and verysignificant:> 7) Martin Bormann fully intended to survive the war in order to coordinate all> these activities.Also, note again the implied threat in Bosse’s remarks that “The freedom thusgiven to German industrialists further cements their relations with the party bygiving them a measure of protection in future efforts at home and overseas.”28Bormann, in other words, is playing the old organized crime game: offering“protection,” implying also the threat to use force against those veryindustrialists if they do not comply, and placing his party organization’sconsiderable international reach at their disposal if they do.With the Strasbourg Maison Rouge meeting concluded, Dr. Bosse then telephonedMartin Bormann in Berlin “over secure SS lines”29 to inform him that allattendees, not surprisingly, had agreed to the terms and conditions of theconference. Bormann’s next move, however, is revealing for what it says aboutthe nature and mechanisms he hoped to use to construct his underground FourthReich and Nazi International, for he then telephoned Georg Von Schnitzler, oneof the members of the central committee of directors of I.G. Farben.30 VonSchnitzler informed Bormman that the postwar dependency of the victorious Alliedcountries on I.G. Farben “would be so great that despite German defeat, I.G., inone way or another, could regain its position of control of the Europeanchemical business.”31 Thus, even as German troops fell back from France and theLow Countries before the Allied advance, German industrialists, at Bormann’sbehest, were busily buying major blocks of stock in French, Belgium, Dutch, andLuxemburg firms.And never one to ignore or forget a detail, Bormann saw to it that his ownpersonal records were shipped to South America – thus indicating again hisdetermination to survive the war – via Munich, thence to Spain, and from thereon freighters and U-boats ferrying SS men and other important Nazi sympathizersand treasures to South America.32 These records would ensure that his network ofNazi party corporate liaisons, intelligence agents, and financial agents, wouldrun smoothly.4. Allied Efforts to Roll Up the Bormann Flight Capital Plan Needless to say, no program of this magnitude could be kept hidden from Alliedintelligence forever; it was just too large. And Bormann, of all people, wouldhave known this. So what was he really attempting to do? The clearest picture ofBormann’s business strategy emerges from a careful though necessarily briefconsideration of Allied efforts to roll up his business fronts.As a result of the Strasbourg meeting, Bormann> in turn established 750 camouflaged corporations under the names of companies> or individuals for which he held power of attorney, and therefore over which> he had total control, as vehicles for managing the income of the Flight> Capital Program. These businesses were scattered across countries throughout> Europe, the Mid-east and Latin America. Holdings were even kept in bank> accounts in the United States of America…33 Bear those locations – Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America – in mind, forthey will show up again before this book is concluded.As a result of Bormann’s operations, the Nazi Party liaisons established withthe corporate world at the Strasbourg Maison Rouge meeting were able topenetrate 11 nations’ economies, including Germany’s, and to significantlyinfluence them in the postwar world.34 By the time of the European war’s end,Bormann’s “Nazi International” had “already ratholed $800 million plus 95 tonsof gold.”35Carter Hydrick was not unaware of Allied efforts to roll up this postwar NaziInternational, and accordingly contacted a member of the intelligence community“with whom (he) had connections and whom (he) maws told had researched thesubject matter of these Nazi business dealings.” What Hydrick found wasdisturbing:> Without mentioning (Paul) Manning or (William) Stevenson36 by name, he> asserted that what they had written about Nazi involvement in post-war> international business preparations was true and that United States government> intelligence agencies – he mentioned the CIA and its predecessor the OSS by> name – had conducted a full inquiry into the issue. He asserted that these> agencies had identified all of the relevant business dealings, had broken up> the German cartels and stripped the Nazi owners of their financial properties> and placed those instruments in the hands of the United States Alien Property> Custodian program. He “shared” this information with me in the spirit of> proving that, while certain German businessmen and high-ranking Nazis – he> mentioned Bormann specifically – tried to survive the war supported by Nazi> funds invested by clandestine means, the United State had found and uprooted> the deception. Therefore, he insisted there was no story and no need for me to> research further.37 Just how much the CIA could be trusted to investigate former Nazis and theirpostwar business dealings is a moot point, since it had, as is now well-known,concluded through Allen Dulles the notorious deal with German militaryintelligence chief General Reinhard Gehlen that turned over to nominal CIAcontrol all of Nazi Germany’s military intelligence in the Soviet Union andEastern Europe.In other words, Hydrick’s contact is really saying that the CIA in alllikelihood used Nazis to hunt other Nazis, a dubious enterprise at best, and atworst an enterprise destined to uncover only what Bormann himself probablywanted to be uncovered. In any case, Hydrick was not thrown off the trail:> But if what Paul Manning and William Stevenson had written about Nazi> international business activity was true, as he said it was, then the same> assertions that Ladislas Farago had earlier written about it are likewise> true, as is other very essential information about who they all agreed> initiated the Strasbourg Conference (i.e. Bormann, ed). The effort to vilify> Farago, therefore, was probably a smokescreen. With the knowledge my original> premise was intact and there was now an effort being put forth to fog the> truth, I put forth, more carefully, once again on this book.38 The fact that> the Nazi scheme had supposedly been put down was of no account to me; the> confirmation that the Strasbourg plan was made and initially carried out is> the cogent point for this volume. In later research I discovered, however,> that the story about the financial properties being expropriated once and for> all by the United States government, while true in form, was not true in> reality. It was yet another effort to create a fog behind which the truth> could be hidden.39 But what was that hidden truth that the U.S. government, according to Hydrick,was trying to obfuscate?Hydrick’s answer is chilling:> The first is that Martin Bormann was the central player at the Strasbourg> Conference. The second is that Bormann escaped Germany at the end of the war> and lived for many years rebuilding and controlling the economy of West> Germany and much of Europe and Latin America, and that he did all this with> the protection, support, and collusion of the United States government.40 Just why the U.S. Government would aid such a notorious Nazi as Martin Bormannin all this effort will be seen in the next chapter, but suffice it to say,Bormann had learned the lessons of “leverage” quite well.But what was all this effort to achieve? Hydrick’s answer is even more chillingstill: the efforts were designed to achieve> A quick German rebirth and eventual European economic domination by Germany…> Strategies for covertly redeploying the economy…also included a “European> economic community” that positioned Germany as the hub and “flag bearer” of a> confederated Europe that would “predominate by ‘elastic political methods’…> not with brutal force.” These elements are certainly recognizable in the> history of post-war Europe as it actually unfolded, and, in fact, Germany> continues with a high profile in the European economic model of today – which> is truly a “European Economic Community.” The evidence reflects that the> Flight Capital Program and Bormann’s partnership with I.G. Farben not only> paid off as planned, but it set the foundation for the European economy we> know today, and by extension that of the world.41 Just how true this is will be seen more completely when we examine the actualpostwar political activities of the Nazi International in the second part ofthis book.So what exactly was Bormann’s strategy?It was a corporate version of the blitzkrieg itself, for by employing massiveamounts of false fronts, dummy corporations, interlocking personnel indirectorships with no known ties to major Nazi business combines, by usingmassive amounts of corporate “fifth columns”, Bormann hoped to orchestrate avast network of corporate confusion that would take armies of finance agents andlawyers and years if not decades to sort out. And if the story of I.G. Farben’sfifty-plus year liquidation battle is any indicator, Bormann was wildlysuccessful.But this would require, as indicated, some sort of “leverage” as well, if onewas to coerce the mighty American federal government into compliance. Just whatthis leverage might have been will be explored more fully in the next chapter.The picture of Bormann the corporate manipulator that emerges from theseconsiderations, however, should give one pause, for with Bormann one is dealingwith the likes of a John D. Rockefeller or J.P. Morgan, but without their own“ethical constraints,” which were not that many to begin with. Bormann, as weshall learn in future chapters, had indeed not only positioned his NaziInternational as a major global manipulator along side of those older vestedinternational corporate and banking interests, he had to a certain degree alsosucceeded in penetrating them and using them for his own purposes.D. Conclusions As is by now evident, Allied claims to success in rolling up Bormann’s flightcapital plan leave something to be desired. Indeed, one may question whether ornot those claims are a smokescreen designed to hide something else. Just whatthat “something else” may be will be the subject of the next chapter, butsuffice it here to state that these claims were quite wide of the mark.Bormann’s Nazi International not only survived, but survived in remarkably goodorganizational and fiscal health.And as was seen in the present chapter, this organization and its flight capitalprogram had the following goals:> 1) Bormann basically confiscated any foreign reserves in the possession of> German corporations and placed them under the control of the Nazi Party;> 2) These funds in turn would be disbursed to corporations in aid of their> fulfillment of the goals of the conference;> 3) One primary goal was to establish “research bureaus” whose purpose,> following the I.G. Farben N.W. 7 model, was to gather intelligence and steal> foreign research as well as to conduct their own research;> 4) Since these technical offices were to have their own Nazi Party liaison> officer reporting directly to Bormann, it is clear that Bormann intended for> his Nazi International to conduct not only espionage but research in its own> right, under departments of German corporations only very “loosely” connected> to the Party in the surface, but deeply connected to it covertly;> 5) Each such research bureau was to be established under a cloak of other> activity, such as “investigating water resources;”> 6) The capital flight program was designed to see to it that Allied> authorities did not get the most valuable German scientists, technicians, or> knowledge, as represented in patents, all of which were to be transferred> overseas to safe havens, thus indicating that Bormann, in the light of all the> previously enumerated considerations, intended for the Party to continue an> independent line of scientific research under its own control, all the while> managing and sharing any information gained through its espionage activities> with the involved German corporations, as the Party and Bormann saw fit.All this indicates that the Neo-Nazi science fiction novels of Wilhelm Landigwere indeed “full of realities,” and that Martin Bormann fully intended tosurvive the war.The only question is, did he?As the next chapter will now argue, he not only did so, but did so in thecompany of other men whose presence in the Nazi International indicate that itsobjectives of independent Nazi control over the most advanced and arcane areasof physics research were alive and well, along with the men who coordinatedthem, secured the projects, and enforced the Nazi International’s policiesabroad.1 Cited in Jim Marrs, The Rise of the Fourth Reich, p. 112.2 See my Reich of the Black Sun, pp 46-52.3 For the full story, and an excellent recounting, of Von Manstein’scounter-counter offensive, see Paul Carrell’s Scorched Earth.4 Figures of actual Soviet and German casualties vary depending on source.5 Carter Plymton Hydrick, CriticalMass: How Nazi Germany Surrendered EnrichedUranium for the United States’ Atomic Bomb (Whitehurst and Company, 2004), pp.184-185.6 Carter Plymton Hydrick, CriticalMass: How Nazi Germany Surrendered EnrichedUranium for the United States’ Atomic Bomb (Whitehurst and Company, 2004), p.185.7 Ibid., pp. 185-186.8 Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile (Lyle Stuart, 1983), p. 399 Ibid.,,p. 44.10 Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, p. 51.11 Ibid., pp. 51-52.12 Ibid., p. 53.13 Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, p. 54.14 Ibid., p. 59.15 Ibid.16 Ibid., p. 23.17 Ibid.18 Ibid.19 Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, p. 24.20 Ibid., p. 25.21 Ibid., emphasis added.22 Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, p. 25.23 Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, p. 25.24 Ibid., p. 26.25 Ibid.26 Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, p. 26, emphasis added.27 Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, pp. 26-27, emphases added.28 Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, p. 27, emphasis added.29 Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, p. 27.30 Ibid., p. 28.31 Ibid., emphasis added.32 Ibid., p. 37.33 Hyrdick, Critical Mass, p. 192.34 Ibid.35 Ibid., p. 190, emphasis in the original.36 William Stevenson, MI-6 agent and author of the book The Bormann Brotherhood,a book that maintains the postwar Nazi International’s existence, and, moreover,its possible involvement in the JFK assassination.37 Hydrick, Critical Mass, p. 188.38 i.e., he set forth researching and writing Critical Mass.39 Hydrick, Critical Mass, p. 189.40 Ibid., emphasis added.41 Hydrick, Critical Mass, p. 194."},{"pageContent":"image [images/00016.jpg] “The Postwar Survival of theUnholy Trinity:”The Escapes of Martin Bormann,Heinrich Müller, and Hans Kammler > “Stalin told Harry Hopkins in Moscow that he believed Bormann> escaped.

In section three the case will be arguedthat the physics the Nazi International continued to investigate was preciselythe physics represented by the Bell, in fulfillment of Bormann’s directives atthe Strasbourg Hotel Maison Rouge meeting to continue areas of independent Naziresearch.A. The Escapes of Nazi Party Reichsleiter Martin Bormann andGestapo Chief Heinrich Müller1. Bormann, Müller, and the Geli Raubal Affair As noted in the extensive citation above, Martin Bormann and Heinrich Müller’sclose friendship and professional relationship goes back to the Geli Raubalaffair, and Bormann’s implied promotion of Müller to the position of head of theGestapo. Müller’s card index file system on individuals throughout Nazi Germanyand occupied Europe was extensive and thorough, as was, of course, the extensiveGestapo counterintelligence network.But the implications of this relationship are often overlooked. Bormann, who isknown to have initiated no less than four investigations of Hitler’s own familyand presumptive Jewish background without Hitler’s knowledge, most likely did sovia the Gestapo and his contact with Müller. This Bormann-Müller relationshiprepresented a vast potential for the power obtainable by blackmail and othermeans, and could, as the Geli Raubal affair suggests, include even Hitlerhimself.image [images/00017.jpg] Reichsleiter Martin Bormann with Adolf Hitler;Notably Bormann is seen here in a rare glimpse of him in hisSS Obergruppenführer’s Uniform Bormann, through his contact with his friend Heinrich Müller, could have countedon the utmost discretion from the Gestapo’s chief, since the latter owed his ownposition to Bormann’s patronage, and both were in a compromised positionvis-à-vis each other due to their roles in covering up the murder of Hitler’sone time mistress.image [images/00018.jpg] Bormann in Nazi Party Reichsleiter Uniform image [images/00019.jpg] Heinrich “Gestapo” Müller 2. The Ladislas Farrago-Paul Manning Scenario It is this Bormann-Müller nexus that forms the interpretive context by which toview the first scenario of Bormann’s escape, that presented by researchers andjournalists Ladislas Farago and Paul Manning. Both journalists made the claimthat the information in their books was based upon confidential Argentineintelligence service documents, and Farago actually reproduced some of these inhis famous book, Aftermath: Martin Bormann and the Fourth Reich. As Farago’sbook was called into question - though amply exonerated as Hydrick has alreadyindicated – we shall rely here upon the assertions contained in Paul Manning’sbook, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, reserving our detailed quotation andanalysis of the Argentine documents for a later chapter.a. Argentine Documents: Escape Via Genoa According to documents cited by Paul Manning, Martin Bormann arrived inArgentina in 1948, via the ratline established through Genoa, Italy, on afreighter disguised as a Jesuit priest.8 He arrived in Beunos Aires, Argentina,and quickly established contact with business contacts of his “NaziInternational.”9 From there, Argentine intelligence agents successfully shadowedhis movements in subsequent years throughout Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, andChile.10 Farago’s documents substantially corroborate the broad outlines of thisstory.For our purposes, it is important to note the European point of departure –Genoa, Italy – and the modus operandi of Bormann’s escape: his disguise as aJesuit priest, implying a measure of Vatican complicity, and Vatican diplomaticdocumentation, in the process. As will now be seen, this conflicts with otherversions of his escape. The question is, can these various versions bereconciled?b. Allen Dulles’ Comment to Paul Manning Paul Manning makes one highly significant comment in the Acknowledgments sectionof his book:> To Allen W. Dulles, for his encouragement and assurance that I was “on the> right track, and should keep going,” after reading my German research notes in> preparation for this book, during the afternoons we talked in his house on Q> Street in Washington, D.C.11 Dulles ought to have known, since he in part instigated the CIA’s search forBormann via his ostensible control over General Gehlen’s organization in EasternEurope, and later the CIA, of which Dulles was one time director until beingdismissed by President John F. Kennedy for his part in the Bay of Pigs fiasco;the CIA pressured Gehlen to change the story for his memoirs. Manning notes that> The U.S. C.I.A., on the other hand, theorized that the Reichsleiter had> succumbed to shellfire as he fled the bunker. Staunchly insisting that this> was so, the CIA, for some unexplained policy reason, advanced, promoted, and> encouraged this belief. They intervened, for instance, when General Reinhard> Gehlen was arranging to publish his memoirs. Gehlen had run the German> espionage network in Russia during World War II, and later, under Chancellor> Konrad Audenauer during the cold war years, had served as chief of the German> Federal Intelligence Service. The CIA obliged him to include a statement that> Martin Bormann had been a Kremlin spy, and had died in Russia in 1969! I am> told that the general complied with reluctance, but was indebted to the CIA;> during the cold war they had funded his Eastern Europe/Soviet spy operation of> 4,000 men at an annual cost to the U.S. taxpayers of around $6 million. Back> in 1953, his Bureau Gehlen had turned heaven and earth upside down for clues> to Bormann’s whereabouts in the East, reporting officially: “Bormann is not in> East Germany or in the Soviet Union. The Bureau has been unable to discover> what happened to him after he left the Reich Chancellery.” Gehlen’s> credibility in knowledgeable West German political and espionage circles was> damaged by this circumlocution. Called to Bonn to explain, he in essence> retracted his statement.> My own West German sources had told me: “The CIA was behind the General Gehlen> statement. It was a manipulation of public opinion by the CIA, immediately> obvious to anyone who knows anything about this subject. Bormann and his links> to Germany today are a hidden but a very real political issue.”12 The CIA, through Dulles’ private comment to Manning, was wanting to have it bothways: publicly insisting on the truthfulness of the standard version of historythat Bormann, along with Heinrich Müller, perished during their attempted escapefrom Berlin, and privately, through Dulles’ own comments, encouraging Manningthat he was “on the right track.”Why Dulles might have been so privately forthcoming to Manning is a matter ofsome speculation, but we can perhaps see Bormann’s own hidden hand in all thesemachinations, for clearly Bormann would not wish his survival and existenceknown, even in Germany. Hence, he would either have acquiesced in, or activelypromoted, the standard history version. Indeed, as we shall discover a littlefurther on in this chapter, there is every reason to believe that Bormanndeliberately created and planted the evidence that would lead to that veryversion of his own escape! Dulles, who knew the truth but could hardly haverevealed it without compromising or endangering himself, was perhaps quietlyencouraging Manning in the hopes that this vast postwar plot would be exposed.3. The Carter Hydrick Scenario By far the most interesting, and to my mind, most probable scenario of Bormann’sescape was that reconstructed from careful consideration of the evidence byresearcher Carter Plymton Hydrick in his crucial work Critical Mass: How NaziGermany Surrendered Enriched Uranium for the United States’ Atomic Bomb.Hydrick’s own reconstruction of the motivations for the machinations on both theAllied and Nazi sides of their respective strange activities at the end of theWar – and we shall see just how strange they really are in a moment – is evidentfrom the subtitle of his work: those activities were necessary on both sides toconceal the fact that the Nazi government was turning over a massive supply ofenriched uranium for America’s atom bomb project.This implies two corollaries: 1) The Allied project was not as far along nor asnear success as the Allied Legend version of atom bomb history maintains; and 2)the Nazi atom bomb project, conversely, was much closer to success – if indeedit was not already successful – in detonation of an atom bomb than publicstandard history would allow.13 As I demonstrate in my book Reich of the BlackSun, the Allied decision to pursue both routes to an atom bomb, i.e., a uraniumbomb and a plutonium bomb, left American stocks of fissile uranium-235 wellshort of the needed critical mass as late as December, 1944, and these stocks,according to Manhattan Project documents themselves, would not be sufficient fora workable bomb until sometime in November of 1945, months after the detonationof the Little Boy uranium bomb over Hiroshima on August 6, 1945.It is Carter Hydrick who explains why the Americans were able, in spite of thesedrawbacks, to detonate a uranium atom bomb over Hiroshima months ahead ofschedule: the German U-boat, U-234, was carrying several kilos of highlyenriched uranium-235 as part of its cargo to Japan, when suddenly, and withoutany explanation, that U-boat surrendered its precious cargo to Americanauthorities. In other words, it was German enriched uranium that made thesuccess of the Manhattan Project possible, and that meant in turn that theGerman program was much more successful than we have been led to believe. Justhow this one lone U-boat managed to run the gauntlet of Allied naval forces inthe North Sea, cross the northern Atlantic, survive numerous brushes with theRoyal Canadian Navy, only to surrender to American authorities, remains to beseen, but there is one clue, and it lies, perhaps, once again in thetechnicalities of the German surrender.a. And the Connection to the German Surrender As noted in the first chapter, no representative of the National SocialistGerman Workers’ Party was present at the surrender to the Allies and Soviets ateither the Reims, France, or Berlin surrenders. Indeed, no representative ofMartin Bormann’s Party chancery was even present at those surrenders. As alsonoted in the previous chapter, Bormann had gained control of a small number ofunregistered U-boats, so-called “black boats”, for his own use and directlyunder his own control from Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as early as 1943! In short,the Nazi Party itself had its own black submarine flotilla engaged in covertoperations, responsible directly to Martin Bormann. And since that blacksubmarine service in principle had not surrendered to the Allies at either ofthe two German surrenders via a Nazi Party representative, they were de factostill at war with the Allies.These facts will assume great importance in our examination of Hydrick’sscenario.b. Geoffrey Brooks’ Scenario: Invisible U-Boats In order to appreciate the full significance of Hydrick’s scenario, it isnecessary to view it in the light of information that is presented here courtesyof researcher Geoffrey Brooks, based upon his own examinations of Argentine andAmerica archives and newspaper accounts. As will be seen, Mr. Brooks’ generalscenario more than corroborates Hydrick’s meticulous reconstruction of the finalevents in Berlin, and the escapes of Gestapo Müller and Martin Bormann.In a series of reports shared with this author, entitled “Report on ThreeIncidents Suggestive of Invisibility of German Submarines to Visual andElectronic Detection between 27 March and 4 July 1945,” Mr. Brooks details anumber of encounters between Allied aircraft and German U-boats that do, indeed,pose something of a problem.14As Brooks notes in his report, strange incidents accompanied the U-234, carryingthe cargo of precious enriched uranium-235, as I noted in Reich of the BlackSun,15 as it ran the gauntlet of the dangerous sea passage of the Kattegatbetween Denmark and Sweden on its way to Norway on 27th of March, 1945:> From March 1945 to the end of the European War, the voyage from Kiel to Norway> was extremely dangerous for German submarines. The RAF had air supremacy over> the western Baltic and kept a tight watch over the waters. All German> submarines leaving Germany for Norway had to pass through the Kattegat between> Denmark and Sweden. The Kattegat is a narrow stretch of water easily mined and> blockaded. More than half of the submarines attempting the passage were sunk> by aircraft. Only one submarine in four made the run successfully without> receiving serious damage.> Electronic Detection Devices: Most RAF aircraft were equipped with airborne> radar enabling them to accurately fix German submarines. A few important> U-boats leaving Germany had one or other FuMB anti-radar warning devices> installed. These could detect at long range the approach of enemy aircraft and> warships emitting radar beams.16 Brooks notes that the U-234, a massive type XB cargo-carrying U-boat displacingsome 2,700 tons submerged and capable of a cruising range of some 21,000 seamiles at 10 knots – well able to handle its intended mission to Japan – departedKiel on March 26, 1945, carrying “eleven scientific-military passengers” whichincluded “two Japanese and six Wehrmacht officers,” all of whom outranked theU-boat skipper, Kapitänleutnant Johann Fehler.17 As I noted in my book Reich ofthe Black Sun, this cargo also included some 80 gold-lined cylinders full ofenriched uranium-235, the plans and a complete model of the Messerschmitt 262jet fighter, plus German infrared proximity fuses and their inventor, Dr. HeinzSchlicke, fuses that in all likelihood made America’s successful detonation ofits plutonium bomb later that year successful.18Then, on March 27, 1945, at 1500 hours (i.e., 3:00 PM central European Time),the U-234 recorded the first of many strange incidents on her strange voyage.According to Brooks:> (1)…three enemy aircraft were sighted ahead and the flak guns were manned. As> the range decreased from 5000 yards, Oberfunkmeister Wolfgang Hirschfeld> relayed the distances to the bridge. At 3000 yards, Fehler gave the order to> open fire. Hirschfeld was in the radio room and heard the commander give this> order. The flak guns did not respond. Hirschfeld ran to the bridge and saw> Fehler pleading with the gun crew to open fire, but they ignored him. The> enemy aircraft now flew over the string of four submarines and were apparently> unaware of their presence.> (2) At midnight on 27 March 1945 off Frederikshavn(sic) the four U-boats> passed a convoy of four steamers, with torpedo boats as escort, heading> southwards for Germany. RAF aircraft fired flare clusters to bathe the> seascape in a pale light then attacked the steamers. They appeared to overlook> the four U-boats, the priority target.> (3) A half hour later the U-234 anti-radar showed that the Kattegat was now> swarming with enemy aircraft. A machine was identified approaching at low> altitude from the west, barely skimming the surface. At 3300 yards the> aircraft veered away. Thirty minutes later another bomber came in from the> same direction and again disengaged at 3300 yards. “The game went on all> night,” Wilfgang Hirschfeld wrote, “it was repeated three times. It could not> have been coincidence.” (on the) new morning all four U-boats arrived> undamaged at Oslo Fjord.19 Mr. Brooks is correct: under normal Allied operating procedures, the U-boats inthe small submarine convoy which included the U-234 would have been attacked byAllied aircraft. On no less than three occasions, however, the aircraft camewithin easy visual range of the convoy, illuminated it with flares, and yet,inexplicably, did not attack. Why?Mr. Brooks’ own answer is illuminative of one possibility:> (i) Numerous details regarding this voyage remain top secret. An apparently> innocuous fact which remains secret is the data respecting the fuel aboard> U-234: how much was loaded, how much expended. In both the other cases to be> mentioned, the boats loaded inexplicably up to 35% short “to maintain> stability.”> (ii) Why did the flak crew disobey the commander? Either the flak gunners were> affected mentally while inside the energy field, or perhaps (the U-boat> captain) had forgotten that a more senior officer had full authority over the> “special equipment”?> (iii) On two occasions – the first encounter and in the flare-light at night –> the submarines appear to have been invisible to the eye and enemy radar.> (iv) The last contacts appear to suggest that the submarines were now being> seen on radar – perhaps the energy field was weakening – but as they entered> the field the aircraft functions were jeopardized in some manner - “if your> aircraft starts to run rough for no apparent reason, pull away.”20 It is clear what Brooks is implying: the U-234 and its companion U-boats mayhave been outfitted with some special radar-cloaking electronic equipment,devices which may have rendered them optically and radar invisible to Alliedaircraft. As a result of the strong electromagnetic field these devicesundoubtedly set up, the German flak crew on the deck of the U-boats – rememberthey were running on the surface – may have been affected by this field in somestrange way. Or, as Brooks also suggests, they may have been under orders not tofire from officers senior to the U-234’s commander, Captain Fehler. The presenceof such equipment on these U-boats, Brooks implies, may account for their notloading the full complement of fuel, for they were unable to do so with theheavy electrical equipment on board.While all this may sound far-fetched, it is indeed not beyond the bounds ofpossibility. As I demonstrated in my previous book, Secrets of the UnifiedField: The Philadelphia Experiment, the Nazi Bell, and the Discarded Theory, oneand the same physics underlay the U.S. Navy’s infamous Philadelphia Experiment,an experiment that indeed purportedly made a U.S. destroyer escort opticallyinvisible, and the Nazi Bell. If the Germans had configured radar equipment tobe beamed on the Bell while it was in operation, they may indeed have discoveredsome profound radar cloaking properties being produced by the device. Whilethere is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the Nazis did such a procedure,or that they performed any such experiments, it is known that they did conducttop secret radar tests on their Radar Absorbent Material (RAM), during the sametime period of the war,21 and additionally, the German Kriegsmarine itself wasrepresented in the Bell project in the form of the German “Admiral Rhein” in theBell project’s parent organization!22 As I also pointed out, the legend of thePhiladelphia Experiment does include allegations of strange mental andphysiological behaviors being induced in the people exposed to the fieldallegedly established during the experiment.23Brooks records yet another peculiar incident involving a U-boat and its strange“invisibility” to Allied radar-equipped aircraft. The famous case of the U-977,one of the U-boats that surrendered to Argentina long months after the war inEurope had ended, began her voyage in a similar fashion to the U-234:> In the third week of April 1945, U-977 sailed for Norway in a convoy of three> submarines. At Frederikshavn provisions were loaded. Combined with the assumed> heavy load already aboard, the boat was now overloaded, and the Chief Engineer> warned that it would be difficult if not impossible to maintain the trim when> diving. OKM (OberKommando der Kriegsmarine, German Naval High Command, ed.)> had ordered that the voyage should be accomplished at schnorchel depth, but> Schäffer decided to proceed on the surface and alone because his crew was> inadequately trained on the schnorchel.> After leaving Frederikshavn, an enemy night attack came when U-977 was> navigating in the heavily mined shallows and could not dive. The anti-radar> gave warning of enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft were therefore equipped> with radar. Schäffer counted twelve, approaching fast. He heard the noise of> their engines. The aircraft circled interminably, apparently unable to get a> proper fix on the surfaced submarine. They would attack with rockets which> sliced through the hull of a submarine and thus sink it when the time came. No> attack came, and after a few hours when U-977 left the shallows, Schäffer> dived. The anti-radar showed that the aircraft followed him, but did not> attack.24 As Brooks notes elsewhere in this part of his report, the U-977 was an oldertype VII U-boat, and its intended mission in 1945 was to sneak into Southamptonand sink Allied shipping, a suicide mission for a type VII(especially when manyof the much newer Type XXIII electro-boats with their novel, and quiet,propulsion systems were available for this type of attack) unless the U-977 wasequipped with special experimental cloaking equipment.But might there have been a different kind of “invisibility” operating in theselate war encounters between German U-boats and Allied aircraft?c. Hydrick on the Surrender of German A-Bomb Secrets andEnriched Uranium-235: “Invisible” U-Boats Reconsidered (1) The Official Versions, and Their Problems Indeed, there might have been, and the name of that special kind of invisibilitywas called “Martin Bormann,” and an implied and highly covert, above-top-secretdeal that he might have negotiated with the Americans as the European War drewnear its end. And it was, as we shall see in a few pages, a deal that had tohave “teeth” in order to persuade the Americans of its bona fides, enough teethto make sure they lived up to their part of the bargain.And with this we are confronted with the escapes of Martin Bormann and HeinrichMüller, and the deal, seen in the total context of Bormann’s strategicevacuation plan, that they brokered and that their escapes signify. Hydrick’s isthe most meticulous reconstruction of this probable escape scenario, and of whatits real, and continuing, implications are.The story begins, once again, with the U-boat U-234, and its precious cargo ofinfrared proximity fuses and enriched uranium-235. The story of Bormann’s rolein this voyage, and of his probable escape from Berlin, is not without its owndifficulties. As Carter Hydrick himself observes, it is when pondering Bormann’s“death” or “escape” itself that the whole hornet’s nest of problems reallybegins to buzz:> For over fifty years a debate has raged about whether Martin Bormann escaped> from Berlin in the spring of 1945, whether he was killed in a fiery explosion> on Weidendammer Bridge in that city,25 or whether he mysteriously died a few> hours later at the Lehrter Station Bridge a few miles away.26 Over that> half-century, so many accounts of his last days in Berlin have been generated,> fabricated, amended, modified, denied, rebutted, investigated, expunged,> reborn, reshaped and abridged that nothing is certain but a black mist of> confusion and suspicion that hangs over the whole affair like a thick pall.> Indeed, the truth may never be known. Not just because the evidence supporting> any outcome is inconclusive, but because there seems to be few participants> who were or are objective on the matter, and therefore the testimony and> evidence they provide must, for prudence, be viewed with varying degrees of> skepticism. What is known, despite the bleak picture that is always painted of> these events, is that 90 percent of those who were in the bunker at the end of> the war survived.27 Just how much of this thick black pall of confusion was of Bormann’s andMüller’s own making remains to be seen, but whatever the standard versions ofhistory that quickly began to be pushed by the Allies publicly, it issignificant that the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunals weren’t buying, for theytried, convicted, and sentenced Bormann to death in absentia, for good measure,just in case he should resurrect himself from the Weidendammer Bridge or theLehrter Station – or wherever – and return in an unbidden and unwelcome secondcoming.For Hydrick, however, the events of Bormann’s last days in Berlin and the voyageof the U-234 with its precious cargo are intimately connected, and to show how,Hydrick first discloses the complex methodology that informs his ownreconstruction of Bormann’s and Müller’s escapes:> The evidence, in fact, is significant in support of both theories (of his> death and of his escape), and, despite claims of certainty by both camps, a> detailed study of all the data available tends to muddy the already shadowy> history beyond ever finding certain resolution. Indeed, there is strong> evidence the waters were muddied intentionally by those who merely had to make> his fate questionable, in order to win their objective of invalidating any> reference to Martin Bormann in post-war history. But by filtering all of the> available information through two criteria, one may possibly gain, if not a> crystal clear understanding of the outcome of events, at least the most> probable outcome of Bormann’s last days in Berlin.28 That probable outcome according to Hydrick is clearly that Martin Bormannescaped to safety, most likely in the company of his friend and fellow bunkerescapee, Heinrich “Gestapo” Müller.29The two criteria are clearly spelled out by Hydrick. One of them looks> At dissociated stories surrounding these events and see(s) what parallels> might verify each other to validate details. The more numerous and specific> the evidentiary pieces paralleled, the more probable that they are true –> assuming they are not totally invalidated by known facts.> The other (criterion) is that of judiciously weighing the evidence against who> presented and/or supports it – and why – in an effort to identify and properly> interpret political and other influences that may have colored the information> presented. By combining these two methods of analyzing the information, a more> coherent and believable – in fact, this author believes, probable, though> disturbing – case for Bormann’s survival is formed, rather than the accepted> scenario of his death. Let it be noted here, however, that this author does> not believe this evidence is conclusive. I believe only that the evidence is> significant and superior for Bormann’s survival over the evidence of his> demise in Berlin. And that evidence shows U-234 was related to his escape…30 Needless to say, Hydrick’s evidence, when combined with other evidence of Nazisurvival in general, as well as Bormann’s survival in particular, to bepresented in this book, in my opinion argues quite strongly, though again notconclusively, that Bormann and two other top Nazis essential to the postwarprogram of his Nazi International did in fact survive the war: Heinrich“Gestapo” Müller and SS General and secret weapons projects head Hans Kammler.The standard version of Bormann’s and Müller’s escape from the Führerbunkerbeneath the Reichschancellory building is by now familiar territory to mostWorld War Two researchers. Sometime during the late hours of May 1, 1945, afterAdolf and Eva Hitler’s alleged suicides, the remaining bunker party dividedthemselves into small groups and snuck out of the bunker during the night, undera constant hail of Russian artillery and small arms fire. “Each group wasresponsible to find its own way to safety.”31> In one of these pathetic patrols reportedly stalked the potbellied,> short-legged, bull-necked profile of Marti Bormann, commander of the Nazi> party and Hitler’s closest confidant. According to the provided scenario, the> small group slowly picked its way through the bombshells, bodies and debris> littering the streets to a local subway station, where, once again, it slipped> under cover of earth. Walking the rails in the dark subway tunnels, the silent> group made its way north, where it again surfaced to find means to cross the> Spree River.> At Weidendammer Bridge the group ran into heavy fighting between German tanks> and Russian forces. One story asserts that Bormann tried to cross the bridge> under cover of a German tank navigating the narrow span. The tank was shelled> by a bazooka and exploded in a violent burst of flame, killing Bormann> according to “eyewitness” Erich Kempka, Hitler’s chauffer and a member of the> Fuehrer Bunker escape party.32 At least four other “trusted Hitler insiders” also reported seeing the sameevent, with the same results.33But then the story started, almost immediately, to spin out of control, as newwitnesses surfaced with new and in most cases contradictory details. One ofthem, a Spanish SS volunteer and avowed Nazi, was fighting as part of a small SSdetachment near the bridge. He saw the rocket shell from the bazooka hit theGerman tank, and explode. The Spaniard, Juan Roca-Pinar, then boarded the tank,opened the hatch (apparently the German crew had forgotten to bolt it frominside, an unlikely event in a combat situation!), and discovered Bormann deadinside the tank.34 Roca-Pinar’s story was corroborated by a Harald Mengerhausen,a member of Hitler’s bodyguard, who likewise stated that Bormann had been in atank, but that Bormann was not killed in the blast because he had been in adifferent tank altogether!35From here, the standard history quickly deteriorates. For example, Artur Axmann,leader of the Hitler Youth, “Claimed to have run into Bormann after theWeidendammer Bridge catastrophe and asserted that Bormann was alive, well andcompletely unharmed.”36 Axmann and Bormann, according to this version, then madecommon cause in their escape for a brief moment, before they separated “tosearch for their own passages to freedom.”37And then, things get even stranger:> Axmann headed west, but, finding the way blocked, subsequently retraced his> steps and claims to have again come across Bormann and Dr. Stumpfegger, one of> Hitler’s physicians, on a railroad trestle at the Lehrter Fairgrounds train> station. Bormann and Stumpfegger were lying side by side on the bridge and> appeared to be dead. Axmann leaned close to Bormann’s body to check for> breathing and could discern none. He later would not swear with certainty,> however, that the Reichsleiter had expired.> Indeed their “deaths,” if they were dead, were strange. According to Axmann,> neither corpse showed any indication of being wounded or injured or showed any> signs of violence – quite out of line with the reports from Weidendammer> Bridge, even if Bormann had survived the tank blast, and further mystifying> given their deaths having taken place during a heavy battle. They lay calmly> next to each other in peaceful repose, their arms resting casually at their> sides, as if they had laid down on their own, or somebody had laid them there.> Axmann wondered if they had been poisoned or poisoned themselves.38 Hydrick’s conclusion about the two official standard versions is worth citing:> And so the semi-official version of Bormann’s demise is dubiously documented> in a melee of misaligned explanations and seemingly unexplainable> inconsistencies. The picture would get further obscured. A rash of post-war> Bormann sightings across Europe began to be reported. He was in Sweden, Italy,> Spain, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, even as far away as Argentina.39 But why insist that the documentation itself is dubious, as Hydrick does?For a very simple reason: all of the eyewitness reports of Bormann’s demise comefrom Nazis themselves. And that fact raises the even more problematic questionof how a story based on the eyewitness testimony of Nazis became in effect thestandard view of history for the victorious Allied Powers. That question will,upon reflection, bear obvious implications for the similar question of the storyof Hitler’s suicide, for once again, all of the eyewitness testimony comesprecisely from Nazis.In any case, the official versions of Bormann’s feat of dying twice, once at theWeidendammer Bridge (under two very different conditions), and again at theLehrter Fairground railway station, were soon further compounded by so-calledforensic evidence literally unearthed decades after the event. Reports sooncirculated that the Russians had found Bormann’s body exactly where Axmann saidit would be and quickly identified it as Bormann’s because it containedBormann’s journal, conveniently found in the dead gentleman’s now much decayedovercoat.40 Joy and relief were quickly dispelled, however, when it wasdisclosed that the Soviets had “quickly surmised that the diary had been placedin the overcoat to lead investigators off of Bormann’s trail.”41To make matters worse, in late 1972,> Just as two separate articles by Ladislas Farago and Paul Manning began being> published that convincingly argued that Bormann had escaped Berlin, a> construction crew “accidentally,” and under suspicious conditions, unearthed> two skulls and some bones 20 yards from the location previously dug up by the> official Bormann search party…> The skulls were examined to see if one was Bormann’s but there was a problem:> no records of Bormann’s dentistry or any other identification marks existed> that could be compared against the skeletal remains. The only record available> was a sketch drawn from memory by Bormann’s by-then-deceased dentist, Dr. Hugo> Blaschke, who drew the sketches during interrogation for the Nuremberg> tgrials. The accuracy of the chart was attested to by Fritz Echtmann, a dental> technician who had never actually seen Bormann’s teeth, but who had built a> dental bridge for a patient he “assumed” was Bormann, based on data given by> Dr. Blaschke. Using this data, the pathologists in the case compared the> sketch with the unearthed skulls and proclaimed a match with one.42 There was just one problem: “the skull may not have been Bormann’s” because theSoviets had, in fact, re-buried the Bormann corpse they had found in a differentlocation.43As if that were not enough, the skull conveniently discovered by accident wentthrough no less than four different iterations, “each succeeding craniumbecoming more and more aligned with the dental sketch of Dr. Blaschke assucceeding complaints came in about obvious inconsistencies.”44 But then thefinal word came in May of 1997, when DNA tests were conducted on the skull and“a positive identification announced in May 1998.”45Except that the specific DNA results were never released.And also, except for the fact that the provenance of the skull was notimpeccable.46And also, except for the fact that the disposition of those who controlled theskull is not established beyond any doubt as being completely neutral.47And also, because the skull’s whereabouts for almost two decades was unknown,from its disappearance in Soviet hands after its reburial, to its rediscoverysome yards away from where it should have been.48All of this, as Hydrick rightly quips, “combine to cast more than reasonabledoubt, not so much upon the authenticity of the DNA tests, which, asdemonstrated, could have gone either way, but upon whether they have anyrelevance in the matter at all,”49 for it would be a simple matter for the skullto have been planted long after Bormann’s demise, whether in 1945 or later, andgiven the skull’s unknown location for twenty years, it is a distinctpossibility.(2) Obfuscating the Data and Confusing the Trails: Doubles So what of the dental records? As Hydrick observes, it would not have been adifficult matter to find one or two (or three) Bormann look-alikes,Doppelgängers or body doubles, alter those individual’s dental records, and havethem all escaping at convenient times from the Bunker in order to deliberatelyconfuse the trail. And as for DNA evidence, that too, may be a bitproblematical, as Hydrick suggests:> One last possibility is worth mentioning, however, regarding DNA testing of> the skull. If the Soviet report is wrong and the skull tested for DNA was> actually that of the person buried in Lehrter Station with Dr. Stumpfegger, it> may well have been that of Bormann’s double. (Heinrich “Gestapo”) Mueller had> successfully found a double for Hitler in one of the Fuehrer’s distant> cousins. Might he have done the same for Bormann when developing Bormann’s> double? James O’Donnell, author of The Bunker, noticed on a personal visit to> Bormann’s hometown that a large percentage of the people there looked like> Bormann, and were possible relations. If the body was that of a Bormann> relative, DNA tests quite possibly would have shown similar markers with the> DNA provided by another relative, without the skull being that of Martin> Bormann.50 When all is said and done, the DNA testing has done little to advance either thescenario of Bormann’s death-while-escaping, or that of his survival. It hasmerely highlighted in a major way the lengths to which Bormann and Müllerthemselves possibly went to obfuscate the data and confuse the trails.It might be argued that this speculation that the Nazis deliberately deployedBormann relatives to confuse such future genetic identification of any dead“body doubles” is anarchronistic, since the DNA helix itself would not beofficially discovered until two years after the end of the war, in 1947, byWatson and Crick. However, the Nazis had done enough genetic research of theirown, I believe, that the case can be argued that they would have known the codewould inevitably be cracked, and usable as a means of identification with enoughtechnological development.In any case, Hydrick’s mention of O’Donnell’s visit to Bormann’s hometown, andhis observation that the males of the town, distant Bormann relatives, alllooked like the infamous Reichsleiter himself, throws open yet anotherpossibility that Hydrick does not mention, but which thoroughness requires bestated. Bormann was indeed sighted all over Europe and Latin America in theyears immediately following the war, and for some time afterward. It would notbe beyond the bounds of possibility – and assumes great significance if indeedBormann did in fact survive – for Müller to have employed several Bormannlook-alikes to create several false trails, serving to obfuscate the pictureeven more, while simultaneously cloaking the Reichsleiter’s real movements andwhereabouts. This possibility will assume some significance as the variousescape scenarios are analyzed later in this chapter.(3) The Hydrick Scenario(a) The Movements of Martin Bormann and Heinrich Müller So, how did Martin Bormann escape?As Hydrick observes, Stalin believed, on the basis of Soviet intelligencereports, that Borman flew out of Berlin close to dawn on April 30, 1945.According to these reports, three men and a woman were flown out on the smallplane, supposedly flying in the direction of Hamburg. The Soviets also noted thedeparture of a “large U-boat” from Hamburg before the British army arrived tocapture the city.51 Stalin informed Harry Hopkins in Moscow that he believedthat Bormann was one of those who escaped on that fleeing U-boat.52 Moreimportantly, “Stalin insisted until his death that his was the correct accountof Martin Bormann’s fate.”53Hydrick then asks, and answers, three all-important questions:> Why would Stalin make such a claim? What did he stand to gain if it was a lie?> What did he stand to loose if it was true? And if it were true, why would the> United States discount it out of hand?… If Stalin was not telling the truth,> why did he include such unique, improbable and seemingly contestable details> as the fact that the airplane carried four people when the only two airplanes> capable of using the ad hoc runway – the Fieseler Storch and the Arado – were> designed, respectively, to carry three and two people. Depending on which> witness tells the story, both the Fieseler Storch and the Arado are said to> have been the escape airplane. Why did Stalin include a woman in the escape> party when it was almost inconceivable that a woman would be so important as> to justify overloading the plane on this desperate and dangerous mission? And> why would Stalin assert the escape was continued from Hamburg on a “large”> U-boat? The chances seemed slim that such an escape as Stalin described was> ever made.54 However, a number of allegations in Stalin’s version are indeed oddlycorroborated by the facts themselves.In the first instance, it is known that a makeshift runway was indeed operatingfrom the Tiergarten during the last days of the war in order to shuttleimportant visitors and other items into, or out of, the Führerbunker in thefinal days of the war. As Hydrick observes, however, at the time of Stalin’salleged remark to Harry Hopkins, that fact was not well-known.55Secondly, as is now well-known from the standard versions of Hitler’s suicide,the famous German test pilot Hanna Reitsch had flown a Fieseler Storch bearingLuftwaffe General Robert Ritter Von Greim to Berlin only a few days prior toApril 30th, an event memorialized, in fact, in the famous movie Hilter: the LastTen Days, starring Sir Alec Guinness as an increasingly derranged Hitler.According to the standard historical line, followed closely in the movie, Hitlerhad ordered Von Greim and Reitsch to make the dangerous flight simply so thatHitler could appoint Von Greim to be the chief of the now nearly non-existentLuftwaffe after Hitler ordered Göring deposed from all positions for attemptingto take control of the government.56According to Reitsch herself, she and Von Greim flew out of Berlin at dawn onApril 30th, 1945 – the same date and time as Stalin’s version of Bormann’sescape by airplane from Berlin, and made their way to Admiral Karl Dönitz’sheadquarters at Plön. Reitsch gave as their reason for this flight plan as“fulfilling an order from the Fuehrer to deliver an important package, and thedesire to wish the Admiral a found farewell.”57 Obviously, the idea of bidding“fond farewells” to the Admiral is laughable on the face of it, but the ideathat Reitsch and Von Greim were fulfilling an order of Hitler to convey animportant package, “especially if the package was Martin Bormann with Hitler’slast will and testament,” which documented Hitler’s decision to turn overpolitical and military command of the Reich to Dönitz, does ring true.58 “Thetraditional history,” notes Hydrick,> Documents well Bormann’s intense efforts to make his way to Admiral Doenitz> during this time. Bormann had told his family they would be escaping on a> U-boat to Japan, and some of Borman’s closest associates, including Gauleiter> Erich Koch and others, expected to escape by U-boat as well, with Bormann’s> help. So strong was Bormann’s effort to reach Doenitz that by 3:30 the morning> of 30 April, Bormann had convinced Hitler to issue an order to his pilot, Hans> Baur, to fly Bormann to Doenitz.59 So Bormann was indeed attempting to escape Berlin, not on foot as recounted inthe standard histories, but by aircraft from the makeshift runway at theTiergarten.But there is another escape from Berlin by air that should be noted. As alreadyobserved, in Stalin’s version, three men and a woman are on the flight carryingBormann out of Berlin. If, then, Bormann escaped on the flight with Reitsch andVon Greim in the three-passenger Fieseler Storch, then this would only accountfor two men – Bormann and General Von Greim - and Hanna Reitsch herself,piloting the craft. If there was a fourth person, the identity remains unknown,though Gestapo Müller is a distinct possibility.60 This is where the otherescape flight from Berlin comes in.According to alleged interrogation records of Gestapo Müller from 1949 – fouryears after the Gestapo chief’s “official” death while escaping Berlin – Müllerdescribed his flight from Berlin on April 29th in a Fieseler Storch piloted byone pilot.61This flight does strongly suggest that Müller was the fourth party on theReitsch flight for the following reasons:> First, If Bormann and Mueller did escape secretly in company of Reitsch and> Greim, it would seem that as joint conspirators and protectors of the post-war> Nazi cause they all would have agreed to eliminate each other’s escapes when> reciting their own cover stories. For this reason, Reitsch would not have> identified Bormann or Mueller as having been on the flight she piloted to> Doenitz. Under the same agreement, Mueller would not have identified any of> his flying mates either; therefore he reported he flew alone.62 In other words, to make the stories of Müller’s and Bormann’s escape by ground –the standard version of history – seem plausible, agreed-upon cover stories hadto be concocted before the flight itself occurred, and this could only be doneby Reitsch’s and Von Greim’s physical presence in Berlin in the bunker, withBormann and Müller briefing the other two on the plan.But what has all this to do with the “large U-boat,” the U-234, and its cargo ofinfrared proximity fuses and enriched uranium?As Hydrick points out, the U-234 was the only boat of its size “left in theAtlantic theater,”63 probably making it the boat in question in Stalin’saccount. But there is more tying Bormann and Müller to the ship, for there weretwo communications from the Führerbunker directly regarding the departure of theU-234 as will be seen in a moment. Moreover,> Captain Fehler appears to have taken U-234 on a convoluted voyage, with each> successive twist and turn apparently intended, at first, to keep U-234 within> a few days’ proximity to Germany, and later, to hide the U-boat’s movements> and activities as it tried to surrender only to the United States.64 So exactly what was happening to the U-234 from the time of her departure fromKiel on March 25, 1945,65 and the flight of Hanna Reitsch, General Von Greim,and in all likelihood Martin Bormann and Heinrich Müller?Captain Fehler ran the U-boat on the surface out of Kiel, and once in the openwaters of the Baltic, it was joined by two more U-boats for the first leg of thejourney to Norway.66 Waiting until the cover of darkness, U-234 and her escortsbegan the first part of their journey after being joined by three more typeXXIII electro-boats. Once through the narrow straits between Sweden and Denmark,the two original U-boat escorts dropped off and the U-234 and the three typeXXIII’s continued under the cover of darkness through the Kattegat, hugging thecoast of Sweden and doing about 10 knots.67 It was here that the U-boats hadtheir strange encounter with the Allied aircraft68 observed by Geoffrey Brooksearlier in this chapter.But now Hydrick offers a different account of the small flotilla’s apparentinvisibility to the Allied aircraft:> The enemy air patrol may have been on a dedicated mission elsewhere and simply> was not interested in the mini-armada. Or the aircraft may have been ordered> only to reconnoiter the U-boats but not attack, an odd but plausible scenario> given ensuing events. Whatever the case, the U-boats continued their course> toward Norway.69 To put it differently, Bormann, who had offered the Americans the enricheduranium-235 and priceless infrared proximity fuses aboard the U-boat, in returnfor his own escape, had also given them highly secret information concerning theU-boat’s course. And the Americans, for their part, informed their BritishAllies to have their aircraft monitor the U-boat’s course, but not to attack,most likely concealing from them the real reason for the strange orders.Hydrick also recounts the similar near approach of the Allied aircraft on noless than three occasions, and the similar breaking of attack, as mentionedpreviously by Brooks.70> That no effort was made to sink U-234, but several attacks appear, in fact, to> have been suppressed, suggests that, instead of wanting the vessel and its> contents and passengers destroyed, the U-boat was being monitored and its> passage protected at a high level within Allied command, for some unknown> purpose. Obviously, if U-234’s progress was being tracked and protected by the> Allies, probably the crews of the attacking aircraft would not have known it.> But if there were those in higher Allied circles who knew of and expected to> obtain U-234’s uranium cargo, certainly they would have kept a close eye on> its whereabouts and the conditions under which it was traveling – and had> channels to the proper authorities necessary to divert disaster if required.71 The air attacks thus averted, the U-234 and her escorts arrived in Oslo fjordshortly before sunrise on the 27th of March, 1945.72There the U-boat underwent minor repairs for the lengthy journey to Japan, whileits radio operator Wolfgang Hirschfeld journeyed each day to retrieve radiomessages for the U-234 from the U-boat radio operations center at Kristiansand.During one of these visits shortly after the U-boat’s arrival in Norway,Hirschfeld claimed to have received a short communication:> U-234. Only sail on the orders of the highest level. Fuehrer HQ.73 In short, the Führerbunker had now taken direct control of the U-234 fromAdmiral Dönitz. As will be seen in a moment, this did not sit too well with theGrand Admiral.At this point, the story of the U-234 becomes downright bizarre by any standardline of explanation, for later that same afternoon, Hirschfeld was summoned tothe flotilla headquarters once again to explain the latest radio message it hadreceived for the U-234. Hirschfeld was accompanied by the Second Watch OfficerKarl Pfaff, who was in charge of loading the U-boat, and thus who would haveknown something about its treasure-cargo.The message they were summoned to explain stated:> To head radio chief Hirschfeld on U-234, for your last trip, much luck and> healthy return home. Your Bubbi.74 The flotilla commander demanded Hirschfeld explain who “Bubbi” was, andHirschfeld’s explanations leave a lot to be desired, for he told the commanderthat it was the nickname of the radio operator of the U-boat base in Lorient,France, which had long since fallen to the Allies.75 Clearly, Hirschfeld wasprotecting highly privileged and secret information.As Hydrick observes, it appears that a highly secret line of communications hadbeen established prior to the boat’s departure from Kiel, directly between theU-boat captain and its radio operator, Hirschfeld, and Berlin itself, bypassingGrand Admiral Dönitz completely, and using frequencies “which U-234 wasincapable of receiving,” explaining the necessity for Hirschfeld to journey toKristiansand to pick up messages for the ship while it was undergoing repairs.Or, perhaps, the system had been established to avoid disclosing theconfidential messages to normal U-boat command, i.e., Grand Admiral Dönitz.76In any case, later in the day Hirschfeld was again recalled to the radio centerto retrieve yet another message, this one directly from Dönitz himself: “U-234is to leave under my command only. After you have made your calculations, leave.BdU.”77 As Hydrick observes, the designation BdU was Dönitz’s personal commanddesignation. “Doenitz’s message makes clear,” notes Hydrick, “that a strugglefor control of U-234 was taking place, for, as the supreme commander of theGerman Navy, why else would the Admiral have to remind one of his captains todepart only on his command?”78 It is even likely, according to Hydrick, that thecontents of the mysterious “Bubbi” message was relayed by the local flotillacommander to Dönitz, making him aware of a parallel chain of command thatsomeone in Berlin was attempting to establish over the U-boat.79All this sets subsequent political events into a very different perspective:> Ultimately history records that Martin Bormann, from the besieged bunker in> Berlin, spent considerable attention on negotiations with Doenitz in order to> effect his escape from the strangling city. And it records that Grand Admiral> Karl Doenitz, without political experience or, indeed, any political> following, eventually, and very unexpectedly, replaced Hermann Goering – whom> Bormann had succeeded in bringing down as Hitler’s successor – when Bormann> notified Doenitz that the Admiral was to succeed Hitler as Chancellor of the> Third Reich.80 Given the U-234’s cargo of enriched uranium-235, highly suspicious Allied airattacks on the U-boat that never materialized, and Dönitz’s own succession toHitler, communicated to him by Bormann himself, we can now see the hiddenpolitics being played out as Bormann attempted to commandeer the U-boat for hisescape, while ensuring its cargo reached its real intended destination: notJapan, but the United States. Someone at high levels on both the American andNazi sides of the war, was extremely interested in the fate of the U-boat.These considerations present a further possible speculation that “Bubbi” was infact Bormann himself, who would have certainly had access to the bunker’soutside radio communications. Indeed, Bormann not only had access, butcontrolled those communications. Thus the “Bubbi message” to Hirschfeld for a“healthy return” was in all probability a coded message for the U-boat to returnto Germany to pick up some new passengers.The movements of the U-234 after it received Dönitz’s message reasserting theAdmiral’s direct control over it, and his orders to depart as soon as it wasable, give credence to this scenario, for Fehler received the radio message onApril 14th, and the submarine did not depart Norway until April 16th, the verysame day as Russian artillery came within range of Berlin and began thebombardment of the city.81 Hydrick maintains the possibility that the news ofthe Russian bombardment itself was a prearranged signal for the U-boat to setsail and await further orders.82We have already noted Hydrick’s scenario that Bormann and Müller escaped on theflight of Hanna Reitsch and General Von Greim from Berlin on April 29 (if onefollows the early date) or April 30 (if one follows the later date). This wouldhave allowed Bormann and the Gestapo chief a one to two day head start fromothers remaining behind with Hitler in the bunker, and waiting for the momentthat they too could make their escape. More importantly, as Hydrick states, itwould allow time to leave suitable false trails and concoct alibis “that wouldresolve their fates for the outside world and eliminate post-warinvestigations.”83 Having placed suitable body doubles at the prearranged spotsfor their “deaths” and rehearsing the eyewitnesses – Nazis all - in theirconfusing and contradictory stories, Bormann and Müller flew northward tosafety.84Once in Hamburg, what happened? Hydrick summarizes the remaining parts of hisscenario this way:> If the above is true, the most probable scenario is that upon disembarking> Hamburg, the U-boat took Bormann, under protection of the watchful eyes of the> Allies – remember the planes that did not attack – through the English Channel> to a prearranged rendezvous point in the Bay of Biscay. There he boarded> another vessel and was ferried to the north coast of Spain, where OSS reports> say he stayed with one “Leon DeGrelle.” In Spain, Bormann quietly completed> his European business affairs behind the scenes and under the protection of> Spain and, by secret extension, the United States’ watchful eyes, as he> consolidated the underground economy that would soon reinvent Europe.85 But there is no need for Hydrick to have invoked the complicit participation ofthe U.S.A. in this scheme. Bormann could have negotiated the surrender of theU-234 – its precious enriched uranium-235 and infrared proximity fuses – to theUnited States without disclosing his and Müller’s intended presence on theU-boat, and thus, cloaking themselves behind a wall of protection that they knewwould be extended to the U-boat – witness the Allied “air attacks” that neveroccurred once again – have escaped via the U-234 wholly unbeknownst to theAmericans themselves. As will be seen from the evidence presented in part three,this scenario does have a certain degree of evidence in its favor.There is other circumstantial evidence to suggest Müller and Bormann escaped.For example, Hydrick mentions the case when Heinrich Müller’s alleged grave inBerlin – conscientiously decorated by family members for years after his death –was ordered exhumed by the district attorney for West Berlin. What was foundwere the remains of three different men, none of whom was Müller.86 As for thedental and other forensic evidence, one Bormann expert confided to Paul Manningthat “Bormann planned this flight with extreme care and part of the grand designwas a scheme to lead future forensic and dental specialists astray.”87But the most important evidence are the radio messages that Bormann sent toDönitz during the period from April 30th to May 1st. According to the officialstandard history, Adolf and Eva Hitler committed suicide around 3:30 pm on April30, about twelve hours after Reitsch’s and Von Greim’s flight out of Berlin. Atapproximately 5:30 the same afternoon, Bormann radioed the Admiral that he hadbeen chosen as Hitler’s successor, but he did not inform Dönitz that Hitler wasdead. Dönitz, who was not about to be tricked into treasonous acts as had beenGöring and Himmler – again at Bormann’s trickery – insisted that Bormann supplywitnesses to this effect, which Bormann did not do.As Hydrick observes, every tactic of interpreting this exchange along thestandard lines of his presence in the bunker, and eventual death while trying toflee on foot, fail. They were totally meaningless exchanges on this view. Butthey do make sense if Bormann was already on the flight with Von Greim, Reitsch,and Müller, and simply no longer present in Berlin at all. Hence, Bormann didnot know of Hitler’s suicide, nor could he provide witnesses.88There was also a legal reason for keeping knowledge of the Führer’s suicide fromthe Admiral, for “once Doenitz knew Hitler was dead, the Admiral’s command wouldbe law and Bormann would be one of the first of Hitler’s paladins he would seekto bring down, and Bormann knew it.”89 Hence, Bormann most likely sent his lastmessage to Doenitz on May 1. This is the message known to most historians whereBormann informed the Admiral that Hitler’s last will and testament’s politicalprovisions were in force, though, once again, he carefully avoided mentioningthat Hitler was dead. Bormann most likely sent the message from Hamburg, leavingthe Admiral to assume he was still in Berlin.90There is more circumstantial evidence to support the conclusion that Bormann wasno longer in Berlin from April 30th onward. For example, the official version ofhistory maintains that Josef Göbbels forced Bormann to sign the document thatnotified Admiral Dönitz of Hitler’s demise. But a photograph of the actualdocument shows only Göbbels’ signature; Bormann’s is completely absent. Moreimportantly, all communications up to April 30th between the bunker and theAdmiral had gone through Bormann, since he controlled both the bunker’stelephone exchange as well as its radio communications center. But on April30th, Göbbels takes command of them, “an event,” notes Hydrick, “not likely tohave been allowed by Bormann had he still been there. Apparently, judging fromthe evidence, the Reichsleiter seems to have left the premises.”91Finally, as if all of this were not enough, British Field Marshall Sir BernardLaw Montgomery was said to have maintained that British intelligence received areport of Bormann in Hamburg during the night of May 1, 1945.It’s beginning to look like, for once, Stalin was telling the truth.(b) The Movements of the U-234 There are, however, still details of the scenario that remain to be filled in.As noted in the previous section, the massive U-234 and its precious uraniumcargo left Norway on April 16th, 1945, probably on the prearranged signal of thebeginning of the Russian artillery bombardment of Berlin. Bormann, in turn, ifone accepts Hydrick’s scenario, as this author most decidedly does, did notarrive in Hamburg until sometime on April 30th or May 1st. Thence he and Müllerdeparted on the U-234, using the cover they knew the Americans would accord toits cargo to effect their own escapes.But what was the U-234 doing during this time, and equally importantly, what didit do after leaving Germany with its new passengers? Hydrick summarizes thismysterious period in no uncertain terms:> There are more mysteries about U-234 than its enigmatic passengers and cargo.> The whereabouts of U-234 from 16 April until 12 May 1945, almost a month, is a> mystery hidden by a series of riddles, to the point of almost being a> conundrum – an unsolvable puzzle. Review of the U-boat’s logbook itself> reveals a perplexing collection of contradictions when compared against> intercepted radio transmissions, other accounts of the voyage, and even other> information within the same logbook, suggesting that at least part of its> record is falsified. In fact, even a cursory glance at what are purported to> be various pages of the war log reveals astounding inconsistencies in the> physical nature of the book and the handwriting therein, leading to questions> and doubt regarding its very provenance. In addition, the few apparently clear> facts provided by the war log reveal a bizarre and unexpected travel routine> for a fleeing U-boat. And the actions taken by the U-boat commander in the> final days prior to its surrender are duplicitous and deceitful – and> apparently in coordination with United States Navy activities.> In short, the evidence suggests that U-234 may not have left Norway under the> conditions reported, may not have cruised the course across the Atlantic it> was claimed to have traveled, and definitely did not surrender when, where,> and to whom it was ordered to capitulate. Instead, in almost every case, its> commander, Captain Lieutenant Johann Heinrich Fehler, appears to have been> intent on achieving a different, unknown end.92 As already indicated, the “Bubbi” message was perhaps code for the U-234 toreturn to Germany, a possibility Hydrick himself entertains.93As also noted, after the famous “Bubbi” message, the U-234 received a messagefrom Grand Admiral Dönitz himself ordering the ship’s captain, Fehler, to sea assoon as preparations were complete. As a result, notes Hydrick, Fehler was putin the unenviable position of having to answer to two separate chains ofcommand, to disobey either of which would seriously jeopardize not only hiscareer but perhaps his very life itself.94 Fehler’s solution to this dilemma wasrather ingenious, for he contrived to fulfill both sets of orders, for as TopSecret Allied Ultra intercepts indicate, the U-boat seems to have left porttwice, once on April 16th, in fulfillment of the prearranged signal from Berlin,and once on April 18th, in fulfillment of Dönitz’s orders.95As if to compound this contradictory state of affairs, the U-boat’s own logs putit some 200 miles further north than the April 16th intercept, which stated itwas sailing on a southern course. In fact, the U-boat’s logs show it to be muchfurther north in the environs of Bergen, Norway!96 And complicating matters evenfurther, the war log ends on April 18th, and is replaced by another “official”log!A clue to resolution of the discrepancy is given in Hirschfeld’s memoirs, wherehe records that the commander of U-boats for the northern region, Captain HansRosing, sailed out to the U-boat and boarded it from a launch, a hazardousundertaking to say the least, given Allied air supremacy over the North Sea! ButHydrick notes that Rosing was headquartered in Bergen, not Kristansand muchfurther south, from which the U-234 departed. Hydrick reaches the obviousconclusion: the U-234 had been diverted northward for some very secret purpose,which was directly and personally communicated to the U-boat’s officers by thenorthern commander of U-boat forces personally. Hence, the “official” log bookreplaces the normal war log book from that point onward.97 This special contactmay in fact have been to bring to the U-boat directly more top secretcommunications directly from the Führerbunker or perhaps to install special highfrequency radio equipment to allow the ship to continue receiving communicationsfrom Hitler’s headquarters while at sea.98But what of the strange discrepancy between the two logbooks?> Why does one logbook end abruptly and its supposed sequel not jive with the> rest of the evidence regarding U-234’s movements? When I first requested a> copy of the captured war log of U-234 from United States archives at the> beginning of my research, I was told by an archivist that the logbook had been> thrown into the sea by U-234’s captain. He asserted that Fehler got rid of the> journal prior to the U-boat’s surrender to avoid compromising the document and> the boat’s movements.> But U-234 carried Nazi Germany’s greatest secret weapons, I reasoned,> including the V-4 rocket, the Messerschmidt (sic) 262 jet fighter, all of the> plans and documents required to manufacture them, atomic bomb components and> presumably plans to build those weapons, as well. If Fehler did not know the> important details about his freight, which seems improbable despite his later> claims, he at least knew the basic reason for and deep importance of his> cargo, passengers and mission, and yet he surrendered them all intact. I> reasoned that this was a significant incongruity. Had Captain Fehler> surrendered the valuable Nazi secrets and personnel, supposedly with little> more than a second thought, but had refused to surrender his comparatively> trivial logbook? The journal, presumably, simply reported the course he> cruised prior to surrender. What could be damning about that if the story was> as simple as suggested? No, the logbook itself apparently held important> secrets that Fehler did not want revealed, and thus Fehler had indeed> consigned it to the deep and we would never know U-234’s whereabouts between> 16 April and 12 May 1945. Or, possibly, the book was intact but held damning> evidence, and thus was being kept in some separate archive, out of circulation> from prying eyes.99 Uncovering a microfilm version of the logbook, Hydrick then discovered thatthere are indeed no entries from April 18th – the date of the U-234’s “second”departure from Kristiansand – and May 12th, 1945, when the U-234 firsttransmitted its intention to surrender to the Allies.100Undaunted, Hydrick then inquired where the original copy of this microfilmedlogbook was, and was informed that it had been returned to Germany to becomepart of the German Bundesarchiv or Federal archives. Needless to say, he orderedcopies of the logbook from April 19, 1945, to May 12, 1945.This new logbook quickly revealed problems of its own, for its stated courses,speeds and coordinates varied significantly from Allied radio direction findingcoordinates, and more importantly, its handwriting, in the opinion of one USNavy expert consulted by Hydrick, was much too neat to have been made undernormal operational conditions, a fact suggesting that the whole logbook was acarefully doctored copy of an original.101 All the evidence forced Hydrick toconclude that there was “an organized effort to camouflage U-234’smovements.”102 The only questions were who doctored the records, and why?But this new log contained yet another astounding fact: during most of theperiod from April 18 to May 12, it was barely moving, maintaining a mere one totwo and a half miles per hour, barely enough speed to maintain the craft’ssteerage.103 To put it succinctly, while the standard history of the U-boatwould have it that the craft was racing toward Japan at its surface speed of 20knots, “the slow speed recorded in the log seems to suggest that Fehler wasmarking time in an unexplained effort to remain close to home.”104 And accordingto the same logbook, during the crucial period from April 30, 1945, to late May5, 1945, the same time frame from Bormann’s disappearance from Berlin toDönitz’s signal to the Allies of his intention to capitulate on May 5, 1945, theU-boat ran submerged continuously for six days.105 The purpose of thesesubmerged meanderings were, for Hydrick, quite clear: the U-boat was actuallymaking a very secret “side trip,” one that, perhaps, its new passengers, Bormannand Müller, wished to conceal after the fact from prying American eyes.106Then, through a series of carefully chronicled deceitful communications andmaneuvers,107 Captain Fehler avoided Canadian orders to surrender to Canadianand British authorities at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and instead piloted his boat toa safe rendezvous with the US destroyer Sutton, which had under aid of radiojamming from America designed to cut off British and Canadian communication withthe submarine, signaled the U-boat by semaphore to proceed to the Gulf of Maineand “to ignore all further communications from Halifax.”108 Meanwhile, theU-boat’s radio operator Hirschfeld recorded in his memoirs that he observed Dr.Heinz Schlicke, the inventor of the crucial infrared proximity fuses, throwingcanisters of microfilm into the ocean from the submarine’s conning tower,stating “There goes the rocket that could fly the Atlantic,”109 a statementthat, if true, corroborates my argument in The SS Brotherhood of the Bell thatthe Nazis may not only have successfully exploded an atom bomb prior to the endof the war, but successfully test fired an actual intercontinental ballisticmissile designed to carry it to targets in the United States. Bormann’s “deal”with the Americans had now revealed its teeth.Weighing all the evidence – and we have summarized only very briefly Hydrick’sintricate and meticulously researched scenario – he comes to his finalconclusion that the U-234 was indeed> “the large U-boat” reported by Soviet intelligence that had the secret mission> of rescuing Martin Bormann from Germany, delivering him safely to Spain, and> delivering the cargo to the United States in exchange for Bormann’s> freedom.110 While agreed with Hydrick on the probable likelihood that the U-234 indeedtransported Bormann and Müller to the safety of Nationalist Spain, and whileacknowledging that it was probably part of an extremely secret deal between theNazi Reichsleiter and high level American intelligence authorities – recallagain Dulles’ comment to researcher Paul Manning, and ask yourself how Dulleswould have known Manning was “on the right track” – it is also true, as we shallsee in subsequent chapters, that the activities of Bormann’s Nazi Internationalwould hardly have been pleasing or acceptable to Bormann’s erstwhile Americanallies. It was, for both, but a marriage of convenience, and a very temporaryone at that.But given very real possibility that Bormann did not offer himself or Müller aspart of the original agreement, but only offered the Americans the enricheduranium and infrared proximity fuses, and thus used U-234 as a shield to coverhis and his Gestapo colleague’s escape under what he knew would be tacit highlevel American efforts designed to ensure the U-boat’s safe passage, whatleverage might he have held onto to coerce or ensure American cooperation in thefuture? That is a question for future chapters.However, there is a much larger context from which to view the escapes ofBormann and Müller and the surrender of the U-234’s atom bomb components thaneven Hydrick himself surmised, and that is the context of the Nazi Bell device,and the probable escape of the man who ultimately controlled it – SS GeneralHans Kammler – and again, the key player in this regard is Martin Bormann.But first, there is some interesting corroboration of Hydrick’s scenario thathas recently come to light in the recollection of a former Spanish spy for theNazis.4. The Velasco Scenario A review of the outlines of Bormann’s escape, according to all the massiveamount of material unearthed by Carter Hydrick, is in order, so that we mayappreciate the story of Velasco. In Hydrick’s scenario, we have the followingelements:> 1) Bormann negotiated the surrender of Nazi Germany’s atom bomb components,> including enriched uranium-235, and quite possibly actual plans for an atom> bomb, to the United States in return for his and Heinrich Müller’s safe> passage aboard the U-234 to the Bay of Biscay;> 2) Once in Spanish waters, Bormann and Müller were covertly transferred by> boat or motor launch to Spanish shores, where they remained while Bormann> finished business in Europe;> 3) Bormann and Müller most likely boarded the U-234 sometime between April 30> and May 1st or 2nd, during the period that the U-boat was apparently marking> time submerged somewhere in the waters of the North Sea; once transferred, the> U-boat made its way through the English channel to Spanish waters,> accomplished the transfer, and then proceeded to surrender to U.S. authorities> as per the previously negotiated arrangement;> 4) As components of their carefully orchestrated escape from Berlin, Bormann> and Müller used carefully placed (and expendable) body doubles designed to> create several trails for the Allies to follow, each of which ended in a> “dead” Bormann or Müller; and,> 5) Body doubles were also used after the war to create a spate of “Bormann> sightings” throughout Europe to obscure his real location and movements. Implicit in this whole scenario is the possibility that Bormann also drove ahard bargain with his American counterparts, namely, that the U.S. would makeonly token efforts to roll up his camouflage and dummy corporations, and keepsits hands off any projects he did not wish to fall into Allied hands.It was a policy Bormann could well afford to insist upon, for most likelyknowing as well of the secret agreement between Dulles and General ReinhardGehlen, as well as of America’s mad scramble to recover and recruit Naziscientists for America’s space program, Bormann knew he would have theon-the-ground personnel to “enforce” his demands if the situation required it.It was, in short, the time-tested Bormann method: blackmail, with teeth.America, wishing a quick end to the war and to avoid the bloodshed that aninvasion of the Japanese home islands would cost, cut the bargain, and droppedthe uranium bomb made possible by Bormann’s uranium and the plutonium bomb madepossible by Bormann’s infrared proximity fuses (and possibly Bormann’s atom bombplans as well).With this scenario in mind, it is time to summarize the story of Spanish Nazispy and sympathizer Don Angel Alcazar de Velasco.In an account published by Sharkhunters only after Velasco’s death, entitledEscape from the Bunker, Velasco recounts his alleged last days in Berlin servingas a Spanish liaison in the Bunker, once again in service of Bormann’s strategicevacuation plan. Velasco minces no words about his own opinion of Bormann’spostwar Nazi International:> (The Nazis) considered me one of their most trusted agents with access to> their closely guarded plans for re-emergence as a world power.> I know the power of these men and their underground organization. I have seen> the determination with which they plotted their return to power, and have> helped with the formation of secret action groups in two continents. They are> well organized. The High Command still exists and meets each year in western> Germany, where they do not lack support.111 In this capacity, Velasco was summoned to the Bunker where, according to hisallegations, he remained up through the final events.There Velasco observed the quickly deteriorating mental and physical health ofHitler, even describing symptoms that resemble Parkinson’s disease.112 Allegedlyobserving the relationship of Hitler and Bormann firsthand, Velasco noted that“Hitler could hardly have turned around in those days without finding theattentive Bormann at his elbow. And such ready attention was to pay off forMartin Bormann. Before the end, he was to take charge, even over his oldmaster.”113 But the most serious allegation concerns Hitler’s and EvaBraun-Hitler’s escape, for shortly after hearing some official radioproclamation concerning the Führer, Velasco claims he saw the door of Hitler’sprivate quarters open. Eva Braun appeared, a fur coat folded over her arm andcarrying a vanity case in her right hand. She was, according to Velasco,escorted from the Bunker by an SS colonel. Shortly after this, Velasco statesthat he observed Hitler appear in the company of Field Marshal Wilhelm Keiteland Colonel-General Alfred Jodl… and Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz! These events,according to Velasco, transpired on April 21, the day after Hitler’sbirthday.114It was this odd detail that first convinced Sharkhunters president and founder,Harry Cooper, to dismiss Velasco’s whole story – recounted to him in a personalletter from Velasco – as a wild fabrication. Cooper, however, also contacted thehead of Dönitz’s personal guard to ask him if the Admiral was ever in Berlinduring March or April of 1945. Much to his surprise, the individual respondedthat according to his notes from the period, the Grand Admiral was indeed inBerlin on the very date Velasco had specified.115In any case, Velasco went on to outline a scenario of Hitler’s escape – not EvaBraun’s – that included the use of a carefully replaced Hitler double in thebunker from April 21st to April 30th, an arrangement made by Bormann.116 Weshall say more about Velasco’s scenario of Hitler’s escape in the next chapter,but suffice it for the moment to observe that the method of operation here isexactly that used in his own and Müller’s escape: doubles.What interests us here is Velasco’s account of Bormann’s own escape, which hemaintains was to Spain, via a U-boat, and thence from Spain to Argentina, withVelasco in tow, in 1946 on a “black U-boat” still conducting covert operationsunder orders from Nazis long after the war had ended.117 As we shall see in asubsequent chapter, the idea of German U-boats conducting independent operationsunder a still functional Nazi chain of command long after the war had ended isnot as far-fetched as it might at first glance seem.5. A Reconciliation and Reconstruction In any case, Velasco’s story, with its oddly corroborated mention of Dönitz’spresence in the bunker on April 21, 1945, also broadly corroborates Hydrick’smeticulous reconstruction of Bormann’s and Müller’s probable movements fromApril 30, 1945 to their arrival in Nationalist Spain prior to May 12, 1945 onthe U-234. Where Velasco differs in his account is how Bormann made it toArgentina, for as we shall see in a subsequent chapter, Argentine intelligencedocuments date his arrival in that country to 1948, not to 1946, as Velascomaintains, and moreover, they have Bormann arriving on a freighter from Genoa,Italy, disguised as a Jesuit priest, and not on a U-boat.Even these discrepancies might be reconciled, however, if one recalls thesupposition advanced here that Bormann used many doubles to sew the confusion ofa spate of postwar “Bormann sightings” throughout Europe. It is entirelypossible that one such double was either on the U-boat with Velasco, or on thefreighter from Genoa, or both.B. The Escape of SS Obergruppenführer Hans Kammler As implied earlier, there is a wider context than even the machinationssurrounding the Nazi surrender of crucial atom bomb components to the Americanson the U-234, and that context is the escape of SS General Hans Kammler and ofthe Nazis’ most highly classified secret weapons project, the Bell. As I detailin my book Reich of the Black Sun, Kammler’s probable escape from Europe followsa by-now familiar pattern, for the stories of his death come in no less thanfour mutually conflicting versions, a pattern we have already seen repeated withthe escape of Bormann and Müller.1181. Agoston: The Priest Disguise and a Bormann Parallel But as I also recount in that book, Kammler himself confided, at one point, thathe intended to escape to a Roman Catholic monastery, where, disguised as a monkand priest, he would eventually flee Europe.119 This story was disclosed by noneother than Dr. Wehrner Von Braun! Again, the parallel to Argentine intelligencedocuments recording Bormann’s own escape from Europe disguised as a Jesuitpriest goes without mention. And obviously, in both cases, a Vatican connectionis implied. But in Kammler’s case there is something more, and that is that heknew beforehand of this possibility of escape.2. Nick Cook and the Luftwaffe’s Kampfgeschwader 200: TheEscape of Kammler and the Bell Courtesy of Martin Bormann But there is another possible escape route for Kammler, one first mentioned byPolish Bell researcher Igor Witkowski, and corroborated by fresh research ofBritish journalist Nick Cook in his book The Hunt for Zero Point. Noting thatMartin Bormann had personally turned over to General Kammler the Luftwaffe’sKampfgeschwader 200, the unit that operated all of Nazi Germany’s long-rangeheavy lift four engine Junkers 290 and is sole remaining six-engine Junkers 390,Witkowski and Cook speculate that the enormous aircraft, last photographed inPrague in April, 1945, as it was being loaded with cargo,120 the same time frameas the events recounted in Bormann and Müller’s escape in Hydrick’s scenario,made its way from there, with possibly the Bell itself, its projectdocumentation (which would have been kept by Kammler at the headquarters of hissecret weapons think tank in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, near Prague) and thegeneral himself. From Prague it flew the general and the Bell first to Bodoairbase in Norway, and thence to disappear into the postwar black projects ofthe United States.But as I mentioned in The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, British author GeoffreyBrooks maintained that the flight ended, not in America, but in Argentina.121 AsBrooks maintains in his own book Hitler’s Terror Weapons: From V-1 to Vimana,the Bell was deliberately withheld by Bormann from the Allies.To put it succinctly, Bormann surrendered the atom bomb components aboard theU-234 to the Americans, while simultaneously giving Kammler direct control ofthe last remaining Junkers 390 in order to spirit the far more valuable Belldevice and its documentation to Argentina, where it would remain in Nazi hands.The Junkers 390 was fully capable of making the non-stop flight from Germany toArgentina without the necessity of stopping for fuel.But is that what in fact happened?As already mentioned, Witkowski and Cook site evidence that the 390 flew toNorway, and thence conjecture that it flew from there on to America. Can aflight to Norway be reconciled with a flight to Argentina?Indeed it can, and indeed, it may have been altogether necessary to take such acircuitous route, for a direct flight from Czechoslovakia, where the last knownpicture of the Junkers 390 was taken, to Argentina, would have flown overairspace directly controlled by the Allies, whether it flew over France, Italy,or the Balkans makes no difference. Once over the bulge of Africa the way wouldhave been clear for the relatively short hop over the Atlantic to the coast ofBrazil, and then down the coast to Argentina. But it was negotiating that firstleg of the journey over hostile airspace that would have been the most dangerousfor an easily spotted massive aircraft like the Junkers 390.So why Norway?Given the importance of the Bell in the hierarchy of Nazi secret weapons, andthe self-evident desire of Bormann to maintain independent Nazi control of theproject and the physics it represented, not to mention his probable desire toprotect its ultimate project head, General Kammler and the detailed knowledge ofthe project that he doubtless had, the flight to Norway makes sense, for theJunkers 390 could easily fly out over the relatively quieter airspace of theNorth Atlantic to Nazi-friendly Nationalist Spain in a gigantic loop. Once inSpain it could refuel, and, if need be, take on additional cargo or passengersfor the final leg of the flight to Argentina. In the light of evidence presentedlater in this book that some aspect of the Bell project continued to beresearched in Argentina by Nazi scientists, this is now my preferred and favoredview of what happened to the Bell, General Kammler, and the last flight of theJunkers 390.D. Conclusions: A Possible Scenario Summarizing all that has gone before, we are now in a position to outline thelarger scenario of the “escape of the Unholy Trinity,” Bormann, Müller, andKammler, the three men who, as the quotation that began this chapter avers,represented the necessary expertise to the continuation of any independentlycontrolled Nazi secret weapons project, for each of the three men representedexpertise in handling and camouflaging large amounts of money (Bormann), thesecurity necessary to protect the organization and its projects (Müller), andthe administrative requirements of handling an advanced research project likethe Bell (Kammler).Bormann and Müller arranged for body doubles to be planted and anescape-and-death scenario cultivated for postwar Allied and Sovietinvestigators, while arranging their flight from Berlin by air, and thence toHamburg where the two boarded the U-234 which Bormann knew, by dint of a secretarrangement negotiated directly with the Americans – very likely through OSSstation chief in Zurich, Allen Dulles – that the U-234 would receive quiet andcovert protection from them in order to secure the safe arrival of its nuclearcargo in the United States. This implies further that Bormann at least, andMüller and Kammler most likely, were accurately apprised on the actual state ofaffairs in the Manhattan Project, and knew of its crucial shortages of fissileuranium-235 as well as of its difficulties in making a plutonium bomb workablewithout the infusion that the U-234’s infrared proximity fuses could provide.122Requiring a project that would not require the large facilities needed by rocketprograms or atom bombs, and one that promised to pay far larger dividends in anycase, Bormann surrendered the atom bomb components, while seeing to it that theBell safely escaped. Kammler and the Bell flew to Argentina, where they wouldbecome the nucleus of an ongoing independent Nazi project, as we shall seelater. Bormann and Müller joined him there subsequently.But before we can examine that case, we need first to examine another possible,and highly significant, escape, as well as examining the “rodents at the otherend of the ratlines,” and the postwar political activities of Bormann’s NaziInternational, in order to put it all in perspective. By now, however, it isabundantly clear that the broad outlines of Wilhelm Landig’s science fictionnovels are anything but fiction.1 William Stevenson, The Bormann Brotherhood (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1973),p. 164.2 Q.v.

But the PoliceGazette article contains something most of these reports and stories do not:specifics. Let us observe carefully what these are, for these points will assumemuch greater significance in the light of information to be presented in partthree:> 1) Long after the end of the war and the concoction of the Hitler suicide> story under the aegis of British Intelligence – about which more in a moment –> “Allied Intelligence,” according to the article, allegedly carried out> investigations and compiled “reports and information based on interviews with> former members of the Wehrmacht” to the effect that both Adolf and Eva Hitler> had escaped Berlin;> 2) The plans for this escape were completed by none other than Martin Bormann> – whose probable escape from Berlin was examined in the previous chapter – who> was aided and abetted in this effort by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz;> 3) Dönitz’s now famous remark about the German Navy having constructed an> “impregnable fortress” is then cited, though in a most unusual version, for in> the normal version Dönitz is alleged to have located this “impregnable> fortress” in a landscape covered in ice, which has led many to speculate that> Dönitz was referring to a secret base constructed in Antarctica.

We shall reserve comments on Hitler’s alleged presencein Bariloche or its environs to the end of this chapter. For now, we shalladdress the problems posed by the history’s standard version of Adolf and EvaHitler’s suicides.B. Will the Real Adolf Hitler Please Die? 1. The Nexus Magazine Series by Giordan Smith The March-April 2008 issue of Nexus magazine concludes a captivating andthought-provoking three-part series of articles by independent Australianhistorian and researcher Giordan Smith questioning the whole accepted version ofHitler’s last days in Berlin and his suicide. The question assumes someimportance, in the light of the evidence and arguments that Mr. Smith presents,since I have argued in my two of my previous books on Nazi secret weapons, Reichof the Black Sun and The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, that the malevolentoutlines of some sort of “Nazi International” may clearly be detected in thepost-war West and Latin America. Moreover, in my most recent book addressing thesubject of the escape of top level Nazis Bormann, Kammler, and Müller, as wasseen in the previous chapter, I outlined the shape of a powerful triumverate atthe top of this International consisting of SS Obergruppenfuehrers Heinrich“Gestapo” Mueller, Dr. Ing Hans Kammler, and Nazi Party Reichsleiter MartinBormann. This triumverate, moreover, was the perfect combination to administerany ongoing Nazi International’s continuing and independent postwar developmentof the exotic technologies the Nazi regime had begun to investigate prior to andduring the war, since the three represented a combination of security,administrative, and financial capabilities.As most readers are also probably aware, more recently, Richard C. Hoagland andMike Bara provided yet another approach to the possibility of the continuance ofthe Nazi ideological and technological agenda with their New York Timesbestselling book Dark Mission: The Secret History of NASA. And as I observed inmy own first two books on Nazi secret weapons, the presence and power of thispost-war Nazi International does provide a way to speculatively rationalize thedegeneration of American culture and politics into the increasingly Fascistavenues and mores of the police state “snitch culture” modern America hasbecome. Similarly, it provides a method, as I outline in The SS Brotherhood ofthe Bell, of explaining and interpreting many of the odd events - otherwiseinexplicable - towards the end of World War Two, up to, and beyond, the JFKassassination.But as I also made clear in Reich of the Black Sun, I did not, at the time ofwriting that book, subscribe to the possibility of Adolf Hitler’s survival andescape from Berlin. But Giordan Smith’s Nexus series, and particularly the finalpart, raises the stakes significantly enough that I now begin to entertain theidea, and ponder its broader implications within the context of the scenario ofthe escape of Bormann, Müller, and Kammler. What if, after all, the chiefhimself did survive? And if he did, what does it mean in terms of the NaziInternational and its covert post-war power, agenda, and influence?Giordan’s article in the March-April 2008 Nexus begins by pointing out the onemajor sticking point in the post-war Allied standard history of Hitler’ssuicide, the version concocted largely by Hugh Trevor-Roper and under the aegisof British intelligence. The sticking point, quite bluntly, is the consistentpost-war Soviet attitude of skepticism toward the whole “death of Hitler inBerlin” scenario, a sticking point that was also seen with Stalin’s own personalbelief that Martin Bormann had also escaped the Reich, as was seen in theprevious chapter.Giordan Smith begins the third and final part of his series by noting that anAmerican war correspondent in Berlin, one Joseph W. Grigg, announced on May 8,1945, that Hitler’s body had been found. But on May 10 the same Grigg reportedthat a further four bodies, “blackened and charred, that seem to answer toHitler’s general appearance” were drug out of the ruins of theReichschancellery.2 Ironically, this sounds remarkably similar to the fourdifferent versions of SS General Hans Kammler’s death as I recounted in Reich ofthe Black Sun and as synopsized in the previous chapter. Within another fivedays, Grigg reported that the number of possible Hitler corpses had risen tosix, forcing Grigg to admit that the Soviets were beginning to despair of makingany definite identification of a body, and thus to have any definite orconclusive evidence of the fact that Adolf Hitler had indeed died!The Soviets, notes Smith, continued to insist that they were skeptical. Noneother than Marshal Zhukov himself admitted, in a press conference on June 9,1945 attended by representatives of the British, French, and American press,that the Russians “had found no corpses which could be Hitler’s.” The marshaladded that he considered it a definite possibility that Hitler had escapedBerlin by air.3 Adding to the Allies’ problems were the fact that Stalin, as iswell known, confided to various American delegates at the Potsdam Conferencethat he believed Hitler had escaped.Compounding the difficulties represented by the Soviets, Smith also points outthat, once they had decided on a set of corpses to identify as Adolf and EvaHitler’s, these were in turn buried and unburied no less than three times, onceat an undisclosed location in Berlin, then moved to Finov in the Soviet Union,and then once again moved back to Germany and reburied in Rathenau. Even thenthe traveling corpses were not done, for they were exhumed once more and movedto Friedrichshafen. As Smith observes, “It would be hard to account for thismacabre traveling show if the Soviets were sure that the bodies they had foundwere really those of the Hitler couple.”4The ultimate origins of the suicide interpretation, as Smith points out, wereHitler’s chauffeur Erich Kempka, and Dr. Joseph Göbbels’ second in command atthe Propaganda Ministry, Dr. Fritzsche. As Smith notes, this places the wholesuicide legend in yet another problematical light, for London and Washington,which had maintained throughout the war the view “that the Nazis wereunconscionable liars” there was, as regards the suicide story - even when one ofthe sources was Göbbels’ second in command! - a “dramatic shift away fromskepticism”. In other words, “any Nazi who claimed to know that Hitler hadcommitted suicide never risked having his or her veracity impugned. Clearly, allNazis were liars - except those who told the Allies what they wanted to hear.”5Smith observes that there are other significant problems with the suicideversion as well, not the least of which is its most famous expositor: HughTrevor-Roper, the same Trevor-Roper who was taken in by the spurious Hitlerdiaries fraud in the 1980s.6 In other words, Trevor-Roper’s investigative skillsdo not, Smith implies, seem quite adequate to the task, the more so since he didnot have access to any of the Führerbunker survivors in Soviet captivity, andwas dependent on American summaries of interviews of detainees in the Russians’possession. Here, observes Smith, Trevor-Roper seems to have been taken entirelyby American fabrications of an interview with Hitler’s famous test pilot, HannahReitsch. But Reitsch herself later repudiated the interview as reported inTrevor-Roper’s book in no uncertain terms: “When I was released by theAmericans, I read Trevor-Roper’s book, The Last Days of Hitler. Throughout thebook, like a red line, runs an eyewitness report by Hanna Reitsch about thefinal days in the bunker. I never said it. I never wrote it. I never signed it.It was something they invented. Hitler died with total dignity.”7The mention of Hanna Reitsch and her repudiation of the report as recorded byTrevor-Roper, raises what is perhaps the most glaring anomaly of them all in thesuicide version: hers and General Robert Ritter von Greim’s desperate anddangerous flight in a Fiesler Storch to Berlin in late April of 1945, andRietsch’s skillful landing of the small reconnaissance aircraft on s boulevardduring a Russian artillery barrage. Many of us know the Trevor-Roper version ofthe story from the famous film, Hitler’s Last Ten Days, starring Sir AlecGuinness as an increasingly deranged and insane Hitler, totally out of touchwith military realities and living out his last desperate fantasies in thebunker, and clinging doggedly to his power, even at that late date, to makepeople serve his slightest whim, no matter how loony.As was seen in the previous chapter, the story is that Hitler had Reitsch flyGeneral Von Greim to Berlin to appoint him head of the Luftwaffe in the wake ofGöring’s attempt to seize the government, and Hitler’s denunciation of theReichsmarschal for treason. In the movie, a bewildered Reitsch and Von Greim are- quite reasonably - dumbfounded that they risked their lives for something sotrivial. The point is made: Hitler was nuts, and the flight itself wasfoolhardy.But, at this point, there is a serious discrepancy – as was seen in the previouschapter as well - and it has all the hallmarks of a cover story being put out.Notes Smith:> Why would Hitler, who was anxious for everyone else to leave Berlin, want> someone to come to him? Why would he have been so keen to talk to the head of> an almost non-existent entity?8 The official story fails to justify Greim and> Reitsche’s extremely dangerous flight. It also does not explain why the pair’s> flight from the Luftwaffe airbase at Rechlin near Berlin to Gatow airport on> Berlin’s periphery was accompanied by an escort of 30-40 fighter jets - in> other words, the extant Luftwaffe virtually in its entirety. Clearly the> flight had a more serious purpose than we have been led to believe.”9 Smith even observes that it is Carter Hydrick’s thesis that the flight was infact to smuggle Martin Bormann out of Berlin! And note the new detail, for Smithalleges that the flight had a rather sturdy escort of almost 40 jet fighters. Iftrue, then this means that the all-but-extinct Luftwaffe, now under the commandof newly appointed and promoted Field Marshal Von Greim, was taking no chancesthat its cargo – whatever, or whomever, it was – was going to be shot down orforced away from its ultimate destination.10Smith even presents eyewitness evidence of a Hitler Youth soldier who happenedupon an SS radio post in Berlin, and of hearing a radio report that Hitler hadreceived his birthday present and had been successfully flown out of Berlin byHanna Reitsch in that very same Fiesler Storch! From there, the rest of theflight is recounted by Hanna Reitsch: she flew back to Rechlin, where Von Greim“attended a conference.” From there she and Von Greim flew to Plön, headquartersof Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, then to Dobbin, headquarters of Field MarshalKeitel, then to Lübeck, and once again back to Plön, once again to see Dönitz.From there, in the strangest odyssey of all, she and Von Greim flew to theunlikely place of Königgrätz, in Bohemian Czechoslovakia! Could this last leg ofthe flight have been to coordinate something with the Kammler Group, somethingthat could only be done in person and not over risky radio or phonecommunications? Perhaps.To put it succinctly, Smith’s reconstruction and Reitsch’s own memoirs have herflying to make contact with all the important figures in Carter Hydrick’s escapescenario, and more besides, for her last flight also brings her into theproximity of Kammler’s secret weapons think tank. It looks, in other words, anawfully lot like last minute coordination was occurring, coordination that couldnot be entrusted to the normal telephone and radio communications of the HighCommand for the simple reason that it included human cargo.It is here that Smith’s three part series ends, and the real questions begin,for if one assumes that Hitler did survive, and moreover, escaped Berlin andGermany successfully, where did he go? And what did he do once he arrived there?It would simply be unreasonable in the extreme to assume that he went elsewherein Europe. After all, as history’s most notorious criminal, and having justsavaged Europe for five and a half years, there would have been no safe havenfor him there. Only Franco’s Nationalist Spain would have been relativelywelcoming, and even then, Hitler would have been with easy reach of Allied orSoviet “special operations teams.”The only other possibility of a relatively secure and welcoming refuge wouldhave been Latin America. There the situation would have been more secure,especially given the pro-Nazi sympathies of some Latin American governments ingeneral, and of one in particular, as will be shown in the next chapter.2. Two Possibilities There are two other remaining possibilities that are disturbing, but that mustbe mentioned. One place, of course, for the ex-Führer of the totally eclipsedGreater German Reich to go would have been the alleged “secret base” inAntarctica. Even granting the very unlikely possibility that such a baseactually existed, one cannot imagine Hitler, who had by this time becomeaccustomed to living in some luxury, managing to be happy in a spartan anddoubtless small living quarters surrounded by miles of cold and ice, andsurviving on sea lions and penguins! Which leaves a final possibility…thatHitler’s escape had been coordinated, not only by Bormann and his henchmen andusing the standard means of doubles, doctored dental records, and so on, butwith other outside parties, who decided to take him in and screen him in “thanksfor a job well done.” On this view, Hitler, in effect, went to ground with thevery people who had put him into power. It would seem to take, at some point,the knowledge and connivance of a great power with the intelligence and securityresources to keep a secret of that magnitude secret for that long, and tomaintain for decades a cover story that looks increasingly to be as shaky as apristine bullet on a stretcher in Dallas, Texas, in 1963.Of these possibilities, then, we end with two as being the most probable, if theescape scenario is true, and both of them end with “America.”But as will now be shown, the most likely of these two possibilities ends withLatin America, and with the Nazi International’s most hospitable host:Argentina, and dictator Juan Domingo Perón.C. Back to Velasco’s Story: Hitler’s Escape, and Eva Braun’s Death The allegations of Don Angel Alcazar de Velasco concerning Bormann’s escape fromBerlin – and his arrangement of Hitler’s escape – were already touched upon inthe previous chapter. Certain details of those allegations, however, now need tobe stated more explicitly. Here are the relevant passages from Velasco’s storyas recounted in his letter to Sharhunters International founder Harry Cooper:> From what Bormann told me and from what I saw in those last hours in the> bunker I have almost satisfied myself as to what actually happened to Hitler.> I know that many people who remained in the bunker after I have left (sic)> have given their own explanation of what took place there and their accounts> are possibly more acceptable than mine. In fact, I do not attempt to discredit> them.> But on the evidence as I know it, this is my reconstruction. A few minutes> after Hitler had disappeared up the steps leading out of the Führerbunker I> saw for myself a man who bore a startling resemblance to Hitler in stature and> facial features being escorted by three uniformed SS officers into the> Führer’s private apartments. It was commonly accepted that there was on the> Führer’s staff, a man who was said to be his double.> In conversations with Bormann, he was insistent that Hitler had been removed> from the bunker under the influence of drugs on April 21st – the day I shook> hands with him in the bunker corridor. Bormann would not give me any> explanation as to how many apparently reliable witnesses had claimed to have> seen and spoken to Hitler in the bunker right up until his reported suicide on> April 30th, except to say that as creator of the Hitler suicide myth he had> seen to it that all participants had been carefully briefed.> It is only left to me to believe that it was Hitler’s double who, nine days> after I left, was destined to play this most important role in the history of> Nazism. It was this man who was shot through the mouth and whose body, dressed> in Hitler’s uniform, was burned alongside that of Eva Braun in the Chancery> garden that same afternoon.11A little further on, Velasco elaborates more completely on why Bormann hadHitler drugged, and on why Eva Braun-Hitler did not escape with him:> Bormann had left orders that the Führer was to be drugged by force if> necessary, and taken out of Berlin. That’s what happened.> …..> When Bormann appeared at the bunker the last time, Hitler was still determined> to stay and if necessary, prepared to die defending the capital with the> phantom legions which, by then, existed only in his mind. But Bormann had> already assumed command and gave orders that both Hitler and Eva Braun were to> be evacuated from the bunker. They were both forcibly drugged with, it turned> out, fatal results for Eva Braun.> ….> The knowledge that Bormann had countermanded the Führer’s last wish left us> stunned. It seemed incredible that Martin Bormann, the man who had been> Hitler’s faithful lieutenant for twenty years, could perform such a “volte> face.” I had to wait almost a year to hear, from Bormann himself, the true> reason for this seeming piece of treachery.12Velasco would not learn of Bormann’s reasons for the drugging of Hitler and EvaBraun until both he and Bormann were allegedly on a “black” unregistered U-boatbound for Argentina from Spain.On the U-boat, Bormann allegedly finally confided to Velasco his reasons for theforcible removal of the Führer from the bunker and Berlin:> Then he told me the incredible story of Hitler’s fate. He said> “Listen to me carefully and remember what I say. It is true. When Adolf Hitler> left the Führerbunker, he was barely conscious of what was happening. After> months of fighting the enemy on the battlefield and the treachery in his own> camp,13 he was both mentally and physically exhausted.> “But time and again he expressed to me his resolution to die with German> soldiers around him. This I could not allow to happen. Hitler was the> embodiment of the National Socialist cause. One could not survive without the> other. At least not then.> “By the 21st of April (1945) it was obvious that the war was lost. It became> necessary to countermand the Führer’s wishes and remove him physically from> the bunker. I arranged to have him driven secretly from Berlin to Rottach am> Egern, escorted by officers from my personal staff. Only a handful of people> besides myself knew that the Führer was there, and these were people who I> knew could be trusted to keep the secret of his escape for as long as it was> necessary.> “From Rottach he was driven across Germany and smuggled by ship to Norway. Two> of my agents kept him in a place many miles from the nearest village until> arrangements were completed for him to leave Europe.> I asked, “What of Eva Braun and the suicide?”> “Eva Braun never arrived in Norway. Unfortunately she was given an overdose of> drugs from which she later died. As for the suicide, I was the author of the> story that Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide and their bodies were burned> with petrol. Those witnesses who afterwards testified to this end had been> carefully briefed on my instructions.”> Bormann leaned intently across the table; “That Hitler did not die I know. I> also know that he is still alive but more than that I am not prepared at the> moment, to tell you.” And with that I had to be content.14 If one were to rely solely upon Velasco’s account, one would be inclined todismiss the whole story as a pure fabrication, notwithstanding his accuratestatement that Grand Admiral Dönitz was in Berlin on the precise day thatVelasco maintains that Hitler was forcibly removed from the bunker, and a doubleplanted in his place.1. Analysis and Reconciliation of Scenarios It is when viewed in the wider context of (1) Carter Hydrick’s plausiblereconstruction of the scenario of Bormann and Müller’s escape from Berlin on thenight of April 30th, via the Fieseler Storch piloted by Hanna Reitsch and RobertVon Greim, (2) the questions raised from the public record and standard historythat were uncovered by Giordan Smith in his Nexus series, and (3) the 1964Police Gazette article about Hitler’s presence in the environs of Bariloche,Argentina, that the details of Velasco’s story require a second look and muchcloser analysis and scrutiny.Careful reading and an analysis of the implications of the above excerpts fromVelasco’s allegations will reveal the following points and implications:> 1) Hitler was forcibly removed, on Bormann’s orders, from Berlin on April 21,> 1945, nine days prior to his “suicide” in the standard history on April 30th;> 2) Hitler – and Eva Braun – were forcibly drugged to accomplish this;> 3) The time-tested Bormann-Müller modus operandi of substituting a double was> used not only in their escapes, but Hitler’s as well;> 4) Eva Braun died of an “overdose” of the drug intended to render hers and> Hitler’s forcible removals possible;> 5) Bormann had carefully briefed the remaining people in the bunker –> presumably during the period from Hitler’s departure on the 21st to his own> departure(according to the Hydrick scenario) on the 30th – on what their> “cover story”, i.e., the suicide myth, would be;> 6) Hitler escapes to Norway, and thence, presumably, via some route> indirectly, or directly, via U-boat (and hence the succession of power to> Dönitz) to some safe haven outside of Europe;> 7) Bormann needed Hitler alive, “at least for the moment,” to paraphrase> Velasco’s account, in order to ensure the near- future survival of Nazism When this seemingly straightforward list of Velasco’s allegations is comparedwith the standard record, and its own inherent implications are considered, thefollowing implications emerge, none of which contradict Hydrick’s carefulreconstruction of Bormann’s and Müller’s escape, and which, moreover, broadlycorroborate it since the same methods are in play, and the same escape route isused:> 1) Consider first the matter of Eva Braun’s “overdose.” According to the> standard version of history, Eva Braun married Adolf Hitler in a small civil> ceremony in the bunker on April 30th, in the early hours of the morning. Some> twelve hours later, she allegedly bit into a cyanide capsule, committing> suicide. Hitler followed her by allegedly shooting himself in the temple, or,> depending on the version, in the mouth. The SS orderly who attended them was> ordered to wait ten minutes after he heard the pistol shot, then enter their> apartments. The bodies were to be removed and burned.> But according to Stalin’s firm conviction, Bormann escaped with two other men> and one woman, most likely, as we have seen, on the flight of Hanna Reitsch> and General Ritter Von Greim, from Berlin, on April 30th. Reitsch would> account for the woman (indeed, she had to be on the flight since only she> could pilot the plane out of Berlin, due to injuries Von Greim had suffered> during their flight into the city). Therefore, Eva Braun did not escape on the> April 30th flight, and according to Velasco’s account, did not escape at all.> Is there any way to corroborate this?> There is, though again, it is a speculative possibility based on combinations> of all the accounts – the standard history, the Hydrick scenario, and the> Velasco allegations. According to the standard version, Eva Braun, when she> began to sign her name to the marriage certificate, began to sign as Eva> Braun, but, as she did so, realized she was now Frau Hitler, and crossed her> maiden name out, and wrote Hitler instead. The standard history explains this> mistake as a normal human error.> But there is another possibility. If indeed Bormann had successfully> substituted a double for Hitler, and if he had no intention of rescuing Eva> Braun, then keeping her drugged throughout her last days in Berlin may have> been a necessity in order to perpetuate the fraud of the substitution of the> double. Moreover, the marriage itself between the double “Hitler” and Eva> Braun may have been concocted by Bormann himself as part of the cover story.> Under these circumstances, Eva Braun made her mistake signing the marriage> certificate not out of ordinary human error, but under the influence of drugs.> When one reads Velasco’s account, there hovers over it the dark possibility> that Eva Braun’s “overdose” was thus not accidental, but a deliberate> sacrifice of her on Bormann’s part to make the whole thing work, and to cut> down on the number of “unnecessary personnel” that he had to smuggle out of> Berlin.> 2) Consider secondly the implications of Velasco’s total account, for clearly> by the time Bormann has Hitler forcibly drugged, it is Bormann and not Hitler> who is calling the shots. In other words, under the pretence of acting out of> loyalty and friendship for the Führer and the wider Nazi cause, by drugging> Hitler and removing him from the bunker, Bormann has in effect staged a coup> d’etat.> There is another factor in Velasco’s account that reinforces this view, and> that is his insistence that Grand Admiral Dönitz was not only present in> Berlin but present in the bunker as this coup d’etat was being orchestrated> and Hitler was being removed on April 21, 1945. If Velasco’s account is true,> and if its implications as analyzed here are true, then the Admiral would> indeed have to be present in Berlin in order to work out the details of the> cover story and of Hitler’s transfer to Norway, since the Admiral would> ultimately be responsible for it. Such sensitive matters simply could not have> been trusted to telephone lines or radio communications, which would have been> capable of interception and decoding by the Allies. To make the scheme work,> nothing could be left to chance. Thus, this part of Velasco’s account –> regardless of its external corroboration by Sharkhunters founder Harry Cooper> – rings true on the basis of the internal logic of the situation.> Moreover, it sheds yet a new light on the shenanigans between Dönitz – loyal> to Hitler out of his sense of military duty and honor – and Bormann, not only> over the transfer of authority from Hitler to the Admiral, but over the> control of U-234, for these details might possibly have been agreed upon> between Bormann and the Grand Admiral during the latter’s visit to the bunker> on April 21! Thus, the whole strange struggle between the Bunker and Dönitz> for the control of U-234 as recounted in the previous chapter might have been> one vast charade to further confound any listening Allied ears. This too fits> the Bormann method of operation. Once the coup d’etat-by-drugs had been staged> on April 21st, Bormann could have a drugged Hitler – or his double for that> matter – sign any last political will and testament Bormann wished. It is in> this light that Velasco’s allegations of Bormann’s statements to him of his> reasons for forcibly removing Hitler from the bunker should be considered, for> Bormann merely needed Hitler alive as a symbol of the continuity of the cause,> and of the organization he was self-evidently putting into place and intending> to control himself.> In short, as far as Bormann was concerned, Hitler was expendable…but not just> yet.> 3) Finally, consider the implications of the escape route together with the> Hydrick scenario and the Police Gazette article. If Hitler had indeed been> smuggled to Norway, it would have been a comparatively simple matter to see to> it that he was embarked on the U-234 before the latter left Norway to return> to Germany to pick up Bormann and Müller. Naturally, Bormann would not have> informed his American partners that, in addition to uranium-235 and valuable> infrared proximity fuses on the submarine, that it also carried not only> himself and Müller, but Hitler himself! Thus, under the cover he knew the> Americans would give the U-234, he managed, if the above highly speculative> reconstruction be true, to smuggle not only himself and Müller to safety, but> the very personal symbol of Nazism itself: Adolf Hitler.Granted, while the above reconciliation of scenarios is highly speculative, itshould be noted that its truthfulness or lack thereof does not diminish theplausibility of Hydrick’s own scenario and the likelihood of Bormann’s andMüller’s escapes. That remains intact and stands on its own case, whether or notVelasco’s allegations are true.That being said, however, it is also evident that Velasco’s scenario is not onlyeasily reconciled in its main points with Hydrick’s reconstruction, butmoreover, corroborates Bormann’s and Müller’s methods of operation.2. Corroboration from Argentina So what of the end of this journey? Is there corroboration of the 1964 PoliceGazette article that Adolf Hitler was indeed somewhere in the environs ofBariloche, Argentina, and thus that Velasco’s allegations in their broadoutlines might, after all, be true?Indeed, and unfortunately, there is.Sharkhunters founder Harry Cooper led an expedition to a place he calls “Stadt,”in Argentina. Cooper deliberately does not say where this place is in order toprotect the innocent people involved. With his Argentine guide, he visited aplace called simply the Estancia, the “ranch,” a large compound. Contacting themanager of the ranch, Cooper recounts this story:> We were doing fine with the conversation until we told the manager that one of> our associates had spoken with a woman who had been the cook on the ‘Estancia’> many years ago, and she told us that she remembered very clearly cooking for> Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun when they were guests at the ‘Estancia’ in winter> (July, August, September of 1945…months after the reported suicide in Berlin.)> He looked at us with an empty stare. So we asked him point blank if he would> confirm the dates that Hitler was on the ‘Estancia’.> It would have been quite simple for him to take the easy route and merely tell> us that he was much too young and the war years were far earlier than he was> even born. Instead, he said:> “I am not allowed to speak about that.”15 Apart from the fact that the alleged presence of Eva Braun-Hitler at theEstancia conflicts with Velasco’s account, the broad corroboration of the PoliceGazette article now comes from a new anecdotal source: an Argentine ranchmanager who clearly knew something, but was under pressure not to talk about it.The question is, pressure from whom?But from the Police Gazette article we have learned something more: Hitler wassaid to be present somewhere within 100 miles or so of Bariloche.Do not forget that name, for if the corroboration seems a little thin now, thereare far more goings on in Bariloche than meet the eye, as will be seen in PartThree…1 Giordan Smith, Nexus March-April 2008, p. 41, emphasis added.2 Nexus, March-April 2008, p. 353 Ibid.4 Ibid.5 Nexus March-April 2008, p. 37.6 Trevor-Roper’s gullibility in this matter can hardly be emphasized too much,for on the face of it, does it seem reasonable that Adolf Hitler, busily running“his” war from his various headquarters with a micro-management style worthy ofa modern globalist corporation towards its employees, would have time to keep adiary!?7 Nexus, March-April 2008, p. 38.8 i.e, the Luftwaffe.9 Nexus, March-April 2008, p, 41, emphasis added.10 As of this writing, I have not been able to corroborate Smith’s assertionabout the fighter escort, though his actual numbers are not in dispute, as theLuftwaffe still had several operational Messerschmitt 262 jet fighters at itsdisposal. Getting that amount of fighters to assemble and be fueled and loadedfor escort operations at that late date in the war, however, would have beendifficult. Not impossible, but difficult.11 Don Angel Alcazar de Velasco, Escape from the Bunker, ed Harry Cooper, p. 24,emphasis added.12 Ibid., p. 28, bold and italicized emphasis added.13 Perhaps a reference to the attempt by Göring to seize power from Hitler, andto the secret attempts by Himmler to negotiate a surrender to the WesternAllies. For my rationalization of Himmler’s reasons for why he though he mighthave something to offer the western Allies, see my Reich of the Black Sun, p.156.14 Don Angel Alcazar de Velasco, Escape from the Bunker, p. 55, italicizedemphasis in the original, bold and italicized emphasis added.15 Harry Cooper, “Argentina’s Place in the War,” KTB #210: The Official HistoryPublication of the U-Bootwaffe, Volume 26 July 2008 Number 5, Sharkhunters, p.8, emphasis in the original."},{"pageContent":"image [images/00023.jpg] “The Rodents at the Other Endof the Ratlines:”Juan Domingo Perón andthe Vatican Connection > “Perón’s resounding triumph in the presidential elections of 24> February 1946 set the stage for the massive evacuation of Nazi fugitives> from Europe to Argentina.”> Uki Goñi1 The evidence hitherto presented indicates that the Nazis fleeing Europe for safehavens elsewhere, usually Latin America and the Middle East, did so viastopovers in Nationalist Spain. And given the massive size of Bormann’sstrategic evacuation plan, not only were massive amounts of liquid capital andassets to be transferred to safe neutral countries, but enormous technical data,personnel, and resources as well. Certainly the corporate connections availableto Bormann via his close relationship with I.G. Farben chief Hermann Schmitzwould give him enormous capabilities to create a tapestry of dummy corporationsand interlocking directorates to move the actual cash out of Europe. And withhis ability to control certain “black” U-boats directly, harder assets could besimilarly moved.But moving personnel and technical equipment, papers, and plans would requiresomething different.Bormann had to have help.This raises the all important and over-looked question of just who was at theother end of the ratlines smuggling Nazis out of Europe. Much, of course, hasbeen written of the Vatican’s role in these operations, and as will bediscovered here, it was in fact involved. Even then, however, fleeing Nazis hadto have someplace to go, especially if Bormann intended his Nazi Internationalto continue independent scientific research begun in the Third Reich, and totake a real though covert hand in postwar politics.This insight allows one to establish an inventory of what precise criteriaBormann’s Nazi International would need as a base of operations, given theintention to continue independent research, and given a presumptive intention toorchestrate economic and political events for an eventual recrudescence ofNazism. Bormann would need:> 1) A neutral country large enough and with enough “wilderness” or remote> areas, to safely house large amounts of people;> 2) Similarly, it must also be accessible;> 3) The government must be friendly to Nazism and amenable to a large Nazi> presence;> 4) The country must be technologically sophisticated enough to support> whatever scientific research projects the Nazi International wished to> accomplish, or able to import sophisticated equipment via German business> contacts when needed (see point 6 below);> 5) There must be sufficient territory within the country to hide such a> project, or at least keep it as far from public scrutiny as possible; thus, on> this view, even Nationalist Spain is out as is Sweden, Portugal, etc; in> short, a European base for the Nazi International, much less any research> project it may wish to continue, is out of the question;> 6) There must be sufficient German business penetration to permit the easy> transfer of funds into and out of Nazi accounts and also permitting the> liquidation of harder assets into liquid capital. And there is one more item to add to the list, given the Vatican’s well-knownparticipation in helping fleeing Nazis:> 7) It most likely will be a area with a predominantly Roman Catholic> population. When one considers this list, Latin America immediately offers itself as afulfillment of most of the criteria. However, the requirement of aNazi-sympathizing government narrows the list down substantially to Chile,Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and to some extent, Brazil. And of these five,there is one in particular that stands out, and that will increasingly do so asour analysis proceeds:Argentina.A. The Colonels, the Colonel, and the Beginning of a Courtship Argentine journalist and researcher Uki Goñi filled a much-needed gap in thegrowing literature concerning the Nazi ratlines with his book The Real ODESSA:How Perón Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina, for in it he tells thestory of the little known Argentine side of the ratlines, and of the crucialrole Argentine dictator Juan Domingo Perón played in ferrying Nazis to hiscountry and giving them asylum. Through careful sifting of the remainingdocuments concerning this activity in the Argentine national archives, Goñidemonstrates how the ratlines would not have been successful without theinvolvement of a major Latin American government with the resources to harborhundreds – if not thousands – of Nazis. In doing so, as we shall see, he alsodocuments how Bormann’s plans for ongoing Nazi research could not have beenaccomplished without the help of the Argentine dictator, even though Goñihimself does not adhere to the view that Bormann escaped from Berlin.2 While thecase for Bormann’s probable postwar involvement in an ongoing independent Naziresearch project is made in part three, examining Perón’s role in helping Nazisescape to Argentina will disclose the dictator’s own political motivation forthis nefarious activity, and why Perón would also have wished to sponsor Naziresearch in his country.1. Historical Backgrounda. Perón in Europe As Perón confided when he was dictating his memoirs during his exile toNationalist Spain between the end of his second presidency and his triumphantreturn to Argentina in the 1970s, he had serious “misgivings” about therightness of the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunals:> In Nuremberg at that time something was taking place that I personally> considered a disgrace and an unfortunate lesson for the future of humanity… I> became certain that the Argentine people also considered the Nuremberg process> a disgrace, unworthy of the victors, who behaved as if they hadn’t been> victorious. Now we realize that they (the Allies) deserved to lose the war.> During my government I often delivered speeches against Nuremberg, which is an> outrage history will not forgive!3 Whatever the legal and moral merits or lack thereof of the Nuremberg trials –consider only the presence of the representatives of Stalin’s regime as judgesat the affair – Perón’s attitude was obviously firmly maintained by him longafter his first two presidencies.Whenever and for whatever reasons Perón first developed his sympathies forNazism and the Third Reich, there can be no doubt that these crystallized whenthe young Perón, then an officer in the Argentine army, was sent on a tour ofEurope in 1938. Sent to tour various European countries as a military observer,Perón cultivated many contacts in Fascist Italy and Germany. According to Goñi,however, Perón was also present in Europe in 1942, receiving special militarytraining in Mussolini’s army. Goñi also indicates that Perón was granted anaudience with Pope Pius XII (Eugenio Pacelli), and that he met Argentine specialdiplomatic envoy Juan Carlos Goyeneche, who had been sent on a special missionto Berlin by then Argentine President Castillo.4b. Argentina and the Axis Castillo’s regime in Argentina began to court the Axis powers, and particularlyNazi Germany, during the “Axis high tide” of the summer of 1942, as Hitler’sarmies continued lunging deep into Soviet Russia and Rommel’s Afrika Korps racedacross the Libyan and Egyptian deserts. Castillo, “a weak civilian president,”walked a diplomatic tightrope, carefully maintaining “a façade of neutralitywhile his leading civilian and military advisors circumvented normal diplomaticchannels and sought direct contact with Berlin.”5In this case, the normal diplomatic channels were circumvented by a specialArgentine envoy, a young “Catholic nationalist” whose grandfather had once beenPresident of Uruguay, and “whose father had been mayor of Buenos Aires” prior tothe Second World War.6 The envoy’s name was Juan Carlos Goyeneche, and he was aclose friend and “confidential agent” of Colonel Juan Domingo Perón.Additionally, Goyeneche had cultivated close contacts among the foreignintelligence branch of the SS which had a heavy human on-the-ground presence inArgentina prior to and during the war.7 As Goñi observes, this network of agents“was connected to Berlin via an array of secret transmitters known as the‘Bolivar Network’ that covered much of the country.”8In 1942, Goyeneche departed for Europe via Nationalist Spain, whence he traveledonward to Fascist Italy. There, according to Goñi, using Argentine diplomaticcontacts in Spain, he was able to develop close ties to Giovanni CardinalMontini,9 at that time working in the Vatican Secretariat of State. Montini, ofcourse, will figure more prominently in the story in due course, but for now itsimply should be noted that it was Montini who would eventually be elected PopePaul VI and preside over the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council.1. The Argentine Special Envoy and Von Ribbentropp From Italy, Goyeneche eventually made his way to his ultimate destination,Berlin, in October of 1942. Once in Berlin,> He left immediately to visit Franco’s Blue Division on the Russian Front with> his old friend Gottfried Sandstede, the former press attaché at the German> embassy in Buenos Aires. Sandstede was a Schellenberg agent who had been> forced to abandon Argentina when his spying activities became too evident.10 Once Goyeneche and Sandstede returned to Berlin, Goyeneche was contacted bymembers of the Latin American bureau of the German Foreign Ministry, and ameeting was arranged between the special envoy and the German Foreign Minister,Joachim Von Ribbentropp.This meeting took place on November 30, 1942, at Von Ribbentropp’s estate inWestfalen, and according to Goñi, lasted several hours, with Gottfried Sandstedeacting as interpreter between Goyeneche and Von Ribbentropp.11 The purpose ofGoyeneche’s visit is illuminating, for he sought German assistance and support“for a nationalist candidate in the upcoming 1943 presidential elections…orfailing that, support for a coup that would maintain the ‘neutral’ Castillo inoffice.”12 Perón, in other words, was already beginning to plot, and looking toNazis for help.It is in Von Ribbentropp’s replies, however, that one can discern the exactbroad outlines of the Argentine-Nazi relationship beginning to develop. After alengthy anti-Jewish rant, the Foreign Minister> then proceeded to answer the three specific questions Goyeneche had regarding> Argentina: first, would Germany acquire Argentine products after the war? “If> Argentina maintains its present stand, she will profit from it greatly over> the countries which have not taken such a stand,” he answered. “We could take> everything that Argentina produced no matter how much it might be.”> Second, did Germany recognize Argentina’s rights over the Falklands? “England> is our enemy… Gibraltar is truly a grotesque example in this story, for> certainly nobody can question that it lies on the Iberian Peninsula. Likewise,> the Falklands are at least nearer Argentina than to England. Therefore, we> have great sympathy for the justifiable Argentine interest. But I believe that> unless Argentina takes care, it may be that the United States will take over> these islands.”> And third, did Hitler agree that Spain constituted the “natural bridge”> between Argentina and Europe? “The establishment of her cultural and spiritual> relationship with Europe is in the first rank of Argentine duties. We shall in> any case constantly promote the existing unity between Spain and Argentina.”13 Von Ribbentropp’s cagily diplomatic answers – and Goyeneche’s equally cageyquestions - must be viewed in the context of what had just occurred on theRussian Front, for the Soviets had just begun to launch the massivecounteroffensive at Stalingrad that would eventually lead to the decimation andsurrender of Von Paulus’ Sixth Army.In brief, Goyeneche, who had been sent to Berlin with the ostensible purpose ofnegotiating a secretive alliance with the Axis, was now faced with changedcircumstances, as were the Germans. We have already seen how top Nazi leadersbegan in the light of that looming disaster to make postwar plans. VonRibbentropp, if not at the very top, was close enough to it that he would haveknown of these plans and their implications for Nazi diplomacy.In that context, then, his answers to Goyeneche’s three questions deserve closerscrutiny. First, note that Von Ribbentropp states that Germany would certainlyneed Argentine products if Argentina maintained its “present stance,” i.e.,remained out of the war and ostensibly neutral. While the disaster at Stalingradhad not yet unfolded into its full horror, the threat clearly loomed, and VonRibbentropp knew it. He was quietly though emphatically telling Argentina tostay out of the war and remain neutral.The German Foreign Minister’s response to Goyeneche’s second question onlyreinforces this interpretation, for after expressing Nazi Germany’s sympathy forArgentine claims over the Falklands, he then states unequivocally that “Ibelieve that unless Argentina takes care, it may be that the United States willtake over these islands.” That is, if Argentina either entered the war overtlyas an Axis ally, or demonstrated too overt of a proAxis sympathy, Argentinamight be faced with a far graver threat than the United Kingdom, namely, theUnited States. This is the clearest possible indication not only that the GermanForeign Ministry wanted to keep Argentina out of the war, but was already layingthe diplomatic foundations for a postwar evacuation of Nazism to that country.This places Goyeneche’s third question and Von Ribbentropp’s response to it in anew light, for behind Goyeneche’s round-about question about German attitudestoward Nationalist Spain, he is really trying to make sure he has understood VonRibbentropp correctly. The question asked was “Does Germany view Spain as abridge between Europe and Argentina?” but the implied question was “Does Germanyintend to invade Spain?” Von Ribbentropp’s reply is equally diplomatic, butequally clear: “Germany respects Spain’s cultural ties to Argentina, andArgentina’s cultural ties to Europe via Spain,” in other words, “No, Germanywill not invade Spain, for it will be needed as a bridge between Europe andArgentina.” For Goyeneche, and ultimately for Goyeneche’s mentor and friend JuanPerón, the meaning was clear: the military situation was lost, and other planshad now to be put in place, and Spain was a key component of those plans.2. An Unusual Encounter Between Representatives of the SS andAllen Dulles But what of Goyeneche’s request to Von Ribbentropp for German support of a“nationalist candidate” in Argentina’s upcoming presidential election? Theanswer lies, perhaps, in Goyeneche’s next appointment in Berlin, for there hemet with none other than Walter Schellenberg, the notorious head of Himmler’sForeign Intelligence Service of the Sicherheitdienst. Schellenberg, a competentintelligence professional, had repeatedly warned the Nazi leadership that theUnited States’ enormous war production potential would eventually turn the waragainst the Reich. These warnings, unheeded, prompted Schellenberg to initiate aseries of private peace overtures to the Western Allies utilizing his largenetwork of spies and contacts. One of these overtures is worth mentioning, forit concerns none other than – once again – Allen Dulles, America’s OSS stationchief in Switzerland:> The most daring of these peace overtures took place in 1943 through> Schellenberg’s “special sources” Max Von Hohenlohe and Reinhard Spitzy,> representatives in Madrid of the Skoda arms firm. They held a number of> meetings in Berne with Allen Dulles, overseer of the American Office of> Strategic Services (OSS) in Europe. In the lengthy report drawn up by Spitzy> of these talks, the position taken by the American spy chief is> spine-chilling: “He (Dulles) was fed up with listening all the time to> outdated politicians, émigrés and prejudiced Jews. In his view a peace had to> be made in Europe… while he had scant sympathy for Soviet Russia, he did not> reject National Socialism in its basic ideas and deeds… he added that it would> be unbearable for any decent European to think that the Jews might return> someday.” Interestingly enough, Spitzy was also one of Schellenberg’s> “channels” for information about Argentina, one that bypassed the normal> intelligence chain. Only a few months after the Dulles talks, Spitzy would be> attempting to negotiate a secret arms deal with one of Perón’s colonels in> Madrid with Schellenberg’s support.14 There are a number of speculative implications to unpack here, and it is best todo so before proceeding.First, note that Schellenberg’s contacts with Dulles are representatives of theSkoda munitions works in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia. Skoda’s engineering divisionwas, of course, the front for SS Obergruppenführer Hans Kammler’s secret weaponsthink tank. Consequently, it is possible that Dulles, via these contacts,learned something about the Kammler Group from these individuals, thoughcertainly he would have only seen the tip of the iceberg. The reason that thispossibility must be entertained is because, as I pointed out in my book Reich ofthe Black Sun, General Patton’s U.S. Third Army thrusts at the end of the war,if compared to the known headquarters and installations of Kammler’s secretweapons “think tank,” appear to have been guided unerringly to many of them. AsI indicated there, this would imply that at some extraordinarily high level, theThird Army was being ultimately guided by an intelligence agenda.15 This meetingmay be yet another small clue that this possibility was indeed the case.Secondly, note Dulles’ response to this overture as recounted by Spitzy himself.In all fairness to Dulles, it may be that his response was designed to let theGerman “hear what they wanted to hear,” but Dulles did send out private feelersand attempt to persuade the American leadership that a separate peace mightactually be desirable. But if his response represents a genuine and heartfeltconviction on his part, then his subsequent dealings with German militaryintelligence chief Reinhard Gehlen, not to mention his statement to Paul Manningthat he was “on the right track,” take on a more sinister significance. The factthat Schellenberg’s agents deliberately sought Dulles out suggests that Dulles’character and sympathies were well known to Schellenberg.Finally, note that Spitzy is in turn involved in negotiating an arms deal forone of Perón’s agents in Madrid. This implies that Goyeneche’s question aboutGerman support for a “suitable” candidate in Argentina’s upcoming presidentialelections had met with a favorable response, for Germany was prepared to armPerón’s associates in case the necessity for a coup presented itself.3. The Colonels’ Coup In early January, 1943, as the Germans’ military situation at Stalingrad wasreaching its disastrous denouement, Goyeneche visited Heinrich Himmler at thelatter’s eastern front headquarters. The conversation was of a general nature,though Himmler asked Goyeneche to convey a favorable impression of theReichsführer to Pius XII on the latter’s upcoming visit to Rome.16 From Berlin,Goyeneche returned once more to Madrid, where he lunched with Spain’s foreignminister, Ramón Serrano Suñer, discussing his impeding visit to Pope Pius XIIand Benito Mussolini. Goñi reveals more about the Argentine special envoy’spurpose, for he> was organizing a conference of pro-Axis Catholic delegates from Vichy France,> Hungary, Romania, Slovenia, Italy, Spain and Portugal, who would meet in Rome> to integrate the Christian order in the New Order. 17 Journeying on to Rome, Goyeneche met twice with Giovanni Cardinal Montini, andthen with Pope Pius XII who urged Argentina to preserve its neutrality. The Popewent so far as to draft a message in support of Argentina’s neutrality.18 Afterthis, the special envoy met with Benito Mussolini, who communicated FascistItaly’s secret support for a coup.19On June 4, 1943, all these maneuverings on the part of Perónist Goyeneche, theAxis, and the Vatican, were finally rewarded when a group of colonels led byPerón finally overthrew Castillo, ejecting him from the presidential mansion,the Casa Rosada.However, it is worth noting, the outlines of the postwar Nazi International thatbegan to take shape during this time period, when the military initiative passedirrevocably from the Axis to the Allies in the wake of the disaster atStalingrad and the British victory at El Alamein in North Africa.As was seen above, the most likely initial purpose of Goyeneche’s visit toGermany in 1942-1943 was to solicit German support for just such a coup, andfurther, to enter a secretive alliance with the Axis powers. Dissuaded in thiscourse by Ribbentropp’s diplomatic answers, the next best thing was concluded:the installation of a pro-Axis “neutral” regime in Buenos Aires. Moreimportantly, as Goñi’s account reveals, the Argentine effort was fully complicitin the attempt to “internationalize” Nazism by linking to the various pro-Nazifactions in the various puppet governments of Europe, and this effort centeredfurthermore on tacit Vatican support. This “internationalizing” of Nazism arounda German core was already hinted at by Wilhelm Landig in his science fictionnovels, which, once again, appear indeed to be “full of realities.”Once Perón’s colonels were in power, moreover, secret collaboration began inearnest:> A partnership with Argentina’s military had already been formalized. As he> told American interrogators after the war, SD chief Walter Schellenberg had> approved “an agreement for mutual collaboration” in May 1943. It included> freedom from arrest for Nazi agents in Argentina, camouflage identification> for them as members of the Argentine secret service, the use of the Argentine> diplomatic pouch for transporting “secret material” between Buenos Aires and> Berlin, and even an early warning system in case of a “cabinet crisis” that> could endanger German agents. In return, Argentina’s military were allowed> access to the powerful radio communications network of the Nazi secret> service, were provided with information culled from Nazi sources in> Argentina’s neighboring countries and were promised collaboration in forming> an Argentine-led South American bloc of nations.20 Another avenue for items out of Europe to Argentina thus emerges, for under thecloak of Argentina’s diplomatic pouch, and as a component of his strategicevacuation plan, Bormann could smuggle almost anything out of the collapsingReich, especially sensitive documents, files, and blueprints. Additionally, withthe suggestion of Nazi collaboration to assist Argentina in forming a “bloc ofnations,” another component of the Nazi International emerges, one which will bedeveloped later in this chapter and in part two: the creation of a “ThirdPosition” between the two likely postwar power centers of the United States andthe Soviet Union.4. Perón’s “Third Position”: Its International GeopoliticalImplications Indeed, Juan Perón began discussing the idea of what he called a “ThirdPosition” between the far right’s capitalism, and the far left’s Communism, withhis future foreign minister as early as 1947. So committed to this vision wasPerón that he and his intelligence chief Rodolfo Freude invited the pro-Nazisympathizer and Belgian “Rexist”21 Daye to meet with Perón personally after thelatter had overtly assumed power in Argentina. Both Perón and Freude wereimpressed with Daye’s own attempts to cultivate such political views among hisown contacts in Argentina and Europe,> and were particularly interested in (Daye’s) group’s objective of creating “a> movement to unite all those in the world who do not support either of the two> formulas offered to the masses: American democratic capitalism, which declares> itself the champion of freedom and the defender of private property, and> Bolshevik Russian Communism, the destroyer of private capitalism but also the> destroyer of all individual freedom.”22 As will be seen in part two, this is a view with powerful geopoliticalimplications, for it will be found in many other instances in the postwar worldwhere there was a palpable Nazi influence on various governments and politicalmovements.5. The Argentine Declaration of War on Germany, and Perón’sHidden Purpose Allied pressure on Argentina to enter the war on the Allied side continued, andincreased, from 1942 onward, and particularly so after the Colonels’ Coup of1943. Finally, in March 1945, Argentina “relented” to pressure and declared waron Germany, a little over a month before Germany’s two surrenders on May 7 andMay 8, 1945. But as Perón admitted later,> This false declaration of war had a clear purpose: “We hadn’t lost contact> with Germany, despite the break in diplomatic relations,” Perón would say in> 1967. “Things being so we received an ususual request. Even though it may seem> contradictory at first, Germany benefits from our declaration of war: if> Argentina becomes a belligerent country, it has the right to enter Germany> when the end arrives; this means that our planes and ships would be in a> position to render a great service. At that point we had the commercial planes> of the FAMA line (Argentine Merchant Air Fleet) and the ships we had bought> from Italy during the war. That is how a great number of people were able to> come to Argentina.”23 With Argentina’s declaration of “war,” a declaration that reveals Perón’s veryeasy redefinition of war itself, Argentina’s role in the Nazi ratlines wassecure, as was Perón’s own plans for it.Bormann must have been delighted.Nor is this a glib nor offhand comment, for it provides yet another possibleroute and alternative to the Hydrick scenario, for Argentine planes and shipscould enter not only any Nazi occupied territory – such as Norway – withimpunity, or Nazi-friendly Nationalist Spain, but under the Argentine flag,ferry Nazis and anything they wished under the security of being allied to theUnited States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union! Argentina’s prospective roleas a laundering point for Nazi treasure and a safe-haven for fleeing Nazis andtheir puppet allies, hinted at in the conversations between Goyeneche and VonRibbentropp, was now about to pay both Juan Perón and the Nazi International,and Martin Bormann himself, big dividends.24B. The Ratlines and Argentina’s Role1. The Ustashi-Vatican Dress Rehearsal The “dress rehearsal” for Perón’s end of the ratlines and his clout with theVatican is evident in the fact that, in 1946, Perón and Giovanni CardinalMontini began secret negotiations to form a ratline for fleeing Italians andother groups,25 the most notorious of which was the Nazi puppet Ustashi regimeof Croatia. After the German invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, the Third Reichcarved Croatia out of the country and installed a Nazi friendly government.> If the German Nazis with their godless ideology and their gas chambers> industrialized the business of genocide, the wartime Ustasha regime in Croatia> was led by deeply Catholic men who employed medieval methods to conduct their> programme of extermination. Mass shootings, clubbing and decapitation were the> methods by which they pursued their aim of a racially pure and 100 per cent> Catholic state. By the end of the war some 700,000 people had perished in the> Ustasha death camps at Jasenovac and elsewhere. The regime’s fury was directed> primarily against the Orthodox Serb population, but Jews and Gypsies were also> included in the death roll.26 The leader of this monstrous state was Ante Pavelic, “the Poglavnik, or Führer,of an independent Croatia.”27 While the Vatican danced around the genocide inNazi Germany, “the Roman Catholic Church in Croatia became an ardent supporterof Pavelic’s crimes,”28 which included a race law promulgated in Zagreb thatrequired not only that Jews wear an armband with the Star of David, but thatOrthodox Serbs wear a blue armband designating them as Eastern OrthodoxCatholic, rather than Roman Catholic, Christians.29The degree and ferocity of the Ustashi regime’s atrocities appalled even theNazis!> By August 1941, the office of General Edmund Glaise von Hortenau, the German> army representative in Croatia, reported to Berlin that 200,000 Serbs had> “fallen as victims of animal instincts whipped up by Ustasha leaders.”> On 17 February 1942 Himmler received a detailed report on the “atrocities> carried out by Ustasha units in Croatia against the Orthodox population.” His> agents told Himmler that the Ustashi committed their deeds “in a bestial> manner not only against males of conscript age but especially against helpless> old people, women and children. The number of the Orthodox that the Croatians> have massacred and sadistically tortured to death is about 300,000.”30 Of course, the Nazi horror at all this carnage was hardly altruistic, as theirconcerns were more to maintain good relations with their Allies Romania andBulgaria, both predominantly Orthodox countries.Whatever Nazi Germany’s real motivations were, it nonetheless demanded thatPavelic remove the most brutal of these executioners from office, and there isevidence that suggests that the first ratlines from Europe to Argentina began asa result of this governmental crisis in Zagreb, since Pavelic utilized hisfriendship with Perón to purchase Argentine passports for his henchmen.31 As thewar drew near its inevitable end, Pavelic transferred enormous sums to theVatican and Switzerland for safe-keeping, to fund his Ustashi regime in exile inthe pro-Nazi, and definitely Catholic, Argentina.32 Aiding and abetting thistransfer of plundered Usashi treasure and murderers was Bishop Alois Hudal,longtime supporter of Pavelic’s regime, who was also involved on the Vatican endof smuggling Nazis to Argentina as well.332. The Three Argentine Ratline Routes Direct German support for Perón finally came, strangely enough – or perhaps notso strangely after all, given all that has been reviewed thus far – after thewar’s end, in 1945-46, when Rodolfo Freude’s father Ludwig, “a long-timepersonal friend of Perón with proven Nazi links, had channeled largecontributions from Argentina’s German business community into Perón’s 1945-1946presidential campaign, seeming to confirm the rumours that the colonel was inthe pay of the Nazis.”34 By now it should be evident that when one says “Germanbusiness interests” at this period of history, one says “Bormann” as well. EvenGoñi, who as was seen does not subscribe to the theory of Bormann’s postwarsurvival and presence in Argentina, had to mention that an Americancounterintelligence report from the period stated that “Ludwig Freude was‘financing Nazi resistance throughout the world.’” Moreover, notes Goñi,“rumours abounded that Hitler’s deputy Martin Bormann was in hiding in Argentinaand working with Freude.”35So close was the relationship between Perón and his spy-master Fredue that, whena momentary coup against Perón’s puppet Edelmiro Farrell – no relation! – landedVice President Perón in jail, it was Rodolfo Freude, and a convenient uprisingof Perón supporters, that toppled the coup and propelled Perón to his 1946election victory.36Once in full power, Perón established three separate routes for his ratlines:> 1) the northern route via Denmark, Sweden, and Norway;37> 2) the Swiss route through Switzerland, a route no doubt effected by the> personal visit of Evita Perón to Madrid, where she may have had contact with> SS Colonel Otto Skorzeny;38 and,> 3) the southern route, via ships departed from Genoa, Italy, with Vatican> diplomatic passports and false identities provided by the Archbishop of Genoa,> Giuseppi Cardinal Siri.39 Perón’s own objective in creating these ratlines was to recruit technicians forhis ambitious program of aeronautics and the development of modern jet fightersfor Argentina’s air force. Indeed, some of his first recruits were the brilliantpro-Nazi French jet designer Emile Dewoitine and Germany’s equally capable KurtTank, an engineer for Focke-Wulfe, whom we will encounter briefly again in partthree.3. Bormann and Perón’s Joint Bank Accounts and TheirImplications Hovering over all this activity is, of course, the shadow of Martin Bormann, andthe possibility that he did escape, along with his plunder, from Europe.But is there any evidence that this in fact occurred?Oddly enough, there is, and it comes from a rare postwar document of Argentina’sCentral de Intelligencia. It is a bank account statement of a joint account heldby Perón and Bormann, listed by national currencies.image [images/00024.jpg] Bormann’s and Perón’s Joint Bank Account Statement Just what Bormann and Perón did with all this money – an enormous sum ofdollars, Swiss, Belgian, and French francs, Dutch florins, and several kilogramsof gold, platinum, and diamonds – will be suggested in part three.With this review, however, we have concluded our survey of the background of theNazi International. It is time, then, to see what their actual postwar politicalplans and activities were.1 Uki Goñi, The Real ODESSA: How Perón Brought the Nazi War Criminals toArgentina, Revised Edition (London: Granta Books, 2002), p. 108.2 Goñi, The Real ODESSA, p. xxi.3 Cited in Goñi, The Real ODDESSA, p. 100.4 Ibid., p. 3.5 Goñi, The Real ODESSA, p. 2.6 Ibid.7 Ibid., p. 3.8 Ibid.9 Ibid.10 Goñi, The Read ODESSA, p. 7.

After a zig-zag coursefrom Rome to Bahrain, Dubai, and so on, the hijackers eventually put the planedown in Mogadishu, Somalia. The hijackers were demanding the release of membersof the Red Army Faction, another terrorist group, being held in West Germanprisons, and fifteen million American dollars. After the hijackers shot theGerman pilot in the head in front of the 86 passengers and threatened to blow upthe plane if their demands were not met, things really began to go wrong……for the hijackers.Unbeknownst to them, West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt had secretlyauthorized West Germany’s elite commando unit, the GSG-9, in conjunction withBritain’s SAS, to storm the plane in Mogadishu, and take out the hijackers. Thisthey did with customary German efficiency, leaving three of the four hijackersdead, the other one in custody, and only one injury to a passenger and a flightcrew member. Germany’s message was clear: Mess with us, and we will hunt youdown, wherever you are, and kill you. Chancellor Schmidt was widely praised inthe German and world media for his decision and his government’s stance.But what people neglected to notice were the implications of the event:Germany had deployed an elite military commando team outside of Germany, over athousand miles away, on a moment’s notice, executed a nearly flawless militaryoperation in conjunction with the British, and it was all over almost before thehijackers had even known it was happening. It was the first time since World WarTwo that Germany had deployed any unit of its military outside its borders inactive combat operations. It was also the first, but definitely not the last,time Germany would deploy its elite and highly secretive GSG-9 unit to rescue adelicate situation. And it demonstrated Germany’s ability, and willingness, toproject coordinated and deadly force at significant distances from her borders.A. Nazi Germany’s Penetration of the Muslim World The incident was ironic in another sense, for it was one and the same Germanythat had helped spawn and train so many of the nascent Muslim terrorist groupsto begin with:> The genesis of the cooperation between militant Islam and the extreme right> can be traced back to the early years of the Third Reich. During World War II,> much of the Islamic world sympathized with the Axis alliance. Members of the> Muslim Brotherhood would often say prayers for an Axis victory during their> meetings. Moveover, some Muslims went so far as to fantasize over putative> Islamic affinities of fascist leaders. For example, rumors abounded that> Benito Mussolini was an Egyptian Muslim whose real name was Musa Nilil (Moses> of the Nile) and that Adolf Hitler too had secretly converted to Islam and> bore the name Hayder, or “the brave one.”2 Not withstanding these Muslim fantasies, Nazi Germany was initially slow torespond to Arab world entreaties.After the promulgation of the Nuremberg Race Laws in 1936 which denied Germancitizenship status to Jews, the Nazi Reich received telegrams of support fromthroughout the Muslim world. The Third Reich’s interest in the Muslim world,however, would not begin until 1937 “with the publication of a report by theBritish Royal Commission, which explicitly recommended for the first time thepartition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states.”3 This prompted theGerman Foreign Ministry, which feared a Jewish state could become a base ofoperation for “international Jewry” along a similar basis as the Vatican CityState, to examine ways of increasing support for the purpose of strengtheningthe Muslim world “as a counterweight against such a possible increase in powerfor world Jewry.”4 These methods included overt diplomatic overtures to morecovert support for radical Islamic groups. Attention was paid to three countriesin particular on the peripheries of the British Empire, strategically positionedto threaten sensitive British interests: Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan.1. Iraq In some respects, Iraq constitutes the significant exception to the abovepattern, for as I wrote in a previous book, The Cosmic War, German interest inthe country began long before the Nazi Party took power. It is worth recountingwhat I said in that book here, in the new context of an examination of Nazigeopolitics in the Arab world:> Nazi interest in that country, then under strong British influence, dates back> to the 1920s when the National Socialist party was still in its infancy. Not> surprisingly, one finds the character of Detlef Schmude - a main player in the> Nazi party’s secret society backer, the infamous Thule Gesellschaft, a member> as well in Von Liebenfels’ Order of the New Templars (ONT) and an editor of> the Thule Society’s magazine Ostara – settling in Tabriz, in neighboring> Persia. There he based his next few years’ search for the “Hidden Masters.”> Someone of Schmude’s importance and position within these groups suggests that> he was the point man for gathering facts and information for them.> Then, in 1939 Admiral Wilhelm Canaris’ Abwehrabteilung, Germany’s military> intelligence, dispatched Dr. Paul Leverkühn to the Middle East to cultivate> allies among the Muslim populations under British rule or influence. His> headquarters was also Tabriz, in Persia. But most interestingly, his most> highly-placed recruit was none other than pro-Nazi Iraqi Prime Minister Rashid> Ali, overthrown two years later by the British invasion of Iraq.> Canaris’ network of Abwehr agents inside of Iraq was taken over by Himmler in> 1944, after Canaris’ implication in the Bomb Plot against Hitler in July of> that year. Strangely enough, Himmler placed these agents under the control of> none other than Baron Rudolf Von Sebottendorff, one of the principal founders> of the Thule Gesellschaft to begin with and, like Schmude, a member of Von> Liebenfels’ Order of the New Templars! This implies that the real basis of> Nazi networks in Iraq was grounded in the secret society network in the> region, perhaps initiated by Schmude.> Yet another connection that must be mentioned is “Himmler’s Rasputin,” Karl> Maria Willigut, a.k.a. Weisthor. In 1940 Willigut brought several> archaeological discoveries that indicated man’s presence in Iraq’s Irbil> province as far back as 10,000 B.C.> What happened to this Thule-SS network in Iraq after 1945 no one knows,> however, it is interesting to note that Von Sebottendorff’s body was found> floating in the Bosporus in Istanbul in 1945, after the war’s end.5 As indicated, Nazi interest in Iraq stemmed in part from the covert and hiddenoccult influences at work in the secret societies that midwifed the Nazi Partyinto existence, influences that later extended into the upper echelons ofHimmler’s SS.But here it is important to note the political aspect of German involvement, forwith German support, Rashid Ali staged his now famous coup. It was an act thatdirectly threatened Britain’s oil lifeline. Britain had to respond, and did sowith an invasion that topped the regime. The British invasion did not, however,succeed in rolling up the Nazi espionage network, for that was based in Iran, aswas seen.The Iraqi coup was aided by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who in 1939 was inBaghdad, meeting with the Committee of Free Arabs. There he discussed the plansfor the coup with the group of colonels leading the committee. The Mufti was atit again in 1940 when he was in Berlin, signing an “Axis-Arab Manifesto ofLiberation,” in which both Fascist dictators expressed their “strong support foran independent, united Arab nation.”6 What emerges from this is a pattern ofNazi and German support for and exploitation of Arab and Muslim aspirationsagainst the “imperialism of oil,” i.e., Britain and the United States. It is apattern to pay attention to, for it will figure prominently not only in thepolicies and agenda of the postwar Nazi International but to a certain extent inthe geopolitics of West Germany as well.2. Iran Iran played its own peculiar role in Nazi-Muslim contacts. In Persia, anationalist general, Shah Reza Pahlavi, “who seized power in 1925, was anadmirer of Adolf Hitler’s racial policies and even went so far as to rename hiscountry Iran, which translates into Aryan in Persian.”7 During the Shah’s reignuntil overthrown by British and American troops in 1941,8 the Grand Mufti ofJerusalem briefly took refuge in the country, as will be seen below.3. Afghanistan Afghanistan was another country to which Nazi Germany made serious diplomaticadvances throughout the 1930s. These, as elsewhere in the Muslim world, weresuccessful and Germany succeeded in establishing very cordial relations with theAfghani government. So good were relations that the Nazis “even attempted toestablish a political alliance with Mullah Mirza Ali Khan, who, along with hisWaziri mujahedeen, resisted British rule of the Northwestern Province ofAfghanistan from 1937 to 1947.”9 Nazi envoys successfully contacted Islamicguerillas in the British zone of Sarhad, bringing with them “a letter of supportfrom Adolf Hitler.”10 This time, however, the embassy was ambushed by theBritish and Afghani border police. The king, whatever his pro-Nazi sympathiesmight have been, was well aware of what had happened to Iraq and Iran, anddecided to expel all German and Italian diplomats from his country.11B. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Al Husseini, and Nazism As has been seen, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin Al-Husseini, played aprominent role in Nazi plans for the region. Having signed the Axis-ArabManifesto of Liberation in Berlin in 1940, the Grand Mufti once again made hisway back to the Middle East, first headquarting himself in Baghdad until theBritish coup overthrew the pro-Nazi government, forcing Al-Husseini to flee toNazi-friendly Iran, until again forced to flee by the arrival of British andAmerican troops and the installation of a pro-Allied puppet government inTehran. Al-Husseini made his way back to the one country and city in which heknew he would be welcome, and where he would remain until the war’s end: NaziGermany, and Berlin. There, among other “activities” in aid of the Nazi-radicalMuslim cause, he helped form the Arab League in 1944.12 But his other“activities” are worth mentioning in their own right.According to researcher George Michael, the Grand Mufti has his own hands bloodyin the Holocaust, for he played a significant role in discouraging the Naziregime and the pro-Nazi governments of Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, fromallowing Jewish emigration to Palestine.13 More importantly, Al-Husseini, whilestill resident in Jerusalem, received a special envoy from Nazi Germany in 1937,one of whose members was Adolf Eichmann. The purpose of the special embassy toAl-Husseini was to discuss the possibility of Jewish emigration to Palestine.Husseini, of course, discouraged this.141. Hitler and Husseini at Tea According to Michael, however, Husseini’s access to the Nazi regime while he wasin Berlin may have been so extensive that he even knew Hitler personally.Michael, whose research contacts included one Ahmed Huber, “a Swiss nationaldepicted as a liaison between the contemporary extreme right and militantIslam,”15 relates the following account of a meeting between Hitler and theGrand Mufti that Huber alleged took place between the two leaders. According toHuber, the Grand Mufti told him of many meetings with Hitler:> He told me a fantastic story. On one night in December 1941, after the big> victories of Germany over the Soviet Union, he had a long talk with Hitler> about architecture, culture, the music of Richard Wagner, and so on. Hitler> started talking about race theory and anti-Semitism and the Grand Mufti asked> Hitler, “Did you ever think, Mr. Chancellor, that your race theory comes out> of Judaism? It comes out of the Old Testament.” And Hitler was very astonished> by that. The Grand Mufti knew the Bible very well. He said, “All your ideas,> the doctrine of the Nazi Party are in the Old Testament. The chosen people of> God are not the chosen people, but the chosen race and that blood carries the> soul. And this chosen race must keep its blood pure. It must not mix its blood> with non-Jews; the foreigners, the subhuman beasts called the goyim, are> inferior to the Jewish master race. The genocide order of God in the fifth> book of Moses and in the book of Joshua. The race laws of Ezra and Ishmael.> All of these things are in the Old Testament.” Hitler was absolutely> astonished and the Mufti told him (further), “You have not high esteem for the> Africans, for Black people. And also this comes from the Old Testament in the> first book of Moses, the Black race is doomed, considered by God to eternal> slavery. It’s the famous curse by God on Ham, one of the three sons of the> prophet Noah.”16 Besides giving Hitler Bible lessons on the mediaeval barbarism of the OldTestament parallels to his racial policies, the Mufti was also giving morematerial assistance to the Nazi cause as well.2. The First Suicide Squads and the Muslim Waffen SS Among the more active material assistance the Grand Mufti gave to Hitler was hisactive recruitment among Bosnian Muslims for volunteer soldiers for the MuslimWaffen SS Handschar division.17 Husseini also made pro-Axis broadcasts to theArab world from Nazi Germany, and wrote a book, Islam and the Jews, a“motivational” treatise designed to incite Muslim hatred of Jews – and, as itturned out, Orthodox Christian Serbs – and motivate Muslim volunteers to assistin the Nazi slaughter.18 For his efforts, the Nazi regime made him the SupremeSheikh-ul Islam, the supreme “chaplain” for Nazi Germany’s Waffen-SS Muslimlegions.19 If the Nazi regime’s evaluation is any indicator, Al-Husseini was adefinite asset to “the cause.”Indeed, in one sense, the Grand Mufti succeeded in opening the floodgates ofMuslim manpower to the Axis, for as late as 1945 units of volunteer Muslims wereraised from Chechnya and other regions far behind the front lines in the SovietUnion, and were “organized into nineteen independent Islamic combat battalionsand twenty-four infantry companies in the Wehrmacht.” Furthermore, Muslim Turksand Tartars were organized into “a Waffen-SS division known as the OsturkischesWaffenverband (East Turkish Armed League) and SS-Waffengruppe ‘Turkestan’ (SSArmed Turkestan Group).”20 Some of these units operated behind Soviet lines asanti-Communist partisan groups, while several Muslim units participated incrushing the Jewish uprising in the Warsaw ghetto.21The Grand Mufti certainly delivered not only manpower but experience for suchactivities, for he is also credited for helping to organize long before the war“the first modern fedayeen … suicide squads, which primarily targeted moderateArabs who refused to support his agenda.”223. Cousin Yasser Arafat Not surprisingly, then, the Grand Mufti appears to have figured in the Nazis’postwar calculations. Remaining in Germany until just three days before Hitler’salleged suicide, the SS contacted the Mufti and offered him an airplane by whichto escape from Switzerland. Al-Husseini refused, apparently preferring to makehis way to the neutral country by means of a car which he had purchased for thepurpose. The SS hoped that Al-Husseini “would eventually make his way to NorthAfrica, where he had established spy networks that were still extant.”23 Inpoint of fact, the Grand Mufti did indeed eventually end up in Egypt, where hehad a great influence on emerging Arab leaders, and no doubt also helpedorganize radical Islamic guerilla and suicide units, for among those heinfluenced was his distant cousin, Yasser Arafat, founder of the PalestineLiberation Organization. Additionally, there is evidence that the Mufti also wasdirectly involved in the organization of Fatah, the PLO’s militant and terroristarm.24Just how Al-Husseini was able to do all this without significant financialsupport is a moot point, for as has been seen, Bormann’s emerging NaziInternational not only had money, but had lots of it. The fact that Al-Husseiniwas offered direct SS assistance as the Reich collapsed - and with the madscramble of Nazis trying to flee the country and acquire their own vehicles andairplanes, already in scarce supply - is an indicator of just how highly rankedin the scheme of Nazi priorities for the postwar world he really was. Needlessto say, the Mufti also helped organize ratlines for Nazis who fled to the MiddleEast, with significant postwar repercussions as will be seen momentarily.25C. The “Third Position” and the Egyptian Venture: Skorzeny, Schacht, Voss, andNasser All this is a powerful indicator that behind the crescent of radical Islam inthe postwar world there might loom an even more sinister symbol of terror andmurder, the swastika. But this presence is more than mere conjecture based uponprobable shadowy connections between the Nazi International and Al-Husseini.Nazi participation was sought by postwar Arab leaders, was given by the Nazisthemselves, and often with the quiet but very direct support of the West Germangovernment itself.Egypt’s postwar leaders and their collaboration with well-known postwar Nazis isa significant case in point, and in it, one may see the outlines of the NaziInternational’s postwar policies and politics at work. Egypt was, in fact, theone country that perhaps was the most deeply influenced by the Nazi regime,26for as Field Marshal Rommel’s Afrika Korps drove ever deeper and closer toAlexandria and Cairo in early 1942, Egyptian Arab sympathies for an Axis victorywere often openly expressed in British occupied Egypt. Even King Farouk wassupportive of the Nazi cause in spite of his rule being propped up by theBritish.Even with the war’s end, “populist” Egyptian anti-Western sentiment againstFarouk’s rule had grown to such an extent that “both the U.S. and Britishgovernments decided that Farouk had to be replaced.”27 At this juncture, eventsonce again took a very strange turn:> The CIA, under the influence of John Foster Dulles, selected Egyptian general> Muhammad Naguib to lead a new Egyptian government. One July 22, 1952, with the> help of the CIA, Naguib sent the army into the streets of Cairo and Alexandria> and established himself as the commender in chief of military forces. Although> Naguib was the titular head of state, unbeknown to the CIA, the real power> ultimately rested with Lieutenant Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, who soon assumed> the position of president. This coup was also significant because it opened> the door for numerous Nazis to take prominent positions in the Egyptian> government.28 This calls for some commentary.As is known by now, the reality of the CIA’s “Soviet Desk” at that period ofhistory was that it was being run on a practical level and in terms of its humanon-the-ground assets in Eastern Europe by a group of Nazis, still under thecommand of the wartime general in charge of German military intelligence on theEastern Front, Reinhard Gehlen. Gehlen had negotiated this arrangement with noneother than John Foster Dulles’ brother, Allen Dulles. Thus, one may reasonablyconjecture that behind the American support for the coup against King Faroukthere lurks probable consultation between the two Dulles brothers - John Foster,at the time President Eisenhower’s Secretary of State, and Allen, over at theCIA – in who best to lead it.But it has often been pointed out that the value of Gehlen’s intelligenceregarding foreign attitudes and intentions toward the U.S.A. was often speciousat best, for Gehlen’s intentional overestimation of Soviet military capabilitiesand intentions played no small part in the spread and enduring intensity of theearly Cold War. Little has been said, however, on why Gehlen might havedeliberately wished to influence postwar American military and geopoliticalpolicy by such overestimations. But it does make sense in the light of apresumptive postwar Nazi intention to exacerbate postwar East-West tensions inorder to play one side off against the other, enhancing Germany’s position inthe process, and exploiting conflicts in other nations that such tensions wouldinevitably create. More on this in the next chapter.Such appears to be the case in respect to the days immediately followingNasser’s CIA-sponsored coup, for suddenly, America’s interests seemed to falloff Nasser’s radar screen, only to be replaced by someone else’s. George Michaelnotes that “not long after the war, many German military officers and Nazi partyofficials were granted sanctuary in Middle Eastern countries, most notably Egyptand Syria, where they helped develop the militaries and intelligences agenciesof those countries.”29 One of these officers who found sanctuary in Egypt wasthe unrepentantly Nazi general, Otto Remer.30 Remer’s presence is significant,for not only was he the founder of the thinly-disguised neo-Nazi Socialist ReichParty in postwar West Germany, he was also the very general who crushed the coupattempt against Adolf Hitler in July of 1944 by maintaining Nazi control overthe military units in Berlin.It was with General Remer’s help – and that of former SS commando Otto Skorzeny– that Nasser developed an Egyptian support base for anti-western guerillas inTunisia, Morocco, and Algeria as well as for insurgencies in Aden and Kenya.31In other words, one postwar policy and agenda of the Nazi International is nowin full view: the exploitation of anti-imperialist and nationalist insurgenciesin the colonial empires of France and Britian. General Remer was the contactpoint between Nasser’s Egypt and these guerillas, for he arranged thetrafficking of arms and training – often with former Muslim and German SSveterans – for these guerilla movements.321. Wilhelm Voss and Otto Skorzeny in Gamal Abdul Nasser’s Egypt Skorzeny himself had arrived in Egypt in the early 1950s to lend his militaryexpertise in the training of the Egyptian Army and Muslim and other“anti-imperialist” guerilla units. There he quickly formed a triumvirate withNasser and the Grand Mufti in order to further their mutual goals.33 Notsurprisingly, a young Yasser Arafat met the famous SS commando-colonel whilebeing trained in “unconventional warfare” by the SS, and developed a friendshipthat “would reportedly last for many years.”34If it were merely Skorzeny and Remer who offered financial assistance, weapons,and training to Nasser, one could reasonably reject the argument that thisventure represented a coordinated effort by Bormann’s postwar NaziInternational. But when the presence of other prominent Nazis in Nasser’s Egyptis also weighed in the balance, the probability of that interpretation quicklyshrinks, and the probability of a coordinated covert effort by the postwar NaziInternational increases proportionally. The key is Skorzeny himself:> Skorzeny’s principal responsibility was to train thousands of Egyptian> commandos in guerilla and desert warfare. Furthermore, he organized and> planned the initial forays of the early Palestinian terrorists into Israel and> the Gaza Strip around 1953-1954. An Arab Foreign legion was created, whose> nucleus consisted of 400 former Nazi veterans who were recruited by the Arab> League agents in Germany. Finally, Skorzeny sought to protect German> scientists, technicians, and engineers who were recruited to work on Egypt’s> special military program.35 Skorzeny coordinated all this military activity with yet another German militaryadvisor in Nasser’s Egypt, SS Lieutenant General Wilhelm Farmbacher.36 But whatwere all these German scientists, technicians, and engineers doing in Egypt tobegin with?The clue is found in the presence in Egypt of none other than Dr. Wilhelm Voss,who had been sent to Egypt personally by West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer.For readers of my book Reich of the Black Sun, however, Dr. Voss will ring abell, for he was in fact the civilian liaison inside the engineering division ofthe Skoda Munitions work in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, and it is thanks to Voss’srevelations to British journalist Tom Agoston that the existence of SSObergruppenführer Hans Kammler’s secret weapons think tank inside of the Skodaworks was first publicly revealed.37 Voss was in Egypt coordinating thesecretive West German technical assistance being given to Nasser to develop hisown missiles capable of targeting Israel and other neighbors, but he was alsocoordinating West Germany’s economic assistance and trade with the new Nasserregime. Indeed, his influence in the early years of Nasser’s Egypt was sosweeping that he was in fact “the architect of the Egyptian economy in the earlypostwar years.”38 But there’s more, for according to George Michael and otherresearchers, it was Voss who, “working with Reinhard Gehlen, Skorzeny, andHjamlar Schact…increased West Germany’s trade with Egypt.”39 Not only wasSchacht present, but a former member of Nazi Propaganda minister Josef Göbbhels’Propaganda Ministry was represented in the form of Johann Von Leers, a formerassistant to Göbbels himself!40 Once in Egypt, Von Leers helped translate MeinKampf into Arabic – one only need recall Saddam Hussein’s copy in this regard –but also other Nazi “classics,” such as the notorious Protocols of the LearnedElders of Zion. Additionally, Von Leers assisted Nasser’s regime in churning outan endless stream of torrid anti-western and anti-Israeli propaganda.There are only two real explanations for this sudden appearance of so many highranking and well-connected Nazis in Nasser’s Egypt, one is “mere coincidence,”and the other is that it was by deliberate design. Obviously, the probability isthat it was by deliberate design, for pause and consider very carefully what itmeans: scarcely seven years after the end of the Second World War, and onlythree years after the grant of sovereignty by the Western Allies – France, GreatBritain, and the United States – to West Germany, we have present in Egypt thefollowing people:> 1) The Wehrmacht general who crushed the July 1944 coup attempt against> Hitler, and founder of the postwar neo-Nazi Socialist Reich Party in West> Germany, General Otto Remer;> 2) SS Colonel and Hitler’s favorite commando, Otto Skorzeny;> 3) The former president of Hitler’s Reichsbank, Dr. Hjalmar Horace Greeley> Schacht;> 4) The former civilian liaison to SS General Hans Kammler’s secret weapons> think tank inside the Skoda Works at Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, Dr. Wilhelm Voss;> 5) A former member of the Nazi propaganda ministry and a personal assistant to> Dr. Josef Göbbels himself, Johann Von Leers! The presence of so many people, including Hjalmar Schacht, Reinhard Gehlen, andSS Colonel Skorzeny, in this venture can hardly be accidental.2. Schacht’s Little Deal: The Jeddah Agreement Schacht’s activities in the Middle East also bear mentioning as well, for he –or his hidden masters – hardly restricted their economic vision to Egypt alone,for he was the major broker of the so-called “Jeddah Agreement” in 1954 betweenGerman industrial companies and Saudi Arabia. Under the protocols of thisagreement, Saudi Arabia “agreed to establish a fleet of supertankers – to bebuilt in German shipyards – that would transport Saudi oil around the world.”41And as if that were not enough to convince the most hardened skeptic that allthese connections can hardly be coincidental, “the Greek magnate, AristotleOnassis, was chosen to manage the shipping side of the arrangement.”42This deal, of course, directly threatened British and American oil interests inthe region, for it threatened to end their own cartelization of the commodityand the Middle East’s oil field. With the aid of the CIA, they succeeded inblocking the agreement.43 The very fact that the CIA was involved in this affairis an indicator that it was encountering very serious “blowback” in its earlybacking of the coup that brought Nasser into power in Egypt.3. The Ultimate Geopolitical Goal: The “Third Position” Again But what was the ultimate goal of all these maneuvers? Researcher George Michaelputs it as succinctly as any, and in so doing, points out yet another connectionto Nazi ideology and its worldwide agenda:> During this period, renascent Nazis saw the rise of Arab and Third World> nationalism as an excellent opportunity to create a German-Islamic neutralist> alliance that would extend from the heart of Europe to the South China Sea.> This idea was consistent with the late Karl Hausofer’s (sic, et passim) policy> of an alliance with the “Colored World.” Hausofer is generally regarded as> responsible for popularizing “geopolitics.” One vision of this new extreme> right foreign policy was to create – with the assistance of the grand Mufti> and the Arab League – a German-Egyptian-dominated power bloc that could resist> both the United States and the Soviet Union.44 In other words, behind the Nazi machinations in Egypt lies the much-olderhistorical foreign policy of Germany and, by implication, Prussia itself. Thiscreation of a “Third Bloc” between the United States and Communist Russia wasone of the major postwar goals of the Nazi International, for that bloc wouldinevitably have to be centered on Europe, and on Germany’s position as the stillpredominant European power. And as for (general) Karl Haushofer, he was, ofcourse, Adolf Hitler’s geopolitical guru, and one of the salient influences onHitler’s geopolitical views as expounded in Mein Kampf.Needless to say, not all went according to the postwar Nazi plans for Egypteither, for under increasing pressure from the Soviet Union, Nasser went out ofhis way to alienate his West German allies by recognizing the government of EastGermany. In response, West Germany retaliated by breaking relations with Egypt,and withdrawing its technical and economic support.45But even in these events, one may discern a palpable Nazi influence at work. AsI noted in my previous book The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, the presence ofGeneral Reinhard Gehlen’s espionage network inside of Eastern Europe implies thepossibility that this organization – the only intelligence organization withknown connections both to the Eastern and Western blocs – may have played a rolein the secret coordination of Russian and American space activities.46 But toput it in this political context gives that possibility more significance, foras German foreign policy has consistently and historically played East and Westoff against each other, the postwar Nazi International, if it was to pursue asimilar course of action, would have to have a presence in both blocs.Understandably, then, some postwar Nazis promoted closer cooperation with theEastern bloc.One of these was an old friend and associate of Otto Skorzeny – himself aproponent of a “westward” orientation - Dr. Fritz Grobba, who was Berlin’sambassador to Iraq and to Saudi Arabia prior to the Nazi-supported coup thatoverthrew the British puppet government in Baghdad! Indeed, he and the GrandMufti had both collaborated in this design.47 But after the war, this “former”Nazi Middle Eastern ambassador, and convert to Islam,48 wound up as “thedirector of Arab affairs at the Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow,”49 and thuswas the Soviet point man in brokering the first arms deal between the SovietUnion and Nasser’s Egypt! Not only that, there is also evidence that at the sametime that as Skorzeny acted as the liaison between the Nazi International, theAdenauer government in Bonn, and Egypt, he also “is thought to have helpedNasser’s alliance with the Soviet Union.”50To put it as succinctly as possible, Nazis were behind the overthrow of KingFarouk and the installation of Nasser, Nazis were behind the training of hisintelligence agency and army, Nazis not only helped guide Egypt’s economy, butthey were also behind Nasser’s alliance with the Soviet Union. Nor was thiswithout immediate economic and geopolitical repercussions, for as is now known,with his Nazi-trained troops, Soviet weapons, and Nazi-manipulated new alliancewith Moscow, Nasser seized the Suez Canal and successfully expelled the lastvestiges of French and British power and influence in Egypt. It is perhapssignificant, then, that Nasser eventually expelled the Soviets from Egypt, forif there was a hidden Nazi hand in the initial invitation, there may have beenone in the expulsion as well.a. An International Terrorists’ Summit In addition to direct postwar machinations in the various Middle Easternnations, there was also an attempt to penetrate and coordinate postwarinternational terrorist activity as well:> The Black International, which operated under the name of the European New> Order, held a summit at Barcelona on behalf of the Palestinians. The> organization was composed of various Nazis and fascists from Nazi Germany,> Vichy France, Franco’s Spain, Salazar’s Portugal, Mussolini’s Italy, and the> Greek colonels’ military junta. The Spanish leader, General Francesco (sic)> Franco, is believed to have endorsed the meeting. Two representatives from> Fatah, the military arm of the PLO, attended the event. Reportedly, the> delegates discussed raising money, organizing the arms traffic, and providing> ex-Nazi military instructors to help train guerillas. A major endeavor was to> recruit Caucasians to augment Fatah’s forces in the Middle East and also> collaborate in acts of sabotage and terrorism in Europe. Several summits> followed this event, including one held on September 16, 1972, barely ten days> after Palestinian Black September terrorists killed eleven Israeli athletes at> the Munich Olympics.51 In other words, the now familiar pattern of internationalizing Nazism around asolidly German core was again in evidence, in a deliberate effort to coordinateEuropean and Middle Eastern terrorist activity.b. The Neo-Nazi Connection to the Assassination of Pope John Paul II These efforts knew no bounds. As is now known, many members of Licio Gelli’snotorious P2-G Masonic lodge in Italy in the 1960s and 1970s had Fascist andNazi connections, and Gelli himself, in a less-than-coincidental and ironicparallel to the postwar Nazi ratlines, fled Italy to avoid prosecution. He went,of course, to Argentina. And one of the most notorious of these postwarterrorists affiliated with a Nazi-sponsored secret society was Mehmet Ali Agca,the assassin who attempted to murder Pope John Paul II in cold blood during apapal appearance at the Vatican shortly into the latter’s pontificate. Agca wasa member of a Turkish secret society called “The Gray Wolves,” a society foundedby a former Turkish SS member and volunteer, Mehmet Kengerle.52c. Mohamar Qaddafi’s “Perónism” Nor were Turkey, Egypt, Palestine and Iraq the only centers of pre- and post-warNazi attention. Mohammar Qaddafi’s Libya, widely regarded during the 1970s and1980s as a premier state sponsor of international terrorism, also had its ownrole. While there is no known direct connection between Qaddafi and postwarNeo-Nazism, it is peculiar that Qaddafi, who attempted to orchestrate his owninternational terrorist organization, did so in conjunction with his elaborationof a foreign policy that attempted to combine into a broad coalition nations andgroups seeking an alternative to the Western and Eastern blocs. Essentially,Qaddadi, who outlined his ideas in a treatise called The Green Book, attemptedto combine “nationalism, anticapitalism, anti-communism, and anti-imperialism,into a populist ideology.”53He called his idea “Third Positionism.”Shades of Juan Perón!d. The Historical Parallels and Geopolitical Implications of the “ThirdPosition:” As indicated in this and previous chapters, this “Third Position” was a majortheme in the designs of the postwar Nazi International. And that very positionitself is perhaps the indication of a hidden though very real German guidinghand on the international geopolitical stage in the postwar world, for that veryposition was a cardinal guiding principle of Prussian and German foreign policy,from the Prussia of Frederick the Great, through the Chancellorship of Otto VonBismarck and later, the Weimar Republic, and finally of course, Adolf Hitler’snon-agression pact with Joseph Stalin that secretly partitioned Poland and madeWorld War Two Possible.(1) Rapallo: The Pariahs Make a Deal The modern roots of this sometimes hidden, sometimes open German-Russiancollaboration begin, in fact, in the aftermath of World War One. In 1922, WeimarGermany and the Soviet Union, the two nations most effected and dislocatedeconomically by World War One, and the two nations that were the leastinfluential in great power politics in the face of the overwhelming Westernmilitary and economic superiority, were pariah nations. Not surprisingly, theydecided to make common cause. Signing an agreement in 1922 at Rapallo, bothnations agreed on mutually beneficial economic trade. But as a condition forsuch trade, German General Hans Von Seekt insisted on a secret protocol to thetreaty, and the newly installed Soviet regime, fresh from World War One and agrueling civil war, only too readily agreed.Von Seekt, as commander of the German army, was left under the terms of theVersailles treaty with a small standing army, no air force, and a navy onlysufficient enough for a meager coastal defense of Germany. For a general incommand of the army of a great power virtually surrounded by other great powers,this was, of course, an intolerable situation. Accordingly, Weimar Germanynegotiated a secret protocol with the Soviet Union that would allow Germanmilitary units to train with their Soviet counterparts on Russian soil, usingall the weapons – tanks, aircraft, and heavy artillery – prohibited to Germanyunder the Versailles Treaty. In this way, Von Seekt transformed the tiny GermanReichsheer into a highly professional army whose soldiers, once the time wasright, could be promoted and form the officer corps for a vastly expanded andhighly competent German army – the Wehrmacht - when full rearmament becamefeasible. Many of these Germans and Russians who trained with each other in theSoviet Union during the 1920s such as Colonel General Heinz Guderian – inventorof the blitzkrieg and whose Second Panzer Army very nearly entered Moscow in1941 – and Soviet Marshal Timoshenko, knew each other personally.(2) Frederick the Great and the Partitions of Poland But the historical roots of German foreign policy and Ostpolitik lie muchdeeper, reaching all the way back, as some have pointed out, to the TeutonicKnights and the ethnic relationship of Prussians – or Berussians – to Russiansthemselves. It has been a stormy relationship, to say the least. But the moreimmediate parallel to German and Russian cooperation – a parallel often noted byhistorians – are the three partitions of Poland between Prussia, Austria, andRussia, partitions readily agreed upon by Prussian king Frederick the Great andanother German monarch, Tsaritsa Catherine the Great. As Prussian and Russianeconomic interests penetrated an already weakened Poland, the two monarchs, withAustrian complicity, simply agreed to annex the portions of the country thateach wanted.Frederick, whose Ostpolitik helped transform Prussia into a Great Power, andwhose military reforms demonstrated Prussia’s military prowess by fighting thesuperior forces of Austria and Russia to a standstill in the Seven Years’ War,ended his reign with his country the dominant military power in central Europe.Frederick had introduced many of the traditions of the Teutonic Knights and mostof the modern images associated with German military tradition – the parade stepor “goosestep,” the ranking system, the ceremonial “bell tree” and so on – intothe Prussian army.When the Berlin wall came down and East and West Germany were reunited, theGerman government honored the Prussian king in a most traditional way, andalmost no one in the world’s major media outside Germany itself paid anyattention at all…image [images/00026.jpg] Otto Skorzeny, Hitler’s Favorite Commando image [images/00027.jpg] Skorzeny and Hitler image [images/00028.jpg] General Otto Remer at the Time of the Foiled Coup Attempt Against Hitler 1 George Michael, The Enemy of My Enemy: The Alarming Convergence of MilitantIslam and the Extreme Right, (University Press of Kansas, 2006), p. 112.2 George Michael, The Enemy of My Enemy: The Alarming Convergence of MilitantIslam and the Extreme Right, (University Press of Kansas, 2006), p. 112.3 George Michael, The Enemy of My Enemy: The Alarming Convergence of MilitantIslam and the Extreme Right, (University Press of Kansas, 2006), p. 113.4 Ibid.5 Joseph P.

As Michael also notes, there is evidence of limited cooperation betweenthe Nazi regime and Zionists themselves in this matter. From ChristopherSimpson’s book Blowback, it is known that Heydrich’s RSHA and the Gestapo helpedFivel Polkes train Jewish guerillas, at camps inside the Reich, for armedterrorist actions against the British mandate in Palestine.

And one of the first traditional symbols to be revived, orrather, reinterred, was “Old Fritz,” King Frederick the Great:> At the stroke of midnight on August 17, 1991, a casket containing the bones of> Frederick the Great was lowered into its original resting place at the Sans> Souci Palace near Potsdam.

No one seemed to have noticed, however, thatthe “bad” side of Frederick was being honored with all the “bad” traditions ofthe Prussian military ceremonial Kohl had just cautioned against! Perhaps thatis because behind the symbolism, as will be seen, there lurked something else,for the newly reunited Germany was reviving not merely as many aspects of itstraditional military pageantry as it could get away with, but the traditions ofdiplomacy, economics, and military muscle that Frederick epitomized.The symbolism was not lost on students of geopolitics and history elsewhere,however. One of them, President Jimmy Carter’s former national security advisorand Polish émigré Zbigniew Brzezinski - himself trained by German historians -noted that the post-unification expansion of NATO had as much to do with Germanyas it did making sure of Russia: “By enveloping Germany in a wider Euro-Atlanticframework…NATO enlargement resolves Europe’s central security problem of thetwentieth century, which has been how to cope effectively with the reality ofGerman power.”3Whatever the value of Zbigniew Brzezinski’s prognostications about the realityof German power may be, it will now be evident from previous chapters that theNazi International was ahead of the game, and, in fact, had anticipated thisresponse. Moreover, as has been argued in previous chapters, they fully intendedfor it to come about. They not only helped orchestrate it and planned not onlyto be a part of it, but to lead it by positioning Germany at the core of a“united Europe.” And when the Iron Curtain rusted away to be replaced once againby the Iron Cross, Germany not only rushed toward Wiedervereinigung orreunification, but fully intended to exploit the power vacuum left in EasternEurope by the Soviet departure and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. Thisexploitation would come in the form of German economic penetration and dominanceof the region, by German diplomatic efforts designed to exploit ethnic divisionsin polyglot nations such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia – both fictitious“nations” created by, and relics of, the Treaty of Versailles – by cleverly“recognizing” breakaway nations, and backing these up with German military forceand the presence of significant numbers of German troops outside the borders ofthe Fatherland for the first time since the Second World War.A. A Curious Incident: The GSG-9 and the Rescue of Andreas Strassmeir One of the most curious exercises of German military power outside Germanborders after the reunification was the deployment of the GSG-9 – the same groupthat shot the hijackers of Lufthansa flight 181 and rescued all its passengersin Mogadishu, Somalia – to rescue a German national in dubious circumstances:one Andreas Strassmeir.Only in this case, the GSG-9 was deployed not to an African third world country,but to the United States!Strassmeir’s rescue by the GSG-9 was effected because of his involvement on the“peripheries” of the infamous Oklahoma City Bombing. Strassmeir, according toeyewitnesses in Tulsa, Oklahoma, had been seen in the company of Timothy McVeighat a local strip bar called Godiva’s on Sheridan Avenue by a local informant forthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and firearms, Carol Howe. But what was so unusualabout Strassmeir that would require the involvement of the German GSG-9 to gethim out of the country? Why was one young German so important?As the circumstances surrounding the OKC Bombing began to be probed in the daysand weeks immediately after the event by radio talk show hosts and independentinvestigative journalists, the riddles connected to the mysterious HerrStrassmeir only grew. One such radio talk show host, Chuck Harder of thePeople’s Radio Network, reported on his show the strange events that unfolded inthe immediate aftermath of the Bombing that directly concerned Strassmeir.According to Harder and his reporters, at a routine police roadblock nearMuldrow and Roland, Oklahoma (just over the border from Fort Smith, Arkansas),Strassmeir was apprehended by local deputies for driving without a license orvalid plates. According to some versions of the story, Strassmeir also had withhim an attaché case which he refused to open and that he claimed were full of“papers.”4Under the circumstances, the deputy, suspicious, incarcerated Strassmeir in thelocal jail. Some time later, the local sheriff’s department (or, depending onthe version of the story, local highway patroil) began to receive phone callsinsisting that the sheriff release Strassmeir. What made the calls strange,however, were that they came from no less than the then Governor of Oklahoma,Frank Keating, and a pentagon lieutenant general. Both insisted that Strassmeirhad diplomatic immunity, and thus could not be arrested for anything!4Then things began to get strange.1. Reunification: Kohl, Günter Strassmeir, and Nazi Anniversaries As reporters probed further into this unusual McVeigh associate, they discoveredthat he had come to this country with the ostensible purpose of being aparticipant in Civil War battle reenactments. Strassmeir told his lawyer that hemerely was a Civil War enthusiast and a “reenacter” and wanted to participate inthe numerous reenactments at the historical sites.But the reality was quite different.Strassmeir, it turned out, was a former lieutenant in the Bundeswehr, the GermanArmy, and, moreover, a graduate of Germany’s prestigious Hanover War Academy,Germany’s version of West Point, and had served honorably with the German Armyin its elite panzergrenadier, or mechanized armored infantry units.5 Not onlythis, but Strassmeir resided at Elohim City, a notorious white supremacistreligious group in Oklahoma with its own deep and broad connections to a varietyof underground American neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups. Morover,Strassmeir was the compound’s “security chief,” who trained the group insurvival tactics, small arms tactics, guerilla operations, and so on.But even that is not all:> … the German paramilitary expert admitted in a court affidavit that he had met> McVeigh at a Tulsa gun show shortly after the Waco massacre. Strassmeir sold a> combat knife to McVeigh and gave him his business card. That’s as far as it> went, according to Strassmeir, who insists that he had no further dealings> with McVeigh.> While in Tulsa, Strassmeir also visited the home of his beer-drinking buddy,> Dennis Mahon, the Oklahoma-based Klansman who lit crosses in reunified> Germany. And Mahon often spent weekends at Elohim City, boozing it up with> Strassmeir…> Strassmeir denies any involvement in the Oklahoma City attack. There is no> doubt, however, that he had extensive links to America’s violent racialist> underground. Strassmeir’s roommate at Elohim City was Michael Brescia, who> subsequently confessed to his own role as a member of the Ayran Republican> Army (ARA), a fanatical white supremacist sect that sought to overthrow the> U.S. government, purge the country of blacks and Jews, and install a new legal> system based entirely on their own weird interpretation of the Bible. (Four of> the six known ARA members lived at Elohim City or often visited there.) To> raise money for the cause, the ARA robbed twenty-two banks in eight Midwestern> states during the mid-1990s. These armed assaults were carried out by ARA> extremists who had been trained in weapons and guerilla tactics by Strassmeir…> The ARA’s German paramilitary instructor managed to elude the long arm of the> law, even though the Oklahoma State Patrol had issued a BOLO (“Be on the> look-out”) alert for Andreas Strassmeir, which indicated that he was an armed> and potentially dangerous “illegal alien.” Although several U.S. government> agencies were aware of Strassmeir’s presence at Elohim City, immigration> authorities never tried to deport him.6 As the news reporters doggedly sniffed out the Strassmeir trail, however, itsuddenly went completely cold……Until the young German suddenly showed up at his family home in Berlin, gave abrief press conference stating that he was indeed alive and well and notcompletely missing – after all, by that time, all of America’s law enforcementagencies were looking for him – and then faded quietly from view. So what hadhappened between the mysterious phone calls to the local law enforcement inRoland, Oklahoma from Governor Keating and the anonymous Pentagon lieutenantgeneral, and Strassmeir’s sudden reappearance in his native Germany?According to Strassmeir’s close friend and American attorney, Kirk Lyons – a mannot without his own connections to America’s radical underground right7 – andothers, Strassmeir was spirited out of this country by none other than Germany’selite GSG-9 commando unit! Substantiating claims of Strassmeir’s possible deepinvolvement and connection to intelligence and elite paramilitary units,researcher Victor Thorn recounts two relevant incidents. Shortly after arrivingin this country, Strassmeir eventually made his way to Texas where he> aligned himself with a citizen’s militia called the Texas Light Infantry> Brigade. The only problem was: the members of the group quickly became> suspicious of Strassmeir’s motivations and loyalty, so they followed him late> one night to a federal building. There, they saw Strassmeir approach an> electric lock on the door, upon which he punched in the code on an electronic> keypad. And just like that, Strassmeir gained access to the building. What> makes this scenario relevant is that the federal building conveniently housed> an office of the ATF. Anyway, after witnessing this transgression, the (Texas> Light Infantry Brigade) gave Strassmeir his walking papers for being a> suspected undercover agent.8 Thorn then zeros in on the obvious questions this incident provokes:> At this point we must ask ourselves: who was Andreas Strassmeir? On July 14,> 1996, The McCurtain Gazette reported that, according to a highly-placed source> at the FBI’s intelligence division, he was a paid ATF informant or asset sent> to infiltrate Elohim City. This sentiment was echoed by Timothy McVeigh’s> lawyer, Stephen Jones, during a 1998 interview on KTOK radio in Oklahoma City.> Jones said Strassmeir was a German national recruited by (then FBI Director)> Louis Freeh to do deep undercover and intelligence operations for the FBI in> the United States. He also said that he discussed Strassmeir’s FBI alliance to> the German government with U.S. prosecutor Beth Wilkinson. There is also (an)> FBI form 302 which has been unearthed stating that Strassmeir was a CIA asset> on loan from the German government. Now, as you’ve noticed, three different> agencies have been mentioned – the FBI, ATF, and CIA – in relation to who> (sic) Strassmeir was working for. And until our government is more forthcoming> with information, we can’t be certain of any more precise details other than> he was a shared asset on loan to the U.S. government.9 In other words, as the story unfolded, Strassmeir was revealed to have thefollowing connections:> 1) Known connections to Timothy McVeigh;> 2) A known connection to the American far-right and “white supremacist” groups> via his attorney Kirk Lyons and his role as security chief for Elohim City;> 3) Known connections to the German Army, in which he was a former lieutenant> and graduate of the Hanover War Academy, Germany’s “West Point;”> 4) Highly probable connections to American intelligence –the FBI, ATF, and CIA> have been mentioned – as well as powerful American influences that were> wielded on his behalf from the American military, the State Department, and> Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating.With these connections, it is highly unlikely that the story of Strassmeir’srescue in this country by the GSG-9 that was initiated by his attorney KirkLyons is true, since such influence as was wielded on his behalf by Americansources could more than easily have surreptitiously spirited him out of thecountry.However, there is one highly significant fact that places the story of the GSG-9rescue of Strassmeir in a very different light, making it not only possible thatit was involved in Strassmeir’s rescue, but likely. When the Berlin Wall camedown and West Germany for all intents and purposes annexed East Germany, Andreasattended the reunification ceremonies with his father, Günter Strassmeir, andChancellor Helmut Kohl himself. This is significant, for after Strassmeir showedup in Berlin once again after having suddenly disappeared in the U.S.A.,American officials investigating the Oklahoma City Bombing attempted to questionhim in 1997, and requested intelligence files and information from the Germangovernment.Germany, not surprisingly, replied that it had no police or intelligence filesconcerning Strassmeir and absolutely no data on him whatsoever, an odd statementgiven the fact that Strassmeir was a former officer in the German Army, agraduate of its war academy, and more importantly, the son of Günter Strassmeir,the head of the Christian Democrat Union party in Berlin, Chancellor Kohl’schief of staff, a minister-without-portfolio, and one of the masterminds of theGerman reunification itself.10And the date when East and West Germans climbed the Berlin wall and began totear it down by hand was November 9, 1989, a significant Nazi anniversary, foron that night in 1938, the notorious Kristallnacht or “Night of Crystal”occurred, when Nazi storm troopers openly sacked, vandalized, and looted GermanJewish shops and brutalized German Jews openly and publicly. Moreover, on thatsame date in 1923, Adolf Hitler led his abortive putsch attempt against thestate government of Bavaria.2. Implications of the Incident: U.S. Complicity or Not? Given these revelations, how then does one interpret Andreas Strassmeir’s suddendisappearance in this country and his sudden reappearance in Berlin, for clearlyhe had some covert help in eluding U.S. investigators probing the OKC Bombing.The question is, who was ultimately controlling him and pulling the strings toget him out of America? There are three basic ways of interpreting the clues:> 1) Strassmeir was working for German intelligence and was on loan to the> U.S.A.’s intelligence agencies as an undercover agent to penetrate American> neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups with ties to European groups. In this> case, his father pulled diplomatic strings and high level American pressure> was exerted to obtain his release from local law enforcement. Since American> intelligence was also investigating the Oklahoma City Bombing, the U.S. may> have told the Germans that it was too sensitive for them to get Strassmeir out> of the country themselves, and that the Germans would have to do it on their> own without American involvement;> 2) Strassmeir was working for American intelligence directly, and when his> cover was blown by the initial post-bombing investigations, Strassmeir’s> father decided it was too hot of a situation and exerted pressure to obtain> his release, and called upon his friend, Chancellor Kohl, to deploy the GSG-9> and smuggle his son back to Germany;> 3) Strassmeir was playing both German and American intelligence for fools, and> was working sincerely for his American radical right and white supremacist> contacts, and directly for some hidden “neo-Nazi directorate.” Given the power> and extent of Neo-Nazi influence within Germany itself and particularly in> Kohl’s government, pressure was exerted on the German government – and it> probably did not require much pressure – to deploy the GSG-9 and smuggle> Strassmeir out of the U.S.A. safely back to Germany. As unlikely as the last scenario sounds, there is circumstantial evidence thatsuggests a hidden Nazi influence at work not only in the German reunificationitself, but that also suggests that the GSG-9 was indeed covertly deployed tothe United States without the latter’s consent or knowledge to return the Germanspy and agent provocateur to Germany.3. Kohl’s Neo-Nazi Connections and the Neo-Nazi Push for Reunification To see what that circumstantial evidence is, one must look closer at the thenGerman Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, himself. Kohl had personally awarded anddecorated a German industrialist, Fritz Ries, with the Bundesverdienstkreuz, orFederal Cross of Merit. Ries during the Second World War made his fortune byappropriating “Aryanized” Jewish property seized from Jews sent to the deathcamps, and in fact had operated factories near Auschwitz that relied on slavelabor from the camps.11 This was not a mere accident or oversight on Kohl’s partnor a lapse of proper vetting of Ries by his staff, for Kohl was a well-knownattendee and public speaker throughout his Chancellorship to the SilesianExpellees’ Society, from which he also received substantial campaigncontributions. The Silesian Expellees’ Society is one of many such societies inGermany, composed of Germans or their descendents who lost their homes and landto Poland when the latter country was shifted westward and absorbed Germany’seastern provinces. Most of these societies are well-known to have deep Neo-Naziconnections, and Kohl’s government either openly supported such societies ortolerated their activities.12Not surprisingly, given the Kohl Government’s own open use of revived symbols ofGerman militarism – witness only the ceremonial burial of King Frederick theGreat with full Prussian-style military honors – and his support for, andsupport by, expellee societies, the amount of violence against non-ethnicGermans in the newly reunified Reich rose significantly, as did neo-fascistpolitical victories in local and state elections. German police, for example,found “a neo-Nazi bomb factory in Jena and confiscated sizable amounts ofdynamite, machine guns, ammunition, and military gear. The local prosecutor saidthe arsenal reflected ‘a new quality in weaponry and violent preparations’ ofGerman neo-Nazi groups.”13 Such incidents were repeated across the country, aswill be seen momentarily.More importantly, the reunification revealed another sinister fact aboutpost-reunification German – and Eastern European – politics, for despite thefact of decades of Communist rule, neo-Nazi, neo-Fascist and radically rightwing nationalist groups had secretly grown and festered throughout EasternEurope, and nowhere more strongly than in the provinces of the former EastGermany. For example, in elections held in April of 1998, Deutsche Volksunion, ascarcely disguised neo-Nazi political party, managed to win a stunning 13percent of the vote in regional elections in Sachsen-Anhalt province. Anotherthinly disguised neo-Nazi party, the National Democratic Party, also wonsignificant percentages in other local elections in the former eastern zone.These successes were attributed to the fact that these parties appealed tosmoldering German resentment against the number of non-ethnic German foreignworkers in the country who, the parties alleged, were stealing jobs from nativeGermans.14 No one seemed to have noticed that the former eastern zone had lessthan one percent of its population composed of such foreign workers.With these election victories and Kohl’s reelection bid pending at a nationallevel, his government and Christian Democratic Union party careened to thepolitical right to such an extent that it became “increasingly difficult todiscern where political expediency ended and right-wing extremism began.”15 Whyhad Kohl and the Christian Democratic Party lurched so far to the right – adangerous move even after reunification, since the vast majority of Germans wholived in the former West Germany would never support such a government (atleast, not openly).4. The Shotgun Wedding In order to appreciate the full significance of the neo-Nazi connections ofKohl’s government, his party’s rightward lurch, and the subsequent policies ofhis “left wing” Social Democrat successor, Gerhard Schröder, it is necessary toexamine the real - though in the United States almost unknown - role thatneo-Nazi groups actually played in orchestrating and driving the reunification.As open protests against Communist regimes grew throughout Eastern Europe, firstin Poland with Lech Walesa’s Solidarity movement, and then other easternEuropean nations, similar protests naturally began in East Germany, the mostnotoriously “Communist” and pro-Soviet government in the former Warsaw Pact.Initially these protests were led by East German intellectuals who, far fromdesiring a collapse of the East German state and reunification with the muchmore powerful West German government in Bonn, merely wished to introduce reformsthat would introduce a mix of socialism and capitalism – the Nazi-inspired“third way” once again! – to the East German state.But as the protests spread throughout East Germany and finally reached Berlin,with West Berliners and East Berliners climbing the wall and beginning to tearit down, something else had happened. The covert neo-Nazi groups in the easternzone came out in force, and propelled the release of populist energy in a newdirection, reunification:> Emblematic of this shift in sensibility, the original chant of “Wir sind das> Volk!” (“We are the people!”) gave way at mass rallies to the rousing refrain> “Wir sind ein Wolk!” (“We are one people!”) And of course, the phrase “ein Volk!”, “one people,” was itself part of aclassic Nazi propaganda slogan: “Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer!”: “One People,one Reich, one Leader!” Shortly after the appearance of this slogan,> It did not take long before the uglier side of German nationalism began to> assert itself. In Leipzig and other East German cities, skinhead youth> hoisting flags of the 1937 German Reich marched alongside of those demanding> unification. Soon proponents of unity, including neo-Nazi militants, started> to clash openly with those who still cherished the possibility of an> independent East German state.16 It does not take a Nazi rocket scientist to figure out the parallelism at work,for in a manner similar to the Nazi Party’s original private army of brownshirts, which literally physically brutalized its political opponents intosubmission and silence, those opposing reunification were physically silencedand effectively closed out of any debate.On the other side of this fast-crumbling Iron Curtain, West German ChancellorKohl was driving the process of unification “at breakneck speed,”17 weighing inwith a “unilateral plan to unite the (German Democratic Republic) and the BonnRepublic.”18 And the man who played a significant role in the formulation ofthat suspiciously ready-to-hand reunification plan was none other than WestBerlin Christian Democratic Union party chief, Günter Strassmeir, whose sonAndreas was a former German officer with deep connections to America’s radicalright. This fact, more than anything else, indicates why Germany probably diddeploy the GSG-9 to the U.S.A., and why it may have done so without America’sknowledge or consent, for if Strassmeir had been apprehended and held inAmerican jails, even more compromising information damaging to Kohl’s governmentmay have come to light.So what do we have? According to the popular media portrayal of thereunification, we have a set of “coincidences”:> 1) A coincidental outbreak of public protests against the Communist East> German regime led by East German intellectuals demanding significant reforms> and a continuation of the East German state in a “third position” between> western capitalism and Soviet Communism, a position historically that of> German foreign policy and a now well-demonstrated Nazi postwar policy that> reappears time and again in regions or countries where postwar Nazis had a> significant influence;> 2) The subsequent co-opting of this spontaneous outbreak of German populism in> East Germany by the open appearance of neo-Nazis who change the nature of the> protestors’ demands from reforms to reunification, which is accompanied by the> use of revived and thinly-disguised Nazi propaganda slogans and the open> display of flags and banners of the Nazi Reich;> 3) These events culminate “coincidentally” on the night of November 9, 1989> when East and West Berliners storm the Berlin wall and begin to demolish it,> on the anniversary of the Kristallnacht anti-Jewish pogrom and of Hitler’s> 1923 Munich Beer Hall putsch attempt;> 4) Kohl’s government weighs in with a unilateral plan for the reunification –> which implies a degree of preparation and foreknowledge on the part of his> government that the events in the eastern zone would unfold as they would;> 5) Subsequently Kohl allows and promotes the resurgence of the use of the> traditional symbols of the German military, and establishes the symbolic> connection of his government with the “old Germany” by a full honors> reinternment and burial of king Frederick the Great in Berlin, and later> authorizes a Prussian-style torchlight military ceremony at the Brandenburg> Gate celebrating the removal of Allied and Soviet troops, while> simultaneously,> 6) Kohl and the Christian Democratic Union openly court the expellee> societies, and his reunification advisor’s son, Andreas Strassmeir, is> spirited out of the United States after American investigators identified him> as a significant and suspicious figure in the associates of Tim McVeigh. Given the significant level of neo-Nazi influence and open activity in drivingthe reunification from the East German side, Kohl’s own suspiciouslyready-to-hand plan for reunification, his connections to expellee societies withNazi connections, and the allegations of Andreas Strassmeir’s connections toAmerican white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups, one cannot altogether discountthe distinct possibility that driving all these events is a “deep politics” anddeeply hidden masters with very deep, well-connected Nazi roots.In a maneuver reminiscent of Hitler’s Saar Plebiscite of 1935 that threw theFrench out of the coal-rich Saar and paved the way for Hitler’s subsequentstep-by-step dismantling of the Versailles Treaty (with the reintroduction ofconscription the same year and the reoccupation and remilitarization of theRhineland a year later), Kohl’s plan of reunification cleverly called for theEast Germans themselves to decide whether or not to reunite with West Germany.Needless to say, they voted overwhelmingly to do so, and there was little aneconomically weakened Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev could do about it. Itwas, as author Martin A. Lee puts it, “more like a shotgun annexation than amarriage of equal partners.”195. The Ugly Side of Reunificationa. The Rostock Incident In addition to all these “coincidences,” a series of violent attacks againstethnic non-Germans throughout the newly reunified country broke out“spontaneously,” primarily in the former East Germany. Utilizing a neo-Nazicomputer network called the Thule network, an international “electronic fascism”consisting of a tapestry of bulletin boards, blog sites and so on, and cellphones, Neo-Nazi groups published information on political rallies, how topublish newsletters, and gave practical advice on the use of paramilitarypolitical violence.20One of the most significant of these violent attacks against non-German ethnicgroups was the Rostock Incident:> At times, German neo-Nazi leaders were able to beat the authorities in a game> of cat and mouse by using computers, walkie-talkies, portable phones, and> answering machines. New methods of communication enabled the neo-Nazis to> avoid police roadblocks and deliver commands to convoys of ultrarightists as> they made their way to political demonstrations. Such high-tech gimmickry was> employed in late August 1992, when Ewald Althans and hundreds of his cohorts> slipped into the Baltic seaport of Rostock in eastern Germany under the cover> of darkness. Some had come all the way from Austria and Scandinavia to> participate in a frenzied outburst of ethnic cleansing.> In a scene starkly reminiscent of the 1930s, thousands of local residents> roared approvingly as a throng of neo-Nazis attacked a refugee center for> Romanian Gypsies. As the immigrant shelter went up in flames, an ecstatic> crowd sang “Tannenbaum” (A Christmas hymn) and “Deutschland über Alles.” A> Local law-enforcement official, Jürgen Deckert, later acknowledged that “the> police had an arrangement with the rowdies not to intervene.”> While the police stood idly by, the neo-Nazis regrouped and attacked another> guest hostel with a barrage of Molotov cocktails. More than a hundred> Vietnamese guest workers and their families were trapped inside the burning> building, along with a German television crew. The reporters telephoned> Rostock’s fire and police departments in a futile attempt to summon help.> Nearly suffocating from smoke, the terrorized inhabitants moved from floor to> floor until they reached the top level of the twelve-story apartment complex.> Down below, the angry mob screamed, “Lynch them!” and “Blood justice!” With> only minutes to spare before the entire structure turned into a deadly> inferno, they pried open a locked door with iron bars, crawled onto the roof,> and narrowly escaped by leaping to the top of another building. Miraculously,> no one was killed.> Government authorities in the German state of Mecklenburg-West Pommerania> subsequently disclosed that they had learned of neo-Nazi plans to “clean up”> Rostock before the violence erupted, yet no preventive measures were ordered.> Interior Minister Rudolf Seiters refused to call out the> Bundesgrenz-schutzpolizei (Germany’s national military police) to defend the> Rostock refugee center, allegedly because of a shortage of manpower. But> plenty of heavily armed law-enforcement personnel were available when more> than a thousand antifascists turned up in town to show solidarity with the> beleagured foreigners.

By meeting their> demands, the German government had allowed a violent minority to decisively> shape the national political agenda.21 The sense of a terrible déjà vu that hangs over these events cannot be gainsaid,discounted, nor excused, nor did responsible voices in the Kohl Government andthe German media seek to do so. And the vast majority of German citizensthemselves were horrified at the events. They may indeed have cost Kohl theChancellorship in his loss to Social Democrat Gerhard Schröder in 1998.In the light of the total context of the previous seven chapters, and in thelight of the chapters to come, one may perceive it for what it really is: theexploitation on the European scene of the same ethnic and economic tensions theNazi International exploited so successfully elsewhere in the postwar world. Andthat means that as late as the mid-1990s, Martin Bormann’s Nazi Internationalwas alive, well, and able to mount a coordinated effort right in the heart ofEurope, and to drive both sides of a crisis in a classic Hegelian fashion bycarefully advocating an “East German Third Position Reform” as the thesis,propelling the neo-Nazi cooption of that movement by demands for reunification,yet another “Third Position”, and proposing a unilateral scheme forreunification from Kohl’s “expellee society-influenced” government itself. Makeno mistake, this is not some “flaw in the German national character” or somewayward gene in the Teutonic gene pool; this was the result of an evil, brutal,and genocidal ideology that once ruled and exploited those flaws, and that wasstill well-organized, well-financed, and inherently predisposed to do so onceagain. Without the neo-Nazis, there would have been no reunification.b. The Post-Reunification Surge of Terrorism But there is another as yet unexplored consequence of German reunification andof the forces that propelled it, and it remains unexplored primarily because itis so obvious. According to German officials themselves, in 1992 the amount offirebombings and explosives attacks in Germany skyrocketed almost 33 percentfrom the previous year. Similarly, they also noted an increase in the number oforganized right-wing extremists to well over 65,000, approximately “10 precentof whom were deemed to be hard-core neo-Nazi militants.”22The violence grew proportionally to the increasing passivity not only of theaverage German citizen but of the Kohl Government iself, reaching such a pitchthat even the U.S. Army formulated a report indicating its own concerns aboutthe safety of American military personnel, especially those of non-Caucasianraces.23 Indeed, many in Germany and elsewhere actually began to questionwhether or not the neo-Nazis were “functioning as a de facto fifth wheel ofstate policy, forcing foreigners to leave the Fatherland under a hail ofbullets, bombs, and baseball bats”.24 Even the Social Democrats capitulated toKohl’s demands and, in a crucial alignment with his Christian Democrats,mustered the necessary two thirds majority in the Bundestag to amend the Germanfederal constitution closing Germany’s borders to political refugees andasylum-seekers. It was a modification that neo-Nazi groups began to demandalmost as soon as West Germany was granted national sovereignty by the westernAllies in 1949. Not surprisingly, the German government began to enlist the sameneo-Nazi skinheads that had driven the populist demands for reunification intoits Bundesgrenzschutzpolizei, its national military border police, to make sureGermany’s borders were truly and genuinely closed.25To put it succinctly, the German reunification may be the best example of thepostwar Nazi International’s manipulation and exploitation of conflict by meansof the Hegelian dialectical technique, for at each stage of that technique –thesis, antithesis, synthesis – one finds the presence of neo-Nazis, theirfriends, or their ideas.B. Flexing Muscle and Other Old Traditions of the Third Position1. The Soviet Implosion No sooner was the Fatherland “one big happy Reich” once again than Germany beganto flex its economic – and military – muscle on the European stage:> The precipitous implosion of the Soviet Union into fifteen separate countries> left a huge power vacuum on the Continent – a vacuum that a reunified Germany,> by virtue of its pivotal location and economic might, was poised to fill. No> longer confined to the perimeter of the Atlantic system, Germany would once> again become the arbiter of Mitteleuropa, a geopolitical construct that lay> dormant while the Federal Republic bode its time as a frontline state during> the Cold War. German hegemony throughout the region, whether consciously> pursued or otherwise, appeared to be a fait accompli. “Central Europe is going> to have a strong German flavor again,” said retired State Department officer> Douglas H. Jones. “Even if it’s not intentional, Germany could lurch into a> destabilizing role.”26 In a certain sense, the Soviet implosion and the collapse of the Warsaw Pactcreated such a vacuum that Germany literally could be, and was, sucked into adominant role in Eastern Europe once again.2. German Investment Strategy But it was not as if the German government and German business were not readyfor the eventuality. The high cost of reunification necessitated a penetrationin depth rather than breadth into the smaller economies of Eastern Europe.Accordingly, “Germany invested strategically, rather than profusely, in EasternEurope, focusing on crucial areas such as energy supplies, transportation,telecommunications, and mass media.”27 This soon translated into new politicalmuscle on the world stage, and a “bossier manner” as Germany began to insistupon a “United Nations Security Council seat” and that “German be elevated tothe status of an official language within the European Community.”283. Breaking Free of NATO These moves were almost simultaneously accompanied by similar Germanassertiveness regarding NATO and its own armed forces. Germany’s ConstitutionalCourt, in a crucial 1994 ruling, declared that the German Armed Forces couldparticipate in military operations beyond NATO’s jurisdiction, and the thenGerman Defense Minister Wolker Rühe, in a Bundeswehr (German Army) White Papercirculated within the upper echelons of the German defense and intelligenceestablishment that same year, stated that “the German army would henceforthfunction as ‘an instrument of foreign policy.’”29 This was classic Prussianmilitary and foreign policy restated, for it was Von Clausewitz himself in hisclassic On War who stated the maxim that war is diplomacy by other means.Reunified Germany had served notice, quietly, but very firmly, that the gloveswere off once again, and that Washington and Moscow would no longer have virtualveto power over Germany’s defense and diplomatic agendas. As the then GermanForeign Minister Klaus Kinkel put it, the 1994 court decision and BundeswehrWhite Paper gave Germany “Freedom of action in foreign policy. The brake thatwas holding us back is gone.”304. Germany and the Arms Trade With all these statements and maneuvers happening quietly while most majorWestern media outlets scarcely covered them, it should come as no surprise thatnewly reunified Germany quickly became the world’s second largest exporter ofarms, second only to the United States.31 And after having absorbed the formerEast German army, Germany could afford to reduce its standing army to 350,000,which still made the well-equipped and competently led Bundeswehr the largestarmy in Europe,32 and one of the largest standing armies for a nation of itspopulation in the world.But Germany’s intentions did not stop there. NATO itself, which had beenintended as a check on both Soviet, and at the time of its formation, potentialGerman expansion, was now revealed for what it was, as least, as far as Germanyperceived it:> Although NATO was supposed to contain Germany as well as Russia, it proved to> be the vehicle through which German military power was restored. And now that> the superpower face-off had ended, German leaders indicated that they were> ready to develop new security structures outside of NATO, including a European> military force composed initially of 35,000 French and German soldiers.33 The modern French military – no resemblance to the demoralized French militaryof the Third Republic that performed so poorly against the German Wehrmacht in1940 – not only is very well-equipped and well-led, but France, as the world’sthird largest thermonuclear power, coupled with Germany, would be a powerfuleconomic and military alliance in its own right. The proposal from the newlyrelocated German government in Berlin was, needless to say, the source of someconsternation at green-topped conference tables in Washington, D.C., and WallStreet, where the continental outlook of both European powers might well indeedtranslate into such “new security measures.”But even greater concern was quietly expressed when German military think tanksopenly reasserted the German claims to sovereignty and “Germany’s nuclearweapons research program.”34 Even the publisher of Germany’s popular “liberal”magazine Der Spiegel (The Mirror) openly declared that situations could beconceived that Germany would have to have its own nuclear deterrent “in spite ofexisting treaties.”35 Yet, with world attention focused on Iran’s potentialnuclear pop-gun, not a word has been said in the major western media about thefar larger nuclear – and thermonuclear – potential of Germany, which, likeJapan, could arm itself to the teeth with such weapons in a very short time ifthe situation demanded, for in fact, Germany never stopped perfecting anddeveloping the means of isotope enrichment that it had begun to develop in WorldWar Two,36 and indeed, was one of the world’s major exporters of suchtechnologies along with Russia and France.5. Germany and Saddam Hussein’s WMD’s and Secret Police If there is any doubt about Germany’s role in the proliferation of nuclearweapons, consider only Bonn’s role in the military buildup of Saddam Hussein’sIraq, a role that, in spite of the U.S. media’s description of the facts, faroutstripped the Soviet Union’s role, for it was Germany, not Russia, that gaveto Saddam the beginnings of his nuclear, chemical, and biological weaponsprograms:> With the full knowledge and cooperation of the federal government and its BND> spy apparatus, dozens of German companies were instrumental in helping Saddam> Hussein develop one of the world’s most diversified unconventional-warfare> arsenals. Several of West Germany’s biggest firms supplied equipment and> expertise to set up entire plants for the production of nuclear, chemical, and> biological weaponry. Other countries, including the United States, cashed in> on the macabre bonanza that created Iraq’s high-tech death machine during the> 1980s, but Bonn’s role far outstripped the international competition. In> addition to constructing Saddam’s underground bunker and extending the range> of the Scud missiles to be able to hit Israel, German engineers concocted new> delivery systems for poison gas and dispensed advice on the most efficient way> to enrich uranium into weapons-grade fuel for a nuclear bomb.37 What had begun long before as German and Nazi intelligence interest in Iraqfinally bore fruition, as those contacts, never really erased by the war, wereable to leverage these lucrative arms contracts for Germany. More importantly,as I noted in my previous book The Cosmic War: Interplanetary Warfare, ModernPhysics, and Ancient Texts, Germany’s assistance to Iraq also came in the formof on-the-ground German support for the numerous archaeological projects begununder Hussein’s regime. While the German archaeologists and their Frenchcolleagues were withdrawn from that country prior to the American invasion in2003, the German intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichten-dienst, maintains aheavy presence in the country.38Bonn, in fact, from the period of the first Gulf War in 1991 up to the secondAnglo-American invasion in 2003, bluntly thumbed its nose at repeated Americanand United Nations trade embargos on Iraq and “continued to provide Iraq withmissile parts, chemical agents, and state-of-the-art engineering equipment,” and“later it would be disclosed that the BND had trained Iraqi and Libyan secretpolice units.”396. “Third Position” German Initiatives in Eastern and Central Europe These abrupt policy and attitude changes in Bonn and Berlin after thereunification were quickly followed up by very real flexing of German militaryand diplomatic muscle in several independent moves that signaled Germany’s newindependence on the international geopolitical scene. These initiativesconcentrated. on “revising Versailles” once again, by exploiting the growingnationalism within Versailles-created multi-ethnic “nations” such as Yugoslavia– a polyglot nation with significant minorities of Roman Catholic Croatians,Bosnian and Kosovan Muslims, and the majority Eastern Orthodox Serbs – andCzechoslovakia, another polyglot nation stitched together from Bohemian Czechsto Slovenian Slovaks and Ruthenians. And more ominously, Germany quietlysignaled that it was also prepared to begin the long-term recovery of its losteastern provinces, areas of territory occupied by modern-day Poland and Russia.Indeed, if the newly reunified Germany was to dominate Mitteleuropa and easternEurope once again, these two relatively powerful polyglot nations,Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, created by Versailles precisely to encircleGermany, had to be broken apart. If this sounds familiar, it should, for AdolfHitler did one and the same thing to both countries, breaking Czechoslovakiaapart prior to absorbing it, and absorbing Yugoslavia before breaking it apartand recognizing a puppet Nazi-controlled regime in Croatia.a. Revising Versailles Once Again: Germany and the Crack-up of Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia was once again the first nation to fall before reunifiedGermany’s new post-Cold War new order in Europe. In 1992 Czechoslovakia brokeapart into two parts,> A rupture fostered in part by a German foundation closely linked to the> Christian Social Union (the Bavarian sister party of Kohl’s CDU), which> channeled funds to Slovak separatists and supported the rise of Slovakian> strongman Vladimir Meciar, who enjoyed cordial relations with Bonn. During> this period, the Sudetendeutsche Landsmannschaft and its neo-Nazi allies> stubbornly maintained that ethnic German expels and their descendants should> be allowed to resettle in the Sudetenland - which composed one-third of the> (remaining) Czech Republic – while retaining their German citizenship. Note that Czechoslovakia was broken apart by almost exactly the same means thatNazi Germany used in 1939 to accomplish the same thing:> 1) covert German funding of Slovakian nationalism culminating in a breakaway> of that province to form its own government under a German puppet installed in> Bratislava (is this March 1939? Or is it 1992? Is it live? Or is it Memorex?);> 2) Neo-Nazi (or is it just plain old Nazi?) demands that Sudeten Germans in> the border regions of Bohemia be granted special privileged status within the> Czechoslovakian state. Is this September, 1938? Or 1992? Are these neo-Nazis?> Or “just plain ole’ Nazis”? Obviously, Czechoslovakia was once again broken in two. But the new Germany wasmuch subtler than Hitler, taking, perhaps, a page from Heinrich Himmler’splaybook:> Pressed to compensate Hitler’s Czech victims, Bonn raised the matter of> financial compensation for the property expropriated from 2.5 million Sudeten> Germans after the collapse of the Third Reich. (Is it live, or is it Memorex?)> After Czech courts nixed the idea, (Is it live, or is it Memorex?)> German finance minister Theo Waigel delivered a political broadside in which> he barely masked a threat to block Prague’s entry into the European Union. (Is it live, or is it Memorex?)> Czech officials were furious, but they could ill afford to cross swords with> Bonn. With German capital accounting for the lion’s share of foreign> investment in the Czech Republic, (Remember that clever German business plan to buy control of energy,transportation, telecommunications, and mass media? And whose plan does thatsound like?)> Bonn had considerable leverage over its neighbor. “The status of the Czech> Republic has gone from that of a Soviet satellite to that of a German> protectorate,” declared a commentator for the Prague Post.40 And well might the Prague Post have complained, for entry into theGerman-dominated European Union did indeed transform the Czech Republic,basically nothing more than the province of Bohemia-Moravia, from being aRussian satellite into a German economic protectorate for the second time in itsmodern history. Nor was the use of the word “protectorate” by the Prague Postaccidental, for as any Czech well knows, Heinrich Himmler, with Adolf Hitler’spermission, had transformed the entire country into theReichsprotektorat-Böhmen-Mahren (Reich Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia)under the exclusive jurisdiction of Himmler’s SS and its private SS economy,dominated by the large and powerful German cartels.All that was missing this time were the black uniforms and jackboots.b. Silesia, “Kaliningrad,” and Poland Poland watched all of this (and once again, is it live, or is it Memorex?) withgrowing uneasiness, as similar German maneuvers unfolded in Silesia, Pomerania,“and what used to be East Prussia.”41 Only this time, the covert moves were alittle more overt (is it live, or is it Memorex?):> Neo-Nazis from across the Oder-Neisse line sought to galvanize support for a> German takeover of large chunks of Polish territory. As in the Sudetenland,> neofascist agitation paralleled, and in some ways complemented – efforts by> Bonn-backed (expellee) groups that supplied revanchist propaganda to ethnic> German enclaves in Poland. Several neo-Nazi groups focused on Upper Silesia,> an area rich in coal, iron, and other natural resources42 This time, however, there was a change in tactics, as Neo-Nazi groups, withfunding from “somewhere,” openly purchased former German lands fromcash-strapped Poland, and established radio stations, printed newsletters,posted bilingual street signs in Polish and German, and changed the names ofvillages, once a sufficient German presence was reestablished, from their Polishnames back to their German ones.43In other words, the Neo-Nazis, with probable covert backing of the Bonngovernment, were deliberately creating a German minority in Poland buy buying upformerly German property in the formerly eastern provinces of the Reich.But why call Bonn’s role in this activity “probable and covert”? Answer: Polandnaturally protested these activities directly to Bonn. Bonn’s response was todemand that Warsaw give special rights and privileges to Volkdeutsche in Silesiaand Pomerania, and that they be allowed to carry German passports and vote inGerman elections. Warsaw “had little choice but to knuckle under” and caved into these demands.44 Yet, the German Bundestag refused to pass similarlegislation recognizing the special status of minorities within its borders.45Indeed, as has already been seen, Kohl and the opposition Social Democratscombined for a majority that amended the German constitution, abolishing itsprovision granting special asylum status to refugees. And as already been seen,German law enforcement officials turned a blind eye to the neo-Nazi-inspiredviolence of the Rostock incident. These policies quickly raised concerns – amongthe few who were actually following the post-unification attitudes of Germanyclosely– that Bonn was simply reviving some old traditions (with appropriateNazi and neo-Nazi embellishments), of German power politics and diplomacy.46 Andalmost nothing of these events or their significant implications were reportedin or analyzed by the American television media.Similar machinations befell the Russian oblast or province of Kaliningrad, whichwas but the northern portion of the former German province of East Prussia. TheGerman city of Königsberg had been renamed Kaliningrad by the Soviets, whoopenly annexed the province at the end of the war, and tried their best toRussianize it, transforming the port city into a major Baltic naval base for theSoviet Navy. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, and the dissolutionof the Warsaw Pact, the Kaliningrad oblast hangs precariously isolated betweenthe German-dominated Baltic-states and Poland.This time, Bonn was not so subtle, for it openly offered government financialincentives to any Germans, including relatives of the original Germaninhabitants of the city, to settle in “Kaliningrad.” The city soon “became amagnet for right-wing extremists,”47 who moved to the city in droves, bringing ahost of German corporate branch offices, including a newly opened branch ofDeutsche Bank, not far behind them. It is significant that the GermanGovernment, which has on the books of its legal code laws against legitimizingNazism or neo-Nazism nonetheless opened its treasury to such groups who wishedto move to “Kaliningrad.” The city has thus become a haven, almost a “Vatican,”for European-based neo-Nazi groups.c. Revising Versailles Yet Again: Germany, Croatia, and the Crack-up ofYugoslavia If Czechoslovakia, Poland, and even Russia were faced with invasions of formerGerman territories by Germans wielding not tanks, dive-bombers and heavyartillery but Deutschmarks, Yugoslavia was not so lucky. Yugoslavia soonsuccumbed to the rising tide of neo-fascist-inspired nationalism in the formerCommunist governments of Eastern Europe when a break-away Croatian Republic wasproclaimed in the former capital of the Nazi-puppet Croatian Ustashi regime’scapital, Zagreb. The breakup of that country, which the rest of the EuropeanUnion in concert with the United States attempted to prevent, was aided,abetted, and finally realized by the actions of one nation – Germany - when thatnation unilaterally recognized Croatia as an independent nation toward the endof 1991, scarcely two years after the reunification.48Despite the fact that the administration of President George Herbert Walker Bushcharged Germany with contributing to the swiftly deteriorating conditions andescalating civil war in Yugoslavia, Germany openly defied Washington’s protestsand a United Nations arms embargo to the newly recognized country, supplyingCroatia with almost “$320 million of military hardware – including MiG fighterjets,49 surface-to-air missiles, and late-model tanks.”50 Having created theBalkan crisis by its precipitous diplomatic unilateralism, Germany then cleverlyhid behind the auspices of NATO as Croatia and other minority republics formedfrom the former Yugoslavia requested NATO assistance to fight the militarilysuperior Serbia, which was fighting, after all, for its own territory! Thus,under the official diplomatic protection of the NATO alliance, Luftwaffe fighterbombers and fighters flew patrols over Croatia and Bosnia, preventing theSerbian air force from even penetrating their air space. When Croatia requestedGerman military personnel on its territory to enforce a peace accord betweenCroatia and Serbia in 1995, Germany only too readily agreed, and thus, for thefirst time since World War Two, the German military was deployed beyond theborders of Germany in significant numbers.517. The First Post-Unification Chief of the Bundeswehr and the “Mobile StrikeForce” Germany’s diplomatic and military maneuvers in the wake of unification disclosea further little-known fact: not only the sheer size and strength of theBundeswehr, but its ability to deploy significant numbers of troops outside ofGermany on a moment’s notice, a capability first suggested by the GSG-9 rescueof Lufthansa flight 181 and the alleged rescue of Andreas Strassmeir by the sameelite team of commands deployed to the U.S.A. But that was the tip of theiceberg for the post-unification German army:> General Klaus Naumann, the first military chief of reunified Germany, sought> to transform his army into an independent military power imbued “with a victor> mentality.”…Naumann was the driving force behind the Bundeswehr’s revamped> offensive strategy that entailed being “strategically alert rather than> reactively averting war.” Former German Fleet Admiral Elmar Schmälling> publicly accused Naumann of preparing an army of aggression modeled after its> Prussian predecessors.> The shift to an offensive military posture coincided with officially> sanctioned efforts to reevaluate military performance during the Nazi period.> Naumann insisted on modifying an old West German army decree that said a> “linkage of the Bundeswehr to (Hitler’s) Wehrmacht as an institution is> impossible.” Under Naumann’s command, such a linkage was not only possible but> desirable. The change in attitude was noted in Europäische Sicherheit> (European Security), a periodical closely associated with the German army,> which spoke of “finding common ground, fairly, with our fathers’ and> grandfathers’ generations, which in other nations is taken for granted.”> Henceforth, the Bundeswehr would not “separate itself from the roots which our> founders from the Wehrmacht so painstakingly and with exemplary personal> commitment sank in the earth, because these are roots which reach deep into> the German past and German military history.”> As part of its renewed emphasis on “tradition building,” the Bundeswehr> announced that the inclusion of all ranks (SS officers not excepted) on German> military gravestones was an absolute enecssity. This decision extended to war> cemeteries in central and Eastern Europe as well, according to General> Naumann, who put it country simple: “Those East European states which have> objected will have to have the thumbscrews put on them because they depend on> us for large-scale economic assistance.”52 General Naumann’s goals, however, were not limited merely to restoring symbolictraditions and connections to the Wehrmacht and the earlier imperial andPrussian armies.It was Naumann who in fact pressured Bonn to send his troops to Croatia andBosnia, to gain actual combat experience. It was an event that> marked a new phase in a gradual, step-by-step process orchestrated by German> leaders to expand their influence across the Continent. Critics warned that> the Bosnia assignment would open the door to future military intervention in> other areas – a development that Germany had prepared for by creating a highly> mobile, 50,000-strong strike force capable of rapid deployment in any part of> the world.53 Germany’s creation of this powerful strike force at the behest of GeneralNaumann means that it once again has joined the select club of those militarypowers that can project and deploy large amounts of well-equipped, highlymobile, and competently led troops anywhere to enforce its will.To reinforce this restoration of “old traditions,” on June 18, 1994, GeneralNaumann’s Bundeswehr troops celebrated the final departure of British, French,American, and Russian troops from Berlin with a “Prussian-style torchlightparade in front of Berlin’s Brandeburg Gate;” it was a celebration to which theBritish, French, Americans, and Russians, were not invited by the Germangovernment.54But this was, really, nothing new. When Hitler’s favorite Luftwaffe ace, and asignificant member of Bormann’s postwar Nazi International, Hans Ulrich Rudel,finally died in 1982, over two thousand people attended his funeral, “many ofwhom paid their respects by stretching out a single arm and in unison bellowingthe banned, pro-Nazi verses of ‘Deutschland über Alles.’”55 As they did so, twoLuftwaffe fighter jets flew over the site, dipping their wings low in salute ofthe former ace.Rudel, as we shall see in the next section, was a prominent figure in thepostwar corporate machinations of the Nazi International.image [images/00030.jpg] Former Luftwaffe Ace Hans Ulrich Rudel, During World War Two D. Deep History and “Deep Politics”: Connecting the Dots If the reader has had thus far that sinking, nausea-inducing uneasy feeling that“we’ve been here before, but what’s the connection?” then it is now time toconnect a few more dots to make the postwar machinations of the NaziInternational, German reunification and its strangely “coincidental” parallelwith Adolf Hitler’s own foreign policies a little clearer.1. The New Corporate Ambassadors: Rudel and Skorzeny as Bormann’s Nazi PartyLiaison Officers to Siemens and Krupp It will be recalled that one of the mechanisms Bormann put into place in hispostwar flight capital plan to maintain a powerful Nazi influence over postwarGerman corporations was a “liaison” officer inside various technical researchinstitutes that German corporations were to establish in foreign countries. Twosuch liaison officers were undoubtedly Luftwaffe ace Hans Ulrich Rudel and SScommando and colonel Otto Skorzeny, both soldiers favorites of Hitler, and bothardent disciples and devotees of the Nazi cause. Skorzeny indeed served as arepresentative for the Krupp munitions firm and other German firms to Perón’sArgentina, negotiating lucrative contracts for German firms in that country.56Similarly, Rudel acted as a similar corporate ambassador for the giant Germanelectrical firm of Siemens in Argentina, where Rudel made his home for yearsafter the war. Other former Werhmacht officers and Nazi bureaucrats foundsimilar post-war employment: recall only the Egyptian escapades of Skorzeny,Voss, Remer, Schacht and others.2.Gehlen: The Key Connection of the Scenario But how was all this activity – including the sudden “populist” upwelling forGerman reunification and the simultaneous appearance of a “plan” forreunification in Kohl’s government, the rapid penetration of German economicinfluence into Eastern Europe, the funding of neo-Nazi “settlers” in formerGerman territories, all accomplished? How was Germany able to draw on resourcesbehind the Iron Curtain and in the West to pull this off, with scarcely a peepfrom London, Paris, Moscow, or Washington?One need only consider the implications of the deal struck between Allen Dullesand Nazi military intelligence chief Reinhard Gehlen and the subsequent historyof Gehlen’s organization to see how it could have been pulled off and plannedwell in advance before the war’s end. In the last chapter we already encounteredthe Nazi propaganda bureaucrat Grobbe, who worked his way up to become head ofthe Soviet Foreign Ministry’s Arab affairs desk. Meanwhile, the CIA wasemploying Gehlen’s spies, many of whom were simultaneously members in thepostwar neo-Nazi cells both in the eastern and western zones of Germany andEurope, organizations and cells that despised the United States.57 It iswell-known that Gehlen’s organization was deeply penetrated by the Soviet KGB,and that many of its agents were “turned” into double agents.The trouble with double agents, of course, is that their loyalty is always inquestion, only in the case of Gehlen’s organization, that loyalty neverinitially belonged to the United States at all; it belonged to Nazi Germany. Itis thus quite possible that while the KGB thought it had “turned” many ofGehlen’s agents against the west, those agents may have been able to pull off aconvincing performance for their Soviet “masters” because their real allegianceremained where it started: Nazism.If this scenario sounds implausible, consider only the intelligence needs of thevast scenario of German reunification itself: How did Kohl’s government knowthat the Soviet Union, United States, Great Britain, and France, would notoppose his unilateral decision to press unification on East Germany? How did heknow the populist uprisings in that country could be channeled into “populardemands” for reunification? For that matter, how did German industry penetrateso quickly into the strategic economic interests of an only very recentlyCommunist Eastern Europe? How were neo-Nazi cells so quickly able to organizethemselves, move into and buy former German lands in former German provinces inPoland and elsewhere? All this requires an extensive intelligence network andlots of money.And if, as many researchers have proven, Gehlen’s organization – the parent ofthe West German Bundesnachrichten-dienst – was so riddled with Soviet KGB moles,then imagine the nightmarish scenario that those “double” agents were in fact“triple” agents, taking orders neither from the West, nor the East, butultimately playing both sides for fools in a careful and delicate and patientdance, and taking their orders from the hidden directorate of the “ThirdPosition”. At its height, Gehlen’s organization had more than four thousandagents inside of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and it was the de factonucleus of NATO intelligence itself, supplying almost “two thirds” of all ofNATO’s intelligence on the Warsaw Pact.58 To put it succinctly, the German BNDwas, and to a certain extent, is NATO intelligence.If there is any doubt that this scenario has a high degree of probability,consider only this fact: when the Soviet Union collapsed, there was an outcry inthe United States against the CIA, because it had failed to predict that acollapse was even imminent. But West Germany, as is by now evident, waswell-prepared not only for its own reunification with East Germany, but rapidlymoved to exploit the situation in the former Warsaw Pact nations. Was thisreally, therefore, a failure of American intelligence, or a failure of itsGerman ally to share all the intelligence it had gathered from the descendent ofGehlen’s “KGB-mole-ridden” organization? If the Soviets were so effective at themanipulation of West German intelligence, why was West Germany the only“western” power fully prepared for the Soviet collapse?There is historical precedent for this scenario.It is now well-known that Gehlen’s organization, after the conclusion of thenotorious deal with Allen Dulles that transformed it into the operational Sovietdesk in the early days of the CIA, deliberately fed disinformation to the U.S.A.in order precisely to whip up American fears of Soviet military capabilities andintentions, and accordingly, drive the American military build up and fan thefuels of an increasing debt load. Martin A. Lee sums it up this way:> Was Gehlen merely improvising as he fabricated dire reports about Red Army> machinations? Or was this part of a conscious effort to bind U.S. foreign> policy to the Cold War for his own purposes? Gehlen’s strategy was based on a> rudimentary equation – the colder the Cold War got, the more political space> for Hitler’s heirs to maneuver. He realized that the Org could flourish only> under Cold War conditions; as an institution it was therefore committed to> perpetuating the Soviet-American conflict.59 If it was possible for Gehlen’s “Org” to slip disinformation to the U.S.A., evenif it came from “turned” Soviet double agents within his own network, by thesame token, it would have been possible to slip the Soviets disinformation aboutAmerican strength and intentions through the same “double” agents in theespionage version of the Nazi geopolitical “Third Position.”The strongest evidence that this scenario is exactly what happened is the factthat Germany was the only power in the world fully prepared to move quickly oncethe Soviet crackup finally came; such preparation requires accurate and detailedintelligence on the ground, organization, and financing. By co-optinganti-Communist bias in American intelligence that was beginning to emerge at theend of the Second World War, Gehlen’s deal with Dulles effectively closed-downany potential de-nazification of postwar German intelligence and neutralized thepotential threat posed by American intelligence. Thus, “by bankrolling Gehlen,the Agency had unknowingly laid itself open to manipulation by a foreignintelligence service that was riddled with Soviet spies.”60 While that may betrue, it was also riddled at a much deeper level with Nazi agendas andintentions. Indeed, Martin Lee recognizes that this was the real purpose of theOrganization to begin with, and the real motivation for the deal with Dulles,for the ultimate objective “of their subtly conceived efforts was the survival,and ultimately the revival, of the Nazi movement.”61 Gehlen and hisBundesnachrichtendienst, in other words, were an integral component in themachinery of Bormann’s Nazi International, designed to gather information, andsmuggle crucial personnel to safe havens in Latin America and the Middle East.Thus, the manipulation of postwar circumstances began even before the war ended,with the division of the technological spoils themselves, for consider, whenOtto Skorzeny began broadcasting public appeals for Germans and loyal Nazis tojoin him in the nonexistent National Redoubt,62 Allied intelligence waslistening, and accordingly, directed its armies southward to the Harz, theAustrian Alps, and Bohemian Czechoslovakia, where they found, not a redoubt, butlots of technical “goodies” including the scientists that made them.In this, Allen Dulles and American intelligence were quite simply, and utterly,duped, for he> Continued to entertain a procession of Nazi raconteurs bearing misleading> gifts. One of those who primed his pump was the wily SS Lieutenant Colonel> Wilhelm (“Willi”) Höttl, who later acknowledged that he had hyped rumors of an> impending bitter-end battle in the icy highlands. “Phony blueprints were drawn> up and intelligence was leaked to the Americans, who seemed to be most> prepared to believe such a romantic military plot,” Höttl recounted.63 In other words, it was German military intelligence and psychological operationsthat were driving the American Third Army of General George S. Patton straightfor the vast secret weapons treasure trove of General Hans Kammler, whilesimultaneously, German troops put up a fierce defense of Breslau in Silesiaagainst the Russians, to allow time to get their most highly classified project,the Bell, safely away from Russian and Allied hands and out of Europe, and whileMartin Bormann was manipulating his and Müller’s transfer to the U-234, andtheir safe passage to Spain under the cover of the security they knew would beaccorded to the U-boat by an America which desperately needed its enricheduranium-235 and infrared proximity fuses for its own atom bomb.The Nazi International had not only manipulated the conflict between Egypt andIsrael, armed Egypt, arranged its alliance with the Soviet Union, trained theGrand Mufti’s fedayeen, armed Arafat, sold production facilities for weapons ofmass destruction to Saddam Hussein, sponsored the “third positionism” of JuanPerón, hosted international terrorist summits in Nationalist Spain, but it hadmanipulated the end of World War Two and a clever division of technologicalspoils between the United States and the Soviet Union while keeping “the reallygood stuff” for itself, driving each superpower into a financially bankruptingarms race; it had not only orchestrated the drive of General Patton’s Third Armyinto the very heart of Kammler’s secret research facilities, but its neo-Nazidescendants – if indeed they really are neo - and not just plain old - Nazis –had co-opted the populist uprisings in East Germany while West Germanintelligence conveniently gave Kohl’s government the green light forreunification……if this “coincidental” picture is not clear enough by now, then stop reading,and go no further, for the dialectical manipulation of conflict, the penetrationinto strategic industries in Europe as well as the unification of Europe itselfunder German dominance, prominent as all of these agendas were for the NaziInternational, were nevertheless not the limits of its vision.Those limits are represented by the Bell project, where it likely went, and whatit implied about Nazi intentions and designs, for they were not merely confinedto this world…1 Timothy Garton Ash, In Europe’s Name (New York: Random House, 1993), p. 406.2 Martin A.

Lee, The Beast Reawakens, p. 250.38 The German and French influence in Hussein’s archaeological projects raisesother questions, not the least of which is that this influence has never beenquestioned or challenged or even adequately investigated. Michael Bogdanos, theAmerican Marine colonel who led the U.S.’s official investigation of the BaghdadMuseum looting, never once mentions in his popular account of the investigation,The Thieves of Baghdad, the explicit and specific catalogue of what the variousexpeditions in Iraq had uncovered, nor what Germany and France might actuallyknow or have known about the non- inventoried items at the museum. Perhaps hedoes not do so for reasons of security and the protection of priceless Iraqinational treasures that yet need to be recovered. But it is also entirelypossible, despite his forensic competency and the quality of his recoveryefforts in Iraq, that he does not know everything. In view of the Franco-Germanarchaeological presence in the country prior to the Anglo-American invasion,certain obvious questions are raised about the potential hidden purposes of thatpresence as well as the potential hidden purposes of the Anglo-Americaninvasion. And in the light of the context of the political and economicinitiatives undertaken by Germany since the reunification, these questions onlyloom larger in importance.Over the course of many radio interviews, people have asked this author what Ihave thought about the looting of the Baghdad Museum, and I have alwaysresponded that I thought aspects of it reflected an “inside” or “professional”job. This is a view equally shared by Bogdanos in his book. Bodganos, however,argues that the “insiders” and “professionals” were primarily art thieves intentupon making a killing in the lucrative black market antiquities trade. Somealternative researchers such as Jim Marrs have suggested that in fact thethieves may have been “our” insiders and professionals, intent upon stealing thesecrets of lost technology and knowledge, and not intent upon merely selling thepriceless artifacts on the international antiquities black market. But thepre-invasion heavy presence of French and German archaeological teams in thecountry coupled with the continued presence of the German BND in the countryequally argues that it may have been someone else’s inside job. If indeed therewere “hidden purposes” in play in the Anglo-American invasion beyond thepublicly-stated concerns about Weapons of Mass Destruction and internationalterrorism, then someone else’s theft of uncatalogued Iraqi antiquities from theBaghdad Museum might be one of the hidden reasons for the continuedAnglo-American occupation of the country. On this reading, both we, our Britishallies, and the Germans, are still looking for something in a quiet and covert“antiquities war.”39 Martin A. Lee, The Beast Reawakens, p. 251.40 Martin A.

And Now, a Word from President Perón… President and generalissimo Juan Domingo Perón was nothing if not intenselypatriotic and flamboyant. His influence and effect on the development ofArgentina as a regional power was lasting, and endures to such an extent that ifone says “South American dictators” many people to this day think first ofPerón. Few people realize, however, the depth of his relationship with thepost-war Nazis or the degree of cooperation and funding he gave them. Even fewerpeople realize what some aspects of that cooperation and funding portended andrevealed about the Nazi International’s postwar intentions and designs, forthose intentions and designs were nothing less than grand.On Monday, April 2, 1951, Time magazine ran an article called “Peron’s Atom.”The news was - pardoning the pun - nothing less than explosive, if true:> Juan Perón called his newsmen in last week for a very special announcement.> With elaborate ostentation, members of the foreign press corps were barred.> What he had to say, Perón explained, was only for his own people. His news:> Argentine scientists, using only relatively cheap Argentine materials, had on> Feb. 16 produced “controlled liberation of atomic energy,” i.e., an atomic> explosion.> “The new Argentina,” explained Perón, had decided that it was not “worth the> trouble to copy nuclear fission.” Instead, “contrary to what was done in> foreign experiments, Argentine technicians worked on the basis of> thermonuclear reactions, which are identical with those whereby the sun> releases atomic energy.” The successful experiment had been conducted at the> government atomic plant on Huemul Island, in the Andean lake of Naheul Huapi,> some 900 miles southwest of Beunos Aires. It required neither uranium nor> plutonium. “With the seriousness and veracity which is my custom,” Perón> assured his people that his cut-rate atomic energy would be used “solely for> power plants, smelters and other industrial establishments.”2 The generalissimo, it seemed, was after the power of the stars and of hydrogenbombs, the first of which would be detonated a little over a year after Perón’sannouncement.But then, in the very next paragraphs, the article went on to suggest a darkshadow casting a familiar and sinister swastika shape over the Argentineproject, making it not so much Argentine, but Nazi:> Made in Argentina. At the President’s side was Dr. Ronald Richter, a plump,> Austrian-born physicist (German University of Prague), who has been associated> with Argentina’s atomic program ever since it was begun all of nine months> ago. Only nine months!?!? If so, then Dr. Richter had succeeded in a matter of a fewweeks of moving Argentina from regional power to the first thermonuclear powerin the world! But more on this in a moment. The article continues:> Through an air force interpreter, the doctor announced in rich Austrian> German: “What we have accomplished is strictly Argentine - it is infinitely> superior to the system used in the U.S… For some time now, Argentina has known> the secret of the hydrogen bomb (but) I have always found a refusal on General> Perón’s part to make use of this secret.”> Later, Dr. Richter answered a few questions.

Well, said the doctor, that would depend on whether there was a> storm at the time. Had it been heard at San Carlos de Bariloche 6 ½ miles> away? No.3 Dr. Richter’s “controlled fusion explosion,” whatever it was, was showing thesigns of a serious credibility problem.image [images/00032.jpg] Dr. Ronald Richter4 According to Richter’s files at the U.S. National Archives and RecordsAdministration, the Washington Post also weighed in with some heavy weightcritics and skeptics, and some suspicions about Richter’s possible Nazibackground. In an article entitled “Peron is Irked by Atom ‘Find’ Disbelievers,”the Post quotes Richter as stating “I want to make it clear that I was never aNazi.”5 But three days later the Post ran a short column that called intoquestion Richter’s anti-Nazi disclaimer:> Tried to Get Richter Into U.S., Engineer Says> SAN FRANCISCO, March 27 (1951) (U.P.). – Elmer G. Stahl, a utilities engineer,> today said he knows Dr. Ronald W.

I wrote everybody from the President on down…”> He said he failed because the scientist had been a member of the Nazi Party.> Richter then went to Argentina, Stahl said, and the two corresponded…6 image [images/00033.jpg] March 25, 1951 Washington Post Article with Richter’s Denials of Nazi PartyMembership In the light of the fact that the U.S. government brought over several Naziscientists with a much more dubious past than Richter, Stahl’s observation nowseems naïve.But there were weightier skeptics that were brought in to discredit Richter. Inanother article on March 25, 1951, inthe Washington Post, none other than Drs.Werner Heisenberg and Otto Hahn – two of Nazi Germany’s most famous atomicscientists – weighed in with their own carefully worded skepticism:> …Germany’s two top atomic scientists termed the Argentine claim “fantastic.”> Dr. Werner Heisenberg, Nobel Prize winner in physics in 1932 and now director> of the Max Planck Institute at Goettingen, said in a telephone interview from> Frankfurt:> “I do no believe that at the present time something new in atomic research has> been developed in Argentina which United Stated scientists did not know long> ago.”> Atomic research in Argentina is only in its beginning and the country is> training young scientists and building institutes, Heisenberg asserted.> Dr. Otto Hahn, president of the Max Planck Association, which carries on> theoretical research in physics, agreed with Dr. Heisenberg. Hahn is another> Nobel Prize winner, and received the award in 1944 for his work in chemistry.> Both said that no German atom scientists of whom they knew have emigrated to> Argentina…7 In other words, neither Heisenberg nor Hahn had ever heard of Richter, an oddclaim, since both allegedly worked on Germany’s atom bomb. Even odder is why, inthe face of the then well-established Allied Legend about German nuclearengineering incompetence, the word of two “atom bomb bunglers” such asHeisenberg and Hahn would carry any weight at all.image [images/00034.jpg] March 25, 1951 Washington Post Article With Heisenberg’s and Hahn’s Claim Neverto Have Heard of Richter Of course, Richter’s claims were fantastic on the face of it, for on the basisof the conventional physics of the day, of course, a thermonuclear explosion hadto be triggered by an atom bomb, acting as a kind of nuclear “fuse” to attainthe extreme pressures and heat gradients necessary to initiate a thermonuclearfusion reaction. Setting off even a “small” atom bomb to fire off a “small”hydrogen bomb would certainly have been a noisy event, easily hearable at thetown of San Carlos de Bariloche which was, as the article itself offered, only 6½ miles away.Either Richter’s explosion was so small, and brought about by completely unknownand off-the-books physics principles, or Richter was a fraud, and had defraudedthe Perón regime. Time magazine opted for the latter:> Words & Baloney. While no one would deny that the Argentines might have> produced some sort of laboratory-scale nuclear reaction, non-Argentine> scientists were skeptical. “This is an interesting series of words,” said an> (Atomic Energy Commission) physicist, “but it means nothing to me.” Said Dr.> Ralph E. Lapp, onetime chief of the Office of Naval Research: “I know what> that other material is that the Argentine’s are using. It’s baloney.” Snapped> Juan Perón: “I am not interested in what the U.S. or any other country> thinks.”> But Perón had cunningly timed his announcement to explode just as the foreign> ministers of all 21 Latin American countries gathered in Washington in> conference. If it did not convince them that there might be more than one> atomic power in the hemisphere, it at least distracted them from the subject> of the forced closing of La Prensa by Dictator Perón. As the delegates settled> down this week to hammer out a hemisphere defense policy against Communist> aggression, they kept one ear cocked for more offstage noises of Juan Perón.8 In other words, almost as soon as Perón and Richter made the announcement, itwas being denounced in the United States by heavy hitters from its Atomic EnergyCommission.And given the nature of the claims themselves, who can blame them?In any case, Perón, never one to let “the seriousness and veracity which was hiscustom” to go unchallenged, had nonetheless been publicly embarrassed by theAmerican response, an embarrassment made all the more insufferable because Perónhimself had obviously timed the announcement carefully in order to catch theconference’s American hosts off guard and unprepared.By this time, Perón had of course been privately consulting with his ownscientists, who doubtless assured him that the American perspective on thematter represented sound science, and that something was, indeed, wrong with hisatomic project in Bariloche. Determined to get to the bottom of the mystery,Perón appointed a commission to investigate the matter and report back to himpersonally.And this, as they say, is where it gets really interesting…B. The Argentine High Commission’s Report and Dr. Richter’s Strange Behavior The members of this commission were two engineers,9 a Catholic priest from SanMiguel observatory,10 and a “Captain Beninson,” whose role, service branch,nationality, and role in the commission is otherwise unspecified in its finalreport. Heading up this committee was one Dr. José Antonio Balseiro, who at thattime was a mere 32 years old, and who had to be recalled from England where hehad gone to study nuclear physics.11 As the official introductory note to Dr.Balseiro’s report from the Argentine National Atomic Energy Commission states,“one of the conditions set out for the inspection was that the reports should besubmitted individually.”12 President Perón, in other words, was taking nochances that there would be collusion among the commission members.The result, as the official modern introduction to the report informs us, wasthat “the outcome of this inspection was the Commission, 1988, Nuclear Energy:History: Argentine: 621.039(091)(82), from the introduction. decision by thegovernment to put an end to the project.”13 But the official introductioncontinues with an intriguing set of comments: “A young unknown scientist (Dr.Balseiro) had to inform the Nation’s President that he had been cheated: hispersonal assessment of Richter is so precise and deep as the technical reportand at the same time gives a revealing and fascinating image of Balseiro.”14 Asfar as the modern Argentine Nuclear Energy Commission is concerned, then, Dr.Balseiro’s assessment of the project remained true: it was nothing but aswindle, and Dr. Richter was nothing but a clever con man.But the report itself, and in Dr. Balseiro’s own words to boot, calls intoquestion this assessment. In order to see how, we shall present it in detail,compare it to the original Time magazine reportage of the story, and thenexamine the anomalous behavior that the report records.Dr. Balseiro begins innocently enough:> To: The Most Excellent (Excelentisimo) President of the Nation, General of the> Army, General (Don) Juan D. Perón.> I have the honor of presenting for the consideration of His Excellency the> President, the report that has been requested from me about the experiments> witnessed during the visit carried out between 5 to 8 September of the current> year (1952) to the Atomic Energy Plant of the Isla Huemul.> I declare before His Excellency the president that the facts contained in this> report are exactly as observed, that the interpretations and opinions rendered> are faithful expressions of my honest understanding and knowledge, being> expressed after detailed reflection and study.> I salute his Excellency the President with my highest esteem, > /s/> José A. Balseiro> Buenos Aires 15 September 1952.15Let us pause and note some obvious things:> 1) Dr. Balseiro actually visited the atomic laboratories of Dr. Richter and> witnessed some experiments that were performed over a year after the initial> announcement that was recorded in the Time magazine article;> 2) The atomic facilities were located in the remote region of Bariloche in> southwest Argentina, near the Chilean border in the foothills of the Andes> mountains;> 3) The facilities were furthermore located on the remote island of Huemul. In> other words, someone wished to make sure that whatever research was being> conducted, that it was being conducted as far away from prying eyes as> possible. This could mean that the research was either fraudulent, and that> the fraud was being concealed by the project’s remoteness, the view undertaken> by the report, or it could mean that the research was highly covert and> sensitive. Finally, let us recall one more thing, from the Time magazine article:> 4) The project head, Dr. Ronald Richter, was not Argentine at all, but> Austrian, and was educated at the German University of Prague. Needless to> say, Time magazine said nothing whatsoever about what this might portend.With these points in mind, on to Dr. Balseiro’s report itself. Balseiro beginshis report by observing that “the basis upon which Dr. Richter’s experimentsrest are the two known nuclear reactionsimage [images/00035.jpg] image [images/00036.jpg]16 That is, in the first case, the fusion of a lithium-7 atom with a hydrogen atomwill produce two helium atoms plus an enormous quantity of electromagneticenergy (in the form of an x-ray and gamma ray burst) of 17.28 million electronvolts of energy. In the second case, the fusion of two deuterium atoms (atoms ofhydrogen with an extra neutron in the nucleus) will produce an atom of tritium(an atom of hydrogen with two extra neutrons in the nucleus) plus a free neutronplus a burst of electromagnetic energy of 3.18 million electron volts. So far,so good, the physics is straightforward.After a page or two of equations and standard physical analysis, Dr. Balseirocuts right to the heart of the matter. Dr. Richter, who claimed apparently tohave achieved fusion reactions in a plasma via an intense electric arc, couldnot possibly have done so, for the physics – at least, in the conventionalmodels demonstrably well-known to Dr. Balseiro – simply could not and would notsustain such a reaction nor Dr. Richter’s claims:> For 1% of the nuclei to have enough energy to start the reaction, we need> therefore, an initial temperature of at least 40 millions of degrees Kelvin.> As a comparison, it is of relevance to recall that the temperature in the> hottest zone of a voltaic discharge arc does not reach higher than 4,000 K and> that the highest instantaneous temperatures reached in the laboratory by> Kapitza are of the order of 100,000 K.17 In other words, by the standard model of thermonuclear fusion, where stars aregigantic hydrogen bombs in states of perpetual detonation due to their highgravity and heat gradients, and where the fusion chain reaction of a hydrogenbomb can only be set off by the extremely high heat of an atomic bomb explosion,Dr. Richter’s claims were like the later claims of Drs. Pons and Fleischmann tohave achieved “cold” fusion reactions (again by employing relatively simple“electrolysis” equipment): the claims could not be true because the model ofthermonuclear fusion known to standard physics made such claims and observationsimpossible.1. Dr. Richter’s Claims to Have Found a New Principleof Physical, Nuclear Action It is at this precise juncture that Dr. Balseiro introduces Dr. Richter’s actualclaims. It is worth citing Balseiro in full, in order to appreciate thestrangely synchronous connection to Pons and Fleischmann’s claims almost fourdecades later and the strangely parallel reactions of the scientific communityto them:> The analysis made above, shows the impossibility, according to present> knowledge, of achieving in the laboratory this type of nuclear reactions> (sic). Dr. Richter, however, claims on this point to have discovered a set of> phenomena that make invalid the type of reasoning exposed above. Furthermore,> he insists these new phenomena discovered by him, constitute the basic secret> of the process of thermonuclear reaction.> It is not possible to foresee to what class of phenomena Dr. Richter refers to> (sic), in particular because their existence cannot fail to contradict some of> the basic knowledge which is accepted at present. In the first place, if the> (Lithium-Hydrogen reaction) would occur at temperatures substantially below 20> (thousand electron volts) this would imply a fundamental change in our present> knowledge of nuclear structure and quantum mechanics.18 These two paragraphs contain all the mystery that is the Huemul project, forthere are only two logical ways to interpret the project and Dr. Richter’sextraordinary claims.The first is that Richter was, quite simply, a fraud at best or an incompetentwho had misunderstood his laboratory experiments, or who was dealing withcorrupted samples, at worst. If this sounds a bit like the reaction to Pons andFleischmann, that’s because it is almost exactly the same reaction! Dr.Balseiro, examining Richter’s claims to have discovered and observed a newprinciple, rejects those claims and observations as being contradictory to knownscientific principles and theory. And what upsets Balseiro is quite clear: ifRichter had discovered such a principle it would upset a great deal of acceptedprinciples of quantum mechanics.But the second possibility is that Dr. Richter had indeed found something,something not explicable by the then (or even today’s) standard theoreticalmodels. It is indeed this second possibility that makes the interpretation ofthe remainder of Dr. Balseiro’s report extremely interesting, for as we shallnow see, some of Dr. Richter’s and his associates’ behavior are just downrightinexplicable if indeed they thought they were perpetrating a fraud, or if indeedthey are trying to preserve the project itself.2. The Nature of the Principle: Precession Just what principle had Dr. Richter allegedly discovered? According to Dr.Balseiro,> Dr. Richter has stated that the control device of the thermonuclear device is> based on the resonance obtained between the Larmor precession frequency –> which originates in the interaction of the magnetic field acting on the> intrinsic magnetic moment of the (lithium-7) atom – and that of the> oscillating magnetic field produced by a radio frequency generator. The figure> given for the constant magnetic field intensity is 15,000 Gauss. On the other> hand the device used by Dr. Richter does not produce the nuclear reaction in a> vacuum but at atmospheric pressure. Under these conditions, and with the value> of magnetic field that has been given, it is possible to show that the control> mechanism, whatever its form, can not be achieved using the effect> mentioned.19 Once again, after a couple of pages of very straightforward mathematics, Dr.Balseiro demonstrates the impossibilities of Richter’s claims: “The resultobtained,” he concludes, “is that the enormous number of hits that the atom of(lithium) suffers at the operating conditions,” i.e., under normal atmosphericconditions, “makes impossible any sort of control mechanism based on theprinciple mentioned by Dr. Richter.”203. Dr. Richter’s Extremely Anomalous Behavior But there was an even more fundamental problem with Dr. Richter’s claims, andBalseiro minces no words explaining what it is:> Apart from the theoretical arguments mentioned, it is necessary to add that> even though a radio-frequency generator exists inside the reaction chamber,> this has never been functional during the experimental demonstration.> Furthermore, apart from the electromagnet generating the constant magnetic> field, there is nowhere near the reaction area any device that could generate> the oscillating magnetic field that might produce a resonance with the Larmor> precession frequency as Dr. Richter proposes.21 In other words, Dr. Balseiro has now proposed an astonishing thing, and it isnot the last time his report will document some extremely unusual behavior forscientists under the pressure of having to justify their research, for note whatDr. Balseiro’s statements imply:> 1) Dr. Richter and his associates either performed the “proof of concept”> experiments for Dr. Balseiro’s commission under circumstances when a vital> piece of the equipment, the radio frequency generator, by Richter’s own> explanations of the principles of physics he believed to be involved, was> either broken down and not functioning at all, or that he – Dr Richter – and> his associates failed to turn on. In either case, their behavior is> inexplicable if they are faced with the survival of their project, for it> guarantees that their experiments will fail, that they will be exposed as> frauds, and that their funding will cease.> 2) Yet another vital piece of equipment – any device that could generate an> oscillating magnetic field – was completely absent from the area and thus no> “precession frequency,” the very basis Dr. Richter had proposed as a> theoretical explanation for whatever phenomenon he had discovered, could be> generated! In other words, if one piece of equipment was either malfunctioning or simplynot turned on, one could perhaps rationalize Richter’s and his team’s behavioras a natural human oversight. But when yet another vital piece of equipment,necessary to the demonstration of the phenomenon for General Perón’s inspectorsis nowhere near the experiment itself, then the chances that Richter’s behaviorwas accidental diminishes considerably.Was the swindler trying to buy more time? Why would Richter have made a specificclaim for a process that required such equipment, and then not use it inperforming the experiment for the Argentine inspectors, thus guaranteeing theexperiments would fail, and his project and its funding would be shut down? Ifthe swindler was trying to buy more time, his behavior is decidedly counter tohis purpose, since the experiments he did perform under these adverse conditionscould hardly hope to satisfy the Argentine scientists and authorities. So, whatwas he doing? How does one rationalize Richter’s extremely odd behavior?4. A New Anomaly and the Argentine Advisory ReviewCommission’s own Anomalous Behavior The mystery only deepens considerably as one reads further and further into Dr.Balseiro’s report. Under the third header of his report, a section entitled“Experiments and checks performed,” Dr. Balseiro records the followinginteresting exchange between the visiting Argentine scientists and commissionmembers, and Dr. Richter:> The nuclear reaction of (lithium and hydrogen) produces two (alpha) particles> with a mean energy of 8.5 (million electron volts). Since the reaction takes> place, according to the device shown by Dr. Richter, in air at atmospheric> pressure and in the region of the voltaic arc, the (alpha) particles must be> stopped in the air, because their penetrating power at 8.5 MeV is only a few> centimeters. It would be then, very difficult to verify that the nuclear> reaction is actually produced by trying to determine if (alpha) particles are> present. A possibility for such verification consists in identifying the> presence of soft gamma radiation coming from the acceleration irradiation> (brehmstrahlung) emitted when the (alpha) particles pass near the (hydrogen> and oxygen) nuclei. Dr. Richter relies on Geiger counters for this purpose.> When the device operates, these counters do actually record a large quantity> of pulses. However, in the experiment carried out on Friday, September 5, a> monitoring counter which the Advisory Review Commission took to the site, did> not register the presence of any gamma radiation.> When confronted with this fact Dr. Richter suggested on the Saturday afternoon> that during Sunday he would make preparations so that on Monday morning he> could perform the nuclear reaction 2H+2H+3He+n with the purpose of verifying> the presence through the use of foils that could be radiologically activated> by these neutrons. Once the experiment was performed, there was no way in> which the reaction could be verified; none of the foils was activated.> In view of this result it was asked of Dr. Richter that he repeat the> experiment of the (lithium-7 and hydrogen) reaction performed. The results of these new experiments were more than a little mystifying, for thenormally confident Dr. Balseiro for once does not comment at any great lengthupon them. Here’s what his report actually states:> The Advisory Review Commission had taken equipment to perform independent> checks. Some of them were made before this last experiment. It was confirmed:> a) That the Geiger Counters which Dr. Richter has in the reaction chamber, in> the way in which they are installed, are not sensitive to penetrating gamma> radiation of a standard source of Radium.In other words, Dr. Richter was once again either a swindler or an incompetentby installing his measurement equipment in such an irrational fashion, or, onceagain, his behavior is deliberately designed to make the experiment fail andcast the whole operation under suspicion. If the latter, then it is the thirdinstance in which Dr. Richter’s equipment was either malfunctioning, ordeliberately placed in such a way it would do his experiments absolutely no goodwhatsoever!Dr. Balseiro continues:> b) Only after removing the protective shielding present do they show a weak> activity before this standard sample.Note carefully what Balseiro has just actually said: Dr. Richter placed hismeasuring equipment behind radioactive shielding where its role as a detectorand verifier of his experiments would absolutely be bound to fail. If Dr.Richter was a swindler, then his behavior could hardly be more anomalous, for heis at every turn trying to draw the Argentines’ attention to the swindle! Thequestion is, why? And put yourself in Juan Perón’s shoes for a moment, for whileall of Dr. Balseiro’s scientific learning and mathematics may have been lost onthe generalissimo, Dr. Richter’s strangely anomalous behavior would mostdefinitely not have been lost to him; it would have stuck out like a sore thumb.The report continues:> c) The same source placed in the vicinity of the counters taken by the Review> Commission produced a strong activity in them.> d) That having the voltaic arc in operation while there were no Lithium salts> or hydrogen and therefore being no possibility of the nuclear reaction to> occur, the counters used by Dr. Richter showed a large activity.> e) That with the device working under the conditions which Dr. Richter claims> that produce the thermonuclear reaction, the response of the counters had the> same characteristics than in the above case.> f) The counters of the Advisory Commission in the cases d) and e) showed a> weak activity. This without doubt comes from a penetrating radiation, as> indicated by the fact that they worked also in the case specified as d).22 But what samples are being spoken of here? Is it radium that Dr. Richter hadavailable? Radium that the Commission brought with it? Is the sample beingtested in Richter’s reaction chamber? Or is something else altogether, assuggested in case “d”, at work?Dr Balseiro, normally so careful and precise, is here for once very vague. Andnotably, even when there are no lithium salts or hydrogen present in thechamber, “the device working under the conditions which Dr. Richter claims thatproduce the thermonuclear reaction, the response of the counters had the samecharacteristics,” namely, “a large activity.” Even the counters brought by theAdvisory Commission showed “a weak activity.” Oddly, Dr. Balseiro, who couldhave written all these things off as simply “background radiation,” a standardexplanation in such cases, did not do so. One was in the presence of a very realanomaly, and notably, the Commission completely ignores it.And observe something else: Dr. Balseiro’s six-point commentary occurs after itwas agreed that Richer would re-perform the lithium-7 and hydrogen fusionexperiments. The presumptive explanation, then, is that the counter-readingsreferred to here in this section of the report may have been taken immediatelyafter the lithium and hydrogen was pumped from the reaction chamber. Thereadings remained present when the presumed “thermonuclear source” for them wasnot. Yet another anomaly that is quietly passed over by the Advisory ReviewCommission and Dr. Balseiro. But this may be, as we shall eventually see, a verysignificant clue into what Dr. Richter was actually up to, and what his projectwas actually investigating.5. The Heavy Water Production Facility and Odder Behavior fromDr Richter and His Team The weirdest behavior exhibited by Dr. Richter and his team was recorded towardthe end of the report, as the Argentine Commission drew near the end of itsvisit to Huemul Island near Bariloche. This occurred when “Dr. Richter showed afacility for the production of heavy water, which is in charge of Dr. Ehrenberg.He mentioned that in spite of its modest appearance great results have beenobtained with it.”23 Needless to say, the Argentine scientists asked the logicalquestion, confronted by these claims. Dr. Balseiro records the strange behaviorthat occurred next with his customary exactitude:> When Dr. Ehrenberg was asked how they verify the successive enrichment of> ordinary to heavy water, he answered that up to the moment no determination of> the enrichment has been made, because they do not have a mass spectrometer,> and they have not made determinations by spectrographic methods or determined> density variations. Faced with such an absurd claim and the complete lack of any equipment that infact could verify that any heavy water was being manufactured at all, Dr.Balseiro gave his customary, emphatic, assessment, one any logical scientistwould have made:> Under these conditions it cannot be claimed that the setup actually functions> for producing the enrichment of ordinary into heavy water.24Now, in addition to Dr. Richter deliberately drawing attention tomalfunctioning, improperly positioned equipment, we also have his associate, Dr.Ehrenberg, doing exactly the same thing, this time in connection to a purportedheavy water production facility, for it is Ehrenberg himself who points out tothe Argentine Commission that the scientists have no way whatsoever ofdetermining if they are in fact producing heavy water since they lack theequipment to do so. Why would Ehrenberg deliberately draw the attention of theCommission to this fact? Again, the behavior is not that of swindlers trying toevade exposure, for they are exposing themselves. Nor can their behavior berationalized on the basis that they are trying deliberately to embarrass Perón’sregime, for why slap the hand not only of the very government giving them and somany other former Nazis shelter from Allied war crimes tribunals or retribution,but also of the very government giving them so much financial largesse out ofits own treasury?In any case, following this series of disclosures, Dr. Balseiro then mentions,immediately after the heavy water facility is exposed, that Dr. Richter hasother theoretical models in mind for explaining whatever phenomena he hadobserved:> Dr. Richter maintains that the thermonuclear reactor is a very powerful source> of ultrasound. This is the reason he gave as an explanation for the 60cm> thickness of the walls of the projected great reactor, whose construction has> been interrupted due to water leaks. Asked about what measurements have been> made of the intensity and frequency spread of the ultrasonic flow when the> reactor was working, he replied that none, because they do not have the> measuring instruments for the task. The reason why he knows of the existence> of this intense ultrasound is no other than the physiological effects of> tiredness and neuralgias produced by it. It is evident that without careful> measurements of the ultrasonic flow, it is impossible to make a project for> the great reactor, since there is a risk that protection from the ultrasound> is ineffectual, or else to incur in a waste of material.25 Once again, having been told about a theoretical possibility of explanation,when queried further about his conceptions, Dr. Richter reveals that his team ofscientists has no way of knowing whether or not the explanations aresustainable, because, like the heavy water facility, they have no measuringequipment to do so! For a scientist heading a project on which General Perón haslavished considerable sums from the Argentine national treasury, this is onceagain very odd behavior, for it draws attention to the fact that the scientistsdid not use those funds to purchase the very equipment necessary for the properperformance and monitoring of their facilties! And they themselves are drawingattention to this fact! While this strange behavior called forth no commentaryor response from Balseiro or his associates, one may be reasonably confidentthat it would not have escaped someone like President Perón. All that Balseirosays of Richter and his behavior is to highlight its extremely anomalous naturein a series of remarks about it near the very end of his report:> It is important to point out as well, that Dr. Richter’s way of handling> matters leaves much to be desired with regard to scientific method. (To say the least!)> In the attached report some examples have been mentioned to justify this> opinion, however, they are not the only ones witnessed.> My experience with people trained in the scientific method and with academic> qualifications suggests to my mind, that the attitudes of Dr. Richter are far> removed from what could be taken as the excentricities (sic) popularly> attributed to men of science. To this I might add that in conversations with> Dr. Richter over different subjects in physics he has shown either a> surprising lack of knowledge for a person engaged in a project of such> importance, or else very personal interpretations about well known and> established physical phenomena.26 But in any case, Balseiro concludes his report on a somewhat ambiguous note:“All the phenomena observed” in Bariloche province “bear no resemblance tonuclear phenomena.”27 In other words, they had observed something; they justcould not rationalize it on known scientific principles of nuclear reactions.And that, indeed, was what Dr. Richter had been saying all along.C. Richters’ Replies and The Commission’s Ripostes As mentioned in the previous quotations, Dr. Balseiro attached another report onthe end of his main report to President Perón. This addendum, entitled “Reporton the Replies of Dr. Richter,” indicates that the Austro-German physicist didnot disappear quietly into the night nor go without a fight, but rather, in yetanother continuation of his anomalous behavior, “tried to save” his project bydrawing ever more attention to its technical – and his own scientific –deficiencies!This attachment begins innocently enough:> Dr. Richter claims that the general report (of this commission) is based on> wrong assumptions when it affirms that the proton-lithium reaction can not be> achieved when collision energies are well below 20 (thousand electron volts). Indeed, we have already seen Dr. Balseiro’s arguments, based on the soundphysics of the day, that such reactions were well below the extremes of energiesand heat needed for thermonuclear reactions based on the standard model.Dr. Balseiro continues:> (But) it is nonsense to pretend to use this possibility, whose yield is> extremely small, as the basis of a physical process that involves a chain> reaction. But even so, let us imagine that the reaction can be produced with> an energy of 1 KeV. In order that 1% of the particles reaches such an energy,> a temperature of two millions degrees is necessary. It can be seen, then, that> even in this hypothetical case, for which no reaction can be expected, such a> large temperature is necessary that its production escapes any technical> possibility of being achieved. Imagine, therefore, what is the possibility of> starting the nuclear reaction relying only on a voltaic arc whose maximum> temperature, in the best conditions, does not reach 4000 degrees!28 Richter, in other words, persisted in his claims that he was achievingcontrolled fusion reactions, and by doing so, was only highlighting the factthat such claims could not be sustained on the basis of standard science.This, in fact, is what Dr. Balseiro concludes at the end of this section of hisreport to Perón:> The commission, when considering in detail the new declarations of Dr.> Richter, and based in them, after analyzing the conclusions arrived at in the> previous reports, has to point out that it cannot in any way modify the> opinion reached in the general report, which reads:> “The theoretical concepts provided by Dr. Richter lack the necessary support> to allow any hope of a successful realization of his purpose of maintaining> and controlling a thermonuclear reaction. And furthermore,> “From the experiments carried out the Technical commission has not obtained> any evidence that can justify in any way claims of such a magnitude as those> formulated by Dr. Richter, such as having achieved thermonuclear reactions,> and of being able to maintain them and control them.”29In other words, Richter’s behavior remained curiously anomalous, since hepersisted in his claims and theoretical explanations in spite of theoverwhelming scientific case against them. Once again, Richter was acting almostas if he were deliberately trying to draw attention to those claims, and to thefraudulency of his project.Curious behavior indeed for a scientist wanting to ensure a continued source offunding from Perón’s government!image [images/00037.jpg] Some of Richter’s Equipment at Bariloche; Photo Courtesy of Igor Witkowski30 There are two general ways of rationalizing Richter’s curious behavior: 1) hisproject was indeed fraudulent, and his behavior was that of an imposter playingout the charade to the very end, which is the standard view; or 2) that hisproject was really about something else, something indicated, perhaps, byRichter’s own theoretical explanations of what he was doing. In this case, it ispossible that Richter was following instructions from “elsewhere” to shut theproject down by any means possible. If indeed Richter was involved in somethingentirely different, something extremely sensitive, then Perón’s announcement tothe Argentine Press could only have drawn attention to something that others didnot wish known, and the only way to deflect that attention would be to have thewhole thing declared a fraud. This latter possibility does indeed rationalizeRichter’s and his associates’ behavior much better.The only question that remains, then, is what exactly was Richter’s team doing?image [images/00038.jpg] Huemul Island 1 “Report on the replies of Dr. Richter,”www.ib.edu.ar/informes-huemul/reports-huemul-principal.html, p. 9.2 No author stated. “Perón’s Atom, Time Magazine, Monday April 2, 1951.www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,814503,00.html?promoid=googlep3 No author stated. “Perón’s Atom, Time Magazine, Monday April 2, 1951.www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,814503,00.html?promoid=googlep4 Igor Witkowski, Czwarta Rzesza: Poszukiwania Fortuny Nazistów ( Warsaw, 2005),p. 101.5 No author, “Peron is Irked By Atom ‘Find’ Disbelievers: Scientist says He KnowH-Bomb Secret, Told Not To Make It,” The Washington Post, March 26, 1951.Clipping found in Richter’s file at the U.S. National Archives and RecordsAdministration.6 No author, “Tried to Get Richter Into U.S., Engineer Says,” The WashingtonPost, March 28, 1951, emphasis added.

Perón Gets Help from a Bilderberger One incident seldom mentioned in standard histories of Dr. Ronald Richter’sBariloche Huemul fusion project casts a rather ominous shadow over the wholeaffair, and clearly calls into question the convenient explanations of standardscience. This was the visit, to Argentina, of the Dutch scientist ProfessorCornelius Jan Bakker. Even more curiously, the incident was not revealed until ashort article appeared in a Time magazine article after President Perón’sinvestigative commission delivered the report that spelled the death knell forthe project:> The Argentine government made a cagily indirect answer last week to reports> that Juan Perón had arrested Ronald Richter, his “atomic scientist” (Time, May> 28). Newspapers announced that Professor Richter and his laboratory associates> would observe a national holiday by working 24 hours straight.> But Richter made no public appearance. Instead, Juan Perón issued a decree> placing the entire Heumul Island atomic energy program under his own> direction. On top of that, Professor Cornelius Jan Bakker, a leading Dutch> nuclear physicist, arrived at Huemul Island under a dense cloak of secrecy. He> was apparently brought in as a result of recent talks between Perón and The> Netherlands’ good-will ambassador, Prince Bernhard.> Was Bakker in Argentina to run a check on Dr. Richter? That was what> Netherlanders surmised. Their theory: suspicious of Richter, but leary of> getting involved with atomic experts from the U.S., Britain or Canada, Perón> asked Prince Bernhard for a qualified Dutch scientist to audit Richter’s> books.2 Beyond this, the Time magazine article does not go.But it does raise ominous questions.Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands is perhaps best known for his role in thefounding of the so-called Bilderberger Group. But there is a sinister side toPrince Bernhard:> Prince Bernhard originated meetings of the Bilderberg Group, a collection of> world movers and shakers so secretive they have no proper name. Bernhard was a> former member of the Nazi SS and an employee of Germany’s I.G. Farben in> Paris. In 1937, he married Princess Juliana of the Netherlands and became a> major shareholder and officer in Dutch Shell Oil, along with Britain’s Lord> Victor Rothschild.3 Many have written about the conspiratorial aspects of the shadowy BilderbergGroup, but few have noticed the ominous implications of its premier founder,Prince Bernhard, himself. As a native of Germany, and a member of the SS andemployee of the notoriously powerful German chemical cartel, I.G. Farben, it ispossible that the post-war founding of the Bilderberg Group is but another pieceof the puzzle of post-war Nazi survival and the plans of the Nazi International.Succinctly, it is possible that the Bilderberg Group was created, in part, inorder for the post-war Nazi International to monitor, penetrate, and influencethe plans and machinations of one of their chief rivals for power: internationalcorporatists and globalists. After all, the founder of the Group was himself aNazi, an employee of I.G. Farben, and a member of the SS and therefore anadherent to its credo of loyalty and duty to the Party.But whether or not that speculation be true, there is yet another ominousconnection that Prince Bernhard’s involvement may signify, and that is hisconnection to I.G. Farben, for it was Farben that built the notorious “Buna”synthetic rubber plant at Auschwitz, a plant that Carter Hydrick has cogentlyargued was in all likelihood a massive uranium enrichment facility, and thatRichard C. Hoagland and I have argued may have even employed the exotictechnology of laser isotope enrichment.4 In other words, with Prince Bernhard’sI.G. Farben connection, we have a tenuous connection between Richter’s Barilochefusion project and the wartime atomic research of Nazi Germany.With these revelations, Perón’s consultation of a Dutch nuclear physicistassumes its ominous aspect, for having received a blunt denial of Richter’sclaims from his own scientists, Perón is appealing to a “former” Nazi, PrinceBernhard, for an audit of Richter’s notebooks and claims. It is perhaps quitesignificant that it is after this audit that the project is supposedly shutdown, for nothing appears to be forthcoming in the record about what ProfessorBakker found, nor what he reported to Perón or Prince Bernhard. And givenBernhard’s SS background, we are permitted to assume that whatever he knew, theleaders of the Nazi International also knew. This fact now assumes greatimportance, as we discover the presence in Bariloche province of the most highranking postwar Nazi of them all.1. And America’s Little-Known Ambiguity toward Dr. Richter One author who has also noticed the strangely anomalous features of Dr.Richter’s Bariloche project is long-time Nazi secret weapons researcher HenryStevens. In his recent book Hitler’s Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons,Science, and Technology, Steven’s notes that yet another researcher, thedistinguished and late scientist Dr. Eugene Mallove – best known for hisexposure of the shenanigans of “standard science” in dealing with the coldfusion controversy of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and founder of themagazine Infinite Energy – also noticed the oddities of the Richter affair:> Magnetic confinement fusion had a very strange beginning. Argentine dictator> Juan Peron (sic, et passim) announced on March 24, 1951, that his country had> mastered controlled fusion, bypassing completely the development of fission> power that was then in vogue in various nations. Peron, a Germanophile, had> set up an island laboratory for a certain obscure German scientist, Ronald> Richter, who supposedly had brought the secret fusion work to fruition, or so> headlines in the United States had allowed. The press was much less> circumspect in those days about amazing scientific claims.5 As Stevens quips about the affair,> If we remember Dr. Richter today at all, it is not for his stunning> achievements in physics, but for a press fiasco involving the Argentine leader> Juan Peron in the 1950s. At this time, Richter was employed by Peron to do> nuclear research and evidently had some promising results. Peron jumped ahead> of the research and pre-maturely announced that Argentina had bypassed fission> power and had succeeded in producing fusion power.6 Sensing something extremely unusual about the whole affair, Stevens naturallydecided to investigate with his customary diligence, and procured Richter’sPaperclip file in a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) request from the U.S.government, even though Richter never came to the U.S.A. as a part of theoperation that brought “former” Nazi scientists into the country.The files, according to Stevens, were nothing less than stunning:> Normally, a Paperclip file contains biographical and educational information> about the particular scientist. It usually contains a description of his> specialty as well as where he worked and who he worked for in Germany. There> is a discussion of his alleged political leanings, which are always considered> satisfactory. Then there is a background check, again politically motivated.> Then, there are immigration details and perhaps which companies or government> agencies which are interested in employing this individual. It is then up to> the researcher to follow up these leads for additional information.> Sometimes, there is a description of actual work in Germany and actual> hardware that was created, but this is rare. Also rare is any discussion about> applications of his specialty in the United States or any proposed future> research in the United States. Dr. Richter’s file is the big exception to all> of this.7 What precisely constituted the exception?Behind the public controversy and standard science analysis of Richter thatoccasioned the controversy generated by Perón’s press conference, the files toldanother story completely; they told of genuine though very hidden disagreementamong the American scientists assessing Richter’s viability as a potentialPaperclip scientist:> From the Paperclip file, it (was) evident that the US government and its> scientists given the job of investigating Dr. Richter were torn between two> opposing poles. There were those who considered Dr. Richter a fraud… …much like the official Argentine investigative committee did, and for obviousreasons of conventional scientific analysis. But, notes Stevens, the file alsocontains other types of evaluations:> There were those who openly admitted that they did not have the expertise to> fully evaluate Dr. Richter and clearly wanted to take themselves out of the> game of doing so. And there were those who recognized, even in 1957, that Dr.> Richter “was working in 1970,” an understatement which can only now be> appreciated.8 While Stevens does not cite many of the memoranda concerning the strangescientist, it would be worth doing so not only to uncover America’s peculiarinability to assess his value to its own black projects, but also to see how,long after official disinterest in his ideas was explicitly expressed, interestnonetheless continued. We shall refer to documents Stevens does not cite, forthey are quite revealing.The following document is typical of the ambiguous response to Richter inofficial U.S. Air Force papers:image [images/00040.jpg] image [images/00041.jpg] image [images/00042.jpg] This letter was no doubt in response to a confidential “Air IntelligenceEvaluation Record” dated May 8, 1956. The cover of this document states:“Directorate of Intelligence has investigated possibility of utilizing servicesof Dr. Richter and can offer no further encouragement.” That rather bluntdismissal would seem to corroborate the claims of fraud and incompetence beingadvanced in the world media a few years earlier. But reading the three shortparagraphs on the inside of the document tell a different, and once again veryconflicted, story:> The program outlined by Dr. Richter is theoretically possible. Practically, it> would involve setting up an experimental program costing money and effort far> in excess of what Dr. Richter indicates in his paper. The questions to be> solved concerning the materials and methods needed to achieve the results> possible by his scheme far exceed the capability of present technical> limitations.> Furthermore, Dr. Richter, although having developed a reputation for being a> competent scientist in Europe, has in the last five years exhibited tall of> the characteristics of a first class mountebank and swindler. Under the Peron> government he headed an atomic energy program which consumed large amounts of> money under a cloud of secrecy. When financial exigencies dispelled the> conspiratorial air around his program, his whole scheme “burst with the force> of an exploding soap bubble,” to quote one report on file at ATIC.9> Consequently, it is not reasonable to place very much reliance upon statements> by Dr. Richter, in spite of the apparent technical soundness of his schemes.> It is requested, however, that all material of this nature available continue> to be collected for evaluation. The document is signed by a lieutenant colonel whose signature is unreadable.image [images/00043.jpg] Cover of Air Intelligence Evaluation Record Indicating the US AirForce is Not Interested in Employing Richter image [images/00044.jpg] May 6, 1956 Air Intelligence Evaluation Record of Richter These three short paragraphs, after a cover indicating that the U.S. Air Force’scomplete disinterest in Richter’s work, manage to do five things all at once:> 1) Acknowledges the theoretical possibility of Richter’s physics principles> while simultaneously denouncing them as being far too expensive to research,> and technically unfeasible given the state of technology in the mid-1950s;> 2) Denounces Richter as a “first class mountebank and swindler,” implying that> those very same principles are fraudulent;> 3) Acknowledges Argentina had invested large amounts of money in an extremely> secret project, implying that there was some legitimacy to his physics> principles;> 4) The project exploded with all the force and farce of an “exploding soap> bubble,” implying the same principles are fraudulent once again;> 5) And, to be on the safe side, the U.S. Air Force would continue to collect> and quietly evaluate as much data on Richter and his work as it could. Then, on the page immediately following these three amazing paragraphs there isthe following cryptic comment: “It was learned that Professor Busemann (also oneof Dr. Richter’s references) is familiar with Dr. Richter’s background andcapabilities. Professor Busemann is now with the NACA.” What one of Dr.Richter’s “references” was doing working for NACA, the pre-cursor to NASA, thefiles never reveal, but immediately following this statement there is ahandwritten comment: “Was he contacted?” One never learns, for the files lackany mention of contact with Dr. Busemann.A little further down the same page, the “non-interested” Air Force gives itsshopping list for what specific things in Dr. Richter’s work it is “notinterested” in:> Specifically, This headquarters desires the following information:> a. Technical data, diagrams, and plans concerning his experiments in Argentina> and in Germany in 1943 (reference IR-76-56) with discussion of his problems> and results.image [images/00045.jpg] Air Intelligence Evaluation Record Indicating Interest in Richter’s1943 Research in Nazi Germany > b. Resume of his research activity, problems and results while at> Berlin-Bukler-Waffen-und-Fahrzeugwerke during 1937/38 (reference IR-76-56).After expressing all this specifically directed “disinterest,” the documentconcludes by stating “Should there be no interest in other government agenciesor private industry for Dr. Richter’s services, this headquarters would attemptto retain Dr. Richter, either in the U.S. if he can be permitted to enter, or inArgentina.”What was it about Richter’s resume that had sparked this intense and specificinterest from an Air Force going out of its way to feign disinterest? A glanceat Richter’s own resume in the National Archives files, prepared at the requestof the Americans is revealing.But one of the secret American evaluations contains some bombshells, literally,and in Richter’s own words! I have organized the resume in table form for easierreading, and reproduce the actual documents following.image [images/00046.jpg] image [images/00047.jpg] image [images/00048.jpg] First Page of Richter’s Resume in the U.S. National Archives image [images/00049.jpg] Second Page of Richter’s Resume in the U.S. National Archives Note that Richter leaves completely blank any summary in his resume of whatspecific research he was doing for the Allgemeine Elektricitäts Gesellschaft orA.E.G. in Berlin. The significance of this omission will be seen toward the endof this chapter, but it is worth mentioning – for those who have not alreadynoticed it – that the A.E.G. was the very firm that, under the direction offuture NASA flight director Dr. Kurt Debus, built the power plant for the Bell.As if that tenuous connection were not enough, Richter also supplied hispotential American employers with a list of references with their own impressivecredentials:> Capt. A. H. Bergeson,> Suite 712 Cafritz Bldg.,> 1625 Eye Street N.W.> Washington, D.C.,> Dr. Gordon Dean,> General Dynamics Corporation,> 445 Park Avenue,> New York 22, N. Y.,> Dr. John A.

It is extremely unlikely that Richter the“mountebank and swindler” was dropping names, for it would have been an easymatter for the F.B.I. or even the Air Force’s own intelligence to contact thesereferences.Further reading of Richter’s file reveals the possible reasons for the AirForce’s “quietly disinterested interest,” for they contain some real bombshells.2. Richter’s Paperclip File Air Intelligence Report Summary of HisWartime Research in Nazi Germany The bombshells are in the Air Intelligence Report on the nature of Richter’swartime research in Nazi Germany:> Research on the activation of catalysts, catalyst-controlled high-pressure> coal hydrogenation and coal-cracking processes, development of an> image-converter-like activity-contract-microscope, based on scanning of> hydrogen or deuterium absorbing border surfaces by protons, deuterons, or> electrons: for the first time, it became possible to see and to photograph> activity contrasts which cannot be made visible by light nor by electron> microscopes. Activation of catalysts take place under continuously> activity-controlled conditions. Research work and design studies on electric> arc furnaces systems, development of new types of arc plasma analyzing> instruments and methods. In 1936, discovery of a plasma shock wave generating> process, conception of a completely new type of industrial arc reactor system,> based rather on plasma shock wave reactivity than on heat transfer.> Development of a basis of operation for testing plasma shock wave conditions> by means of plasma-collision-induced nuclear reactions.10 All that is quite a mouthful, and indicates that Dr. Richter, whatever elsemight be said of him, was so far ahead of the conventional thinking of hisAllied counterparts that it is small wonder many dismissed him and his work as afraud.A careful consideration of this passage will demonstrate why: for Richter, inorder to measure the effects he was attempting to create and manipulate – in1936! – was attempting quite literally to develop a microscope that could seebeyond the limits of the electron microscope down into the very fabric ofsub-atomic particles themselves,11 and, from the assertions of the file summary,was allegedly successful to some extent, though, notes Stevens, at the time hewas conducting this research, “he complains about the lack of measuringequipment that could withstand… high temperature stress.”12 Small wonder thenthat in Argentina similar problems arose, since the Argentines were trying touse standard measuring equipment, and Dr. Richter certainly was not helpingmatters by his extraordinarily strange behavior!But the real bombshells come at the end of the paragraph just cited, forRichter, be it noted, was apparently attempting to induce fusion in a plasma bymeans of electrical stress, and was attempting to develop a reactor for thatpurpose that would rely on shock waves, that is, on internal standinglongitudinal waves, to achieve “plasma collisions,” i.e., fusion. While thedescription of the equipment here is broadly consistent with the descriptions ofthe Argentine investigative commission, what they missed is precisely the veryadvanced notion of plasma shock waves as being crucial to Dr. Richter’sconceptions.Just how advanced were these ideas? As I noted in an article entitled “Does ThisRing the Bell?” on my website,13 a very similar idea is being seriously proposedin the beginning of the 21st century by a corporation called General Fusion:> In an article on their website, General Fusion says it will “build a ~3 meter> diameter spherical tank filled with liquid metal (lead-lithium mixture).” If> this is beginning to sound a bit like the Nazi Bell device, hang on, it gets> better, for this lead-lithium liquid metal mixture will then be “spun to open> up a vertical cylindrical cavity in the center of the sphere (vortex).” At> this point “two spheromaks (magnetized plasma ‘smoke ring’) are injected from> each end of the cavity. They merge in the center to form a single magnetized> plasma target.” Does this ring the bell? > The parallels with the Nazi device are amazing. But then comes the> disappointment. We are informed that this sphere is surrounded by steam driven> metal pistons (no kidding!) which are accelerated to velocities of 50 meters> per second. Impacting the outside of the sphere, they create a spherical shock> wave which then drives through the liquid metal, eventually creating a strong> shock wave as it nears the center and collapses the cavity of plasma. When> this happens, “the conditions for fusion are briefly met” and a small burst of> fast neutrons is created, which are then slowed down by the surrounding liquid> metal which, of course, heats up the metal. “A heat exchanger transfers that> heat to a standard steam cycle turbo-alternator to produce electricity…the> lithium in the liquid metal finally absorbs the neutrons and produces tritium> that is extracted and used as fuel for… subsequent shots.”14 In other words, some seventy years later an American company has hit on more orless the same idea: use of plasma shockwaves to induce controlled fusion. Butnote the crucial difference: in Richter’s version, an electrical arc is theshockwave inducer, in the American version it is steam-driven pistons inducingacoustic shock.It begins to look not as if we are dealing with a fraud, but with a verybrilliant man, decades ahead of his time. (But if so, again the naggingquestion, how does one rationalize his peculiar behavior as described by theArgentine investigative commission?)In any case, Richter’s wartime biography becomes even more significant thefurther one presses into it. Stevens notes that Richter began to work for theresearch staff “of the Junkers Aircraft and Motor Works at Dessau, Germany” in1939, with the outbreak of the war. “The Dessau facility for Junkers,” observesStevens, “could be compared to the Skunk Works for Lockheed. Dessau was thefacility for cutting edge research.”15And just what sort of research was Dr. Richter doing at Dessau at Junkers’“Skunk Works”? He was working “on vibrational problems associated withsupersonic aircraft,”16 that’s what. And the allusion to America’s super-secretSkunk Works and advanced aircraft black projects is more than a littlesuggestive, as we shall see shortly.The reasons for Richter’s involvement in this line of research are clear enough,for “he found that the instruments needed to do this could be used to benefithis shock wave research, which he obviously had not put aside.”17Then in 1942-1943 Richter’s research takes another strange turn, as he “foundhimself at the Berlin-Lichterfelde-Ost facility” of German atom bomb scientistBaron Manfred Von Ardenne!18 Here it is worth citing the passage from Richter’sown file that Stevens does not mention, for Richter’s unusually vague languageis significant for its omissions:> When in Berlin, I contacted Staatsrat Prof. Abraham Esau, then in charge of> the German Nuclear Research Program, asking for a research job in this field.> (I became acquainted with Prof. Esau in 1939, when he was visiting my research> laboratory at the Suhler Waffenwerke. Since I was not much interested in> joining the official uranium project, I at least accepted a contract with the> Laboratorium Baron von Ardenne. Sort of ‘personality clash’ developed with the> baron (he is now in Russia) and when I had to direct experimentation with a> Van de Graff generator under direct order of the Army Ordnance, a few weeks> later I was asked to resign (it was the Gestapo again – and the personality> clash).> Similar events happened when I took over a nuclear research job with the> Forschungsinstitut of the AEG, Berlin. Three months later, I was kindly asked> to resign (intervention of the Gestapo again).19 For readers of my previous book on the subject, Reich of the Black Sun, thatname will be ominously familiar, for it was Von Ardenne who in fact hadperfected a method of using cyclotrons and mass spectrography separation tanksfor the enrichment of uranium, one of the technologies I believe to have beeninvolved in the Auschwitz “Buna” plant, which in turn I believe, followingCarter Hydrick, to have been a massive uranium enrichment facility!20Richter’s presence in Von Ardenne’s wing of the Nazi a-bomb project corroboratessomething else that I observed in that book, namely, that the Nazi atom bomb mayhave been seen by the Germans as but a gate to a much more destructive atomicweapon: the hydrogen bomb, since that bomb works precisely on the principle ofnuclear fusion.However, the significant thing to note is that Richter left Von Ardenne’sloboratory under Gestapo pressure, only to be reengaged in unspecified “nuclear”research for the A.E.G., when, again, he is relieved from that position, againby the Gestapo. The year, 1943, is significant, for that same year, Dr. KurtDebus denounced a fellow Bell project A.E.G. engineer to the Gestapo, indicatingthat Richter may have been connected with the project.21By 1944 and 1945, however, Richter found himself developing “light weight”batteries for the A.E.G. firm in Berlin. Nonetheless, “Richter found time tofurther his own work in arc plasma experiments using the large testinstallations available at the AEG transformer factories atBerlin-Oberschöneweide.”22 Here we encounter yet another indicator that Dr.Richter’s wartime research may have been more “connected” to Nazi Germany’s mostsensitive research project – the Bell - than his apparently haphazard wanderingsthrough various projects and German corporations at first glance suggests, butin order to understand that connection properly, we have to leap forward a bit,and examine the story from yet another point of view.B. A Strange Presence in Bariloche After the Affair1. A Look Around Bariloche A glance around the environs of Bariloche, Argentina will show just how heavythe German influence there was (and is), for the architecture is distinctlyGerman, from the houses to the hotels and bierhausen:image [images/00050.jpg] image [images/00051.jpg] German Style Houses in Bariloche23 image [images/00052.jpg] German Public Architecture in Bariloche:Photo Courtesy of Sharkhunters www.sharkhunters.com There is even, in this remote, rugged, and beautiful place in Argentina, aGerman cultural center!24One of the biggest mysteries in Rio Negro province, however, was a large hotel,discovered by Sharkhunters founder Harry Cooper. Sharkhunters is aninternational group of veterans of the submarine services of World War Two, andin particular is dedicated to detailing the history of the U-Bootwaffe of theGerman Kriegsmarine. While on a visit to the Rio Negro province, Cooper foundthis large hotel, of distinctly German architecture, in a town so small that itsmere presence is enough to raise eyebrows: “Why would anyone build such amagnificent hotel at such a little town so far away from other towns?” Coopermused. Indeed, it was “Far away from anything.”25 Built before and during thewar, Cooper discovered that the hotel was the scene of gatherings of Germanveterans on April 20th every year, Adolf Hitler’s birthday. More importantly,according to people Cooper interviewed, General Eisenhower even visited thehotel sometime during or around 1954!26 But that’s not all, for according to thepeople interviewed by Cooper, the motel was originally built as a large plasticsurgery clinic!27image [images/00053.jpg] The Lobby of the Plastic Surgery Clinic-cum-Hotel in the Area ofBarilochePhoto Courtesy of Harry Cooper and Sharkhunters,www.sharkhunters.com If all this be true, then one is able to conclude that the Bariloche area hadbecome the new “Vatican” for postwar Nazis fleeing Europe, the headquarters oftheir covert projects, from providing new identities and faces to its “clients,”to conducting some very advanced scientific research.There is only one conclusion that one may reach in the face of its architecture,its “guest services,” and the nature of the scientific research the Germans wereconducting there:The Nazi International was not only alive and well, but well-equipped,well-organized, and self-evidently well-funded.2. Bariloche’s Prestigious Visitor-Resident(s) Adding considerable weight to the idea that the environs of Bariloche had becomesomething of a “headquarters” for the postwar Nazi International, and to theidea that Richter’s Huemul fusion project comprised something more than just aneffort to control fusion, and that something else may have been going on inaddition to that – something cleverly suggested and just as cleverly disguisedby Richter’s “theoretical explanations” in terms of the actual physics beinginvestigated is the alleged presence in Bariloche province after the project wasshut down of none other than the Nazi party Reichsleiter and the de facto leaderof the postwar Nazi International, Martin Bormann.Paul Manning, a journalist and long-time associate and friend of the famous CBSnewsman Ed Morrow, mentioned Bormann’s presence in Bariloche province, but didnot connect his appearance with the Richter fusion project. Manning begins bynoting that President Truman himself became involved in the hunt for Bormann in1948, three long years after Bormann supposedly died trying to escape Berlin,according to the “official standard” history:> On June 16, 1948, President Truman became involved in the hunt for Martin> Bormann. Robert H. Jackson, who had once taken a leave from the Supreme Court> to serve as U.S. chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, wrote to the> president that a quiet search should be made by the FBI for Bormann in South> America.> “My suggestion, therefore,” he wrote, “is that the FBI be authorized to pursue> thoroughly discreet inquiries of a preliminary nature in South America… I have> submitted this summary to Mr. Hoover and am authorized to say that it meets> with his approval. You may inform him of your wishes directly or through me,> as you prefer.”28 The choice of the FBI to do the investigation is perhaps significant. UnderAmerican federal law after Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 thatcreated the CIA and NSA, the FBI was restricted to intelligence operations onAmerican soil. All operations on foreign soil fell under the jurisdiction of theCIA. So why would Jackson have urged President Truman to undertake aninvestigation in South America through the FBI? After all, Truman himself signedthe law into existence and knew full well its contents.The answer lies once again in the fact that the CIA, which under Zurich OSSstation chief Allen Dulles during the war, had negotiated a highly secret dealwith the head of German military intelligence on the Eastern Front, GeneralReinhard Gehlen, to turn over – lock, stock, and Nazi – Gehlen’s entire networkto the nominal oversight of the American intelligence community, leaving Gehlenin charge of its actual day to day operations. In other words, before the inkwas even dry on the National Security Act of 1947, the CIA’s “civiliancharacter” had already been compromised in the most egregious way, since itsentire operational desk in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and to a greatextent elsewhere as well, was staffed by a network of Nazis! Needless to say,then, the CIA would not be the best instrumentality to investigate Bormann’spossible presence in Latin America! Jackson’s request also suggests somethingeven darker: that both he and Truman knew of the extent of Nazi penetration ofthe CIA, and therefore of its untrustworthiness as an investigative agency forpostwar Nazi activity.In any case, as Manning observes,> The presidential authorization was given, and John Edgar Hoover assigned the> investigation to his most experienced and skillful agent in South America, who> proved that he was just that by eventually obtaining copies of the Martin> Bormann file that were being held under strict secrecy by Argentina’s Minister> of the Interior in the Central de Intelligencia. When the file (now in my> possession) was received at FBIheadquarters, it revealed that the Reichsleiter> had indeed been tracked for years. One report covered his whereabouts from> 1948 to 1961, in Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil and Chile. The file revealed that> he had been banking under his own name from his office in Germany in Deutsche> Bank of Buenos Aires since 1941; that he held one joint account with the> Argentinian dictator Juan Perón, and on August 4,5, and 14, 1967, had written> checks on demand accounts in First National City Bank (Overseas Division) of> New York, The Chase Manhattan Bank, and Manfucaturers Hanover Trust Co., all> cleared through Deutsche Bank of Buenos Aires.29 Bormann’s wartime contact with Deutsche Bank bigwig Dr. Hermann Abs, and theconnections to the international financial interests of Morgan and Rockefellervia their big New York banks, was paying big dividends, for Bormann quiteapparently did not even have to hide his identity, but could sign and cashchecks under his own name through some of the largest and most well-known banksin America as late as 1967!But this is by no means all that the FBI’s purloined Argentinian intelligencefile contained. I cite the file completely, as contained in Manning’s book, inorder to demonstrate how thorough the Argentine security service’s surveillanceof Bormann was:SPECIAL INFORMATION BULLETINMARTIN BORMANN > German Nazi politician, born in 1900, in Halberstadt, Magdeburg, Germany.> Titular head of the National Socialist Party. The Nuremberg War Crimes> Tribunal sentenced him to death, along with other criminals of the Third> Reich. Came to Argentina in a clandestine manner, disguised as a Jesuit> priest, arriving from Genoa, Italy, with false papers, around 1948. And with that, obviously, one has the Vatican connection to the postwar Naziratlines and escape routes from Europe, for in all likelihood, Bormann wastraveling under a Vatican passport. Continuing with Manning’s citation of thefile:> 1948> Bormann was seen and identified in the federal capital. (Information given by> Doctor Pino Frezza, an Italian doctor who met Bormann on an occasion when> Bormann accompanied the Führer – S.I.R. No. 0318.) Bormann made contact with a> former German army officer at the ABC Brewery, at 500 Lavalle Street, in the> federal capital. (S.I.R. 01319l. Juan Felisiak.)30 Martin Bormann and Adolf Hitler were enjoying a nice outing in sunny BuenosAires in 1948!? And what’s more, not only the Argentines, but J. Edgar Hooverand in all likelihood Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson and President HarryS. Truman knew all about it!This prompts a question: why, if Justice Jackson, President Truman, and Hoover’sFBI knew about Bormann’s presence and movements in Latin America (not to mentionthe presence of Hitler himself!) were no efforts made to apprehend him – not tomention Hitler! - and carry out the sentence of execution handed down by theNuremberg Tribunal? As Manning himself notes, “The CIA could have pulled asidethe gray curtain that obscured Bormann – at any time. But the CIA and Müller’scrack organization of former SS men found it to their mutual advantage tocooperate in many situations.”31 That Bormann was allowed to continue bankingunder his own name with large American banks suggests a degree of high levelprotection and cooperation being extended to, or coerced by, Bormann from majorAmerican corporations.At this juncture, it is worth noting that when Manning’s book appeared, manyreaders questioned its whole basis, since Manning did not provide actualphotocopies of the alleged Argentine documents he was citing. Of course,Ladislad Farago, who did provide pictures of the Argentine documents upon whichhe based his Aftermath: Martin Bormann and the Fourth Reich, received an equallydismissive treatment by American and British “establishment historians,” who nowclaimed the documents were frauds.Unfortunately for those “establishment historians,” however, a recent bookpublished a photocopy of a recently declassified FBI document to then directorJ. Edgar Hoover. Subject? The survival of Martin Bormann in Argentina. It makessome very interesting reading, for here is what it states:image [images/00054.jpg] > Further reference is made to my memorandum of May 14, 1948, discussing the two> intercepts received from Bureau Source Two in March of 1947, indicating that> Martin Bormann is, in fact, still alive.

It> appeared that the British were intercepting and decoding traffic over a> clandestine network, a survivor of the German defeat, with ramifications in> Europe and Germany.

Document to Hoover34 By this juncture, it is known what this clandestine radio network that theBritish were intercepting most likely was: it was Nazi Germany’s extensivenetwork of powerful transmitters scatted throughout Argentina and South America,the very network that Schellenberg turned over to Perón for Argentina’s use!35The same Argentine intelligence file that Manning cites, however, also statesthat Bormann visited Bariloche once in the year 1956.36 A second Argetine file,entitled “Special Information Bulletin Number 3,” similarly documents his escapefrom Genoa, Italy “with forged Vatican documentation.”37 This same report goeson to mention Bormann’s presence in some interesting places in 1954:> At the end of 1954, Martin Bormann was seen in Mina Clavera, Córdoba, in the> company of two men with Spanish surnames. He was calling himself José Pérez.> He arrived at the hotel in Mina Clavero suffering from stomach problems and> requested that the hotel manager bring him medicine for gastritis. One of his> companions, named Jimenez, made a trip to Río Zeballos with the owner of the> hotel. He took certain documents with him, and once there, he received> documents for Martin Bormann-Pérez.> The hotel manager overheard some conversations, in which the names of the> cities of Bariloche (Argentina), Validiva (Chile), and São Paulo (Brazil) were> mentioned.38 A little further on, the same report notes that:> In 1957, he was seen in the city of Bariloche, where again he was developing> and coordinating Nazi activities… From Bariloche, Bormann went to Valdiva,> apparently to acquire a farm or to establish contact with a secret Nazi> organization that operated in the south of Chile.39 But what Nazi activities were left for Bormann himself to coordinate inBariloche, when the only known Nazi activities ever centered there wereprecisely Dr. Richter’s “controlled fusion” project for Perón, and since Perónhad long since ostensibly closed the project down?Bormann did much more, however, than merely visit Bariloche after theHuemul-Richter affair. It was, until Perón’s ouster from power in 1955, hisheadquarters, for as Manning notes, he had moved to a 5,000 acre cattle andsheep ranch “about 60 miles south of San Carlos de Bariloche” where he remaineduntil Perón was overthrown.40Bormann had bunkered down, in other words, very close to the center of anongoing postwar Nazi atomic research project of some unknown nature, and thatfact highlights the possibility that the project was extremely important andsensitive to the postwar Nazi International, and that it required a source andamounts of funding other than Perón which only Bormann could provide.So what do we have?> 1) Bormann’s headquarters in Argentina was a large ranch in the same environs> near Bariloche where Dr. Ronald Richter’s “fusion project” was located;> 2) Bormann’s possible presence near Bariloche throughout the Huemul affair and> the Argentine investigation commission’s visits also provides yet another> rationalization for Dr. Richter’s curious behavior, for it makes that behavior> very likely something contrived and performed under direct orders from Nazi> higher-ups, if not even Bormann himself, not so much to shut the project down,> but to close off Argentine involvement with it, and to cloak its real purpose> by discrediting it in the world’s eyes;> 3) After Perón’s overthrow, Bormann returned to Bariloche to “coordinate Nazi> activities” there, suggesting some sort of project continued there,> independent of the Argentine government. Consequently, the following questions assume great significance: What were DrRichter and the German scientists really doing at Huemul? What obscurescientific principles were they investigating? The clues, once again, areafforded by Dr. Richter himself, and a tapestry of little noticed corporaterelationships, Richter’s Paperclip file, and what is already known about theThird Reich’s most highly classified secret weapons project.C. Dr. Richter’s Theoretical Explanations1. The Origins of the Huemul Project: Gerlach and Diebner So let us return to Dr. Richter’s theoretical explanations, as recounted by theArgentine investigative commission’s reports, and dig deeper, interpreting themalong the lines his behavior itself suggested: that he was being ordered by hisNazi bosses to publicly discredit the project in order to severe it fromArgentine influence, and remove it from public scrutiny. Accordingly, Dr.Richter’s remarks have to be unpacked carefully, for as a result of thisinterpretation, he both simultaneously revealed and concealed, that is, hedeliberately misled Argentine authorities as to the exact nature of his researchand its theoretical foundations, so that it would lead to a dead end onconventional scientific analysis, and he deliberately revealed, in a generalway, the basic ideas he was exploring, knowing full well that they would not beunderstood by conventionally minded scientists.With this in mind it is interesting to note that at least one source thoughtthere was more to Dr. Richter than an incompetent at worst, or con man at best.Citing the recent work of German researcher Professor Rainer Karlsch, thewell-known online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, provides the following highlyilluminating bit of background information concerning Richter’s Huemul project:> During World War II German scientists under Walther Gerlach and Kurt Diebner> carried out experiments to explore the possibility of inducing thermonuclear> reactions in deuterium using high explosive-driven convergent shockwaves,> following Guderley’s famous convergent shockwave solution. In other words, as I have long maintained throughout my Nazi secret weaponsbooks and in numerous interviews, the Nazis were, at the minimum, after a cleanhydrogen bomb, and that implies they were after a very different physics thanhas become the standard “public consumption” physics in the West.41> At the same time Richter proposed in a memorandum to German government> officials the induction of nuclear fusion through shock waves by high-velocity> particles shot in to a highly compressed deuterium plasma contained in an> ordinary uranium vessel. The proposal was not carried through.42 The article goes on to note that Richter’s claim to have achieved controllablefusion was wrong on any conventional scientific analysis, though it also notesthat “it is hard at present to analyze his ideas because he never published themin the peer reviewed literature.”43But the summary of Karlsch’s research is indicator enough of the connection –the real connection, and the real physics Richter may have been involved with -for the mention of Dr. Walther Gerlach, project head of the Nazi Bell, and Dr.Kurt Diebner, is enough to permit speculation, coupled with Richter’s owndouble-edged theoretical clues. As we shall see, this connection reveals aweaponization potential far beyond mere atom bombs, or for that matter, merehydrogen bombs.2. Richter’s Conceptions and American Interesta. His Conceptions as Recorded by the Argentine InvestigativeCommission Let us recall, from the previous chapter, what theoretical basis Dr. Richtermaintained his work was based upon.As Dr. Balseiro noted in his report to President Perón,> Dr. Richter has stated that the control device of the thermonuclear device is> based on the resonance obtained between the Larmor precession frequency –> which originates in the interaction of the magnetic field acting on the> intrinsic magnetic moment of the (lithium-7) atom – and that of the> oscillating magnetic field produced by a radio frequency generator44 Additionally, Balseiro noted that much of the key equipment Dr. Richter used wasnot even functioning during his demonstrations for the Argentine commission:> Apart from the theoretical arguments mentioned, it is necessary to add that> even though a radio-frequency generator exists inside the reaction chamber,> this has never been functional during the experimental demonstration.> Furthermore, apart from the electromagnet generating the constant magnetic> field, there is nowhere near the reaction area any device that could generate> the oscillating magnetic field that might produce a resonance with the Larmor> precession frequency as Dr. Richter proposes.45 So what do we have?Let us look a little closer. According to the Argentine investigativecommission, Richter claimed that the following mechanism might inducecontrollable fusion:> 1) precession within a plasma, that is, the plasma was put into a state of> rotation where a “wobble,” like the precession or “wobble” of the earth around> its axis of rotation, or like a toy gyroscope begins to “wobble” when it slows> down, is occurring. But note also that Dr. Balseiro indicated that Richter had radio frequencygenerators, as well as some unused and unspecified electromagnetic equipmentpresent. This implies that> 2) the radio frequency generator was used to oscillate and rotate the plasma;> and that> 3) magnetic containment and rotation may also have been employed; and that,> 4) the radio frequency generator may have been used to pulse the plasma, to> create standing “shock waves” within it. With these observations, we are now in the presence of a new mystery regardingwhat Dr. Richter was up to, and in order to appreciate that mystery in thefullness of its implications, we have to journey to America.b. Richter’s Paperclip File and American Ambiguity As already mentioned, it was researcher Henry Stevens who once again uncovered averitable goldmine of information concerning Dr. Ronald Richter in the AmericanNational Archives and Records Administration (NARA), information that throws thewhole public story of his Huemul fusion project into a cocked hat, and revealsit to be most likely a carefully scripted effort to debunk his research andremove it from the public scrutiny that Perón’s premature press conference haddrawn to it. Stevens revealed his research and the considerable Americaninterest in Dr. Richter in his latest book, Hitler’s Suppressed and Still-SecretWeapons, Science, and Technology. As already noted, as Stevens summarizedRichter’s Paperclip file, it soon became evident> That the US Government and its scientists given the job of investigating Dr.> Richter were torn between two opposing poles. There were those who considered> Dr. Richter a fraud. There were those who openly admitted that they did not> have the expertise to fully evaluate Dr. Richter and clearly wanted to take> themselves out of the game of doing so. And there were those who recognized,> even in 1957, that Dr. Richter “was working in 1970”, an understatement which> can only now be appreciated.46 Just what did the U.S. government’s files on Dr. Richter have to say that couldhave solicited such a wide range of responses?Once again, a glance at the summary of his research work as given in the AirIntelligence Report of his Paperclip file reveals the vast extent of hisexperimentation, and of his conceptual grasp of what was involved:> Research on the activation of catalysts, catalyst-controlled high-pressure> coal hydrogenation and coal cracking processes, development of an> image-converter-like activity-contract-microscope, based on scanning of> hydrogen or deuterium absorbing border surfaces by protons, deuterons, or> electrons: for the first time it became possible to see and to photograph> activity contrasts which cannot be made visible by light nor by electron> microscopes. Activation of catalysts take place under continuously> activity-controlled conditions. Research work and design studies on electric> arc furnaces systems, development of new types of arc plasma analyzing> instruments and methods. In 1936, discovery of a plasma shock wave generating> process, conception of a completely new type of industrial arc reactor system,> based rather on plasma shock wave reactivity than on heat transfer.> Development of a basis of operation for testing plasma shock wave conditions> by means of plasma-collision-induced nuclear reactions.47 Observe carefully what the Air Intelligence Report summary is actually sayinghere:> 1) Richter had discovered plasma shock waves in 1936, and something in the> discovery convinced him that shock waves might be a way to induce> “plasma-collision-induced nuclear reactions,” which is a convenient euphemism> for “controlled fusion.” If so, then it is easy to see why the Nazi Reich had> such an extreme interest in his work, for if fusion could be induced in a> plasma by means of shock waves and controlled, then it was also conceivable> that an uncontrolled fusion chain reaction could be so induced, and thus one> would have a “clean hydrogen bomb,” a weapon of great destructiveness, without> the need of an atom bomb to set one off. But more significantly, Richter was> up to something else, and apparently quite early on:> 2) The construction of measuring equipment with the ability to measure what he> thought he was seeing, and this required the development of a microscope which> could see beyond the scanning and scale range of the electron microscope,> i.e., a “microscope” able to peer into the scale of sub-atomic reactions> themselves, and thus able to “see” the quantum states of particles. This is breathtaking stuff indeed, and the extraordinary nature of Richter’sresearch, both in terms of the actual experimentation and rationalization he wasdoing, as well as in the construction of wholly new types of measuring equipmenthe was attempting to design, are one reason so many more conventionally-mindedscientists were all-too-willing to write Richter off as a fraud, for he wasliterally decades ahead of them not only in what he was attempting to do, but inhow he was attempting to measure it.By 1948, after the war’s end, Richter had, at the behest of another displacedGerman scientist, aerodynamicist Kurt Tank of the Focke-Wulfe aircraftcompany,48 contacted President Perón and persuaded him of the viability of anArgentine project in fusion. As Argentina had no supply of uranium of its ownfor a fission-based project, Perón was quick to see the importance of the idea,and backed Richter.However, this is where the story takes yet another strange turn, one that, onceagain, gives lie to the public press reports and debunking of Richter thatoccurred in the American press after Perón’s 1951 press conference. As the AirIntelligence Report in his Paperclip file records, Richter himself states:> I was not interested in the development of nuclear fission reactor systems but> anxious to develop a controllable thermonuclear reactor system; there was a> certain probability that the chain-reacting schemes, developed in the fall of> 1942, ignited by a shock-wave-controlled arc plasma might turn out to become a> controllable reactor system.49 This is truly astounding information, for if true, then it means that Dr.Richter had succeeded in producing a sustained or almost sustained fusionreaction in a plasma, by means of shock waves, in 1942, without the need formulti-billion dollar Tokamak magnetic containment, high temperatures, or“gigantism” that forms so much of the cult and ritual of modern “publicconsumption” science! This is a step away from a “clean hydrogen bomb.” AsStevens observes, “What he needed to do was fine-tune the procedure to achievebetter control of it.”50Richter and Perón signed a five year contract in October of 1948.51 Thishighlights yet another mystery, for is it likely that Perón would have signed acontract which obligated him to invest tens of millions of dollars on the wordof an obscure German scientist, without consulting his own scientists first?”Germanophile though Perón was, he was hardly foolhardy, and in my opinion, hewould most likely have consulted someone about the viability of the projectbefore investing so heavily in it, to the extent of buying equipment andconstructing Richter’s facilities in remote Bariloche! This fact makes thesubsequent behavior of Argentina’s scientists even more puzzling, if indeed theywere the ones consulted! What had changed in the few short years to sour Perón?The answer has already been suggested in the previous chapter, namely, Richterwas under orders from somewhere else to shut the project down, and was followinga carefully orchestrated script designed to make him and his project lookfraudulent. As we proceed to examine Stevens’ incredible evidence, thispossibility looms ever larger.Indeed, as Stevens notes, the headquarters of Richter’s project was, once again,Huemul Island, which was “within an area habituated or perhaps even controlledby Germans of the Nazi era.”52 That’s putting it rather mildly, for as hasalready been seen, it was an area Bormann thought safe enough to reside in untilPerón’s overthrow in 1955! Bear that date in mind, for it will become importantin a moment.For the moment, however, it is important to note that Richter claimed successfor his 1951 experiments in Argentina, and the Air Intelligence Report of hisPaperclip transcript reinforces this point:> On 16 February 1951 an exponential reactor system was ready for test. In the> first test, the injection of lithium-6 enriched lithium into a> shock-wave-controlled proton hydrogen plasma, for a short interval, produced a> series of primary and secondary reactions, the helium-3 helium-3 reaction> giving proof for the existence of self-reproducing reaction chains. In a> second test, by jetting lithium-6-enriched lithium into avalanche (sic) of> neutron-reproducing reaction chains were monitored. In both tests, the> self-reproducing-reaction chains were analyzed by means of excitation-energy> discriminating ultra-violet sensitive proportional counter tubes. At that> time, a large-scale reactor system was under construction in which a> self-sustaining chain reaction should have been realized; however, this> reactor system has never been completed, probably for reasons of sabotage.53 Note the discrepancy between the Air Intelligence Report’s indication thatlithium-6 was used, and the Argentine investigation commission’s statements thatit was lithium-7.While this may be a minor oversight, it is nevertheless significant that the AirIntelligence Report has Richter describing measuring equipment somewhatdifferent, and perhaps more sophisticated than that described by the Argentinecommission, was in use by Dr. Richter at Huemul. Was this the equipment that Dr.Richter apparently forgot to turn on, thus dooming his experiment to failure inthe Argentines’ eyes? Or, as is more likely, was it equipment that he altogetherhid from the Argentine commission? Perhaps, perhaps not, but in any case it issignificant that the equipment Richter describes for the Americans is somewhatdifferent than that observed by the Argentines.The Air Intelligence Report continues to describe Richter’s 1951 tests. In athird test performed on October 26, 1951, “Richter injected boron into anavalanche of neutron-reproducing reaction chains, which had resulted from theinjection of lithium into the shock wave, controlled, neutron producingdeuterium plasma. The result was that the boron kept the reaction going.”54 Butaccording to the Air Intelligence Report in the American government’s Paperclipfile, there’s more going on with the behind-the-scenes physics than Richter’sdetractors, who were having a field day with him in 1951, were willing to admit:> Later on, the plasma-collision-induced isomerization of indium-and rhodium> nuclei has been proven by monitoring the radioactive emission of gamma> quantums (sic); signal discrimination had to be provided against the> shock-wave-induced brehmstrahlung background.55 For those who’ve been following my analysis of the Bell and its mysterious“fuel,” the so-called “IRR Xerum 525,” through my previous books, The SSBrotherhood of the Bell, Secrets of the Unified Field, and The Philosophers’Stone, this will sound very familiar, for it was indeed metals in the platinummetals group, such as rhodium, that sparked American David Hudson’sinvestigations of high spin state atomic nuclei.56In all of those books, I advanced the idea that the key to the physics of theBell was rotation and torsion shear – an effect similar to Richter’s plasmashock waves – were the key to its field effects, including reports of itslevitation. Additionally, I speculated on the basis of the known data concerningits fuel, “IRR Xerum 525,” that its probable recipe was an isotope of mercury –ideal in its own right for plasma experimentation – and some sort of isomer,such as thorium 229. 57, 58 Isomers are high spin state nuclear materials thatrelease their energy in the form of bursts of gamma rays when they de-excite or“slow down” from that state.59And there is one final connection to the Bell. As I have rationalized thedevice, I believe two types of electrical potential were involved, both highvoltage AC and DC current, much like the references to Dr. Richter’s plasmaelectrical arcs in the Air Intelligence Reports from his paperclip file.60The conclusion is unavoidable because the physics conceptions are all identical:Dr Richter’s Huemul “fusion” project was an extension and continuation of someaspects of the Bell project, Nazi Germany’s most highly classified secretresearch project. This conclusion will become more and more unavoidable as weproceed with our analysis. But in any case, it is now evident why Dr. Richterdeliberately dissembled and created such strange behavior that the Argentinesshut the project down, for its real masters could hardly have desired that anyattention be drawn to it. After all, as the Time magazine and Washington Postarticles cited in the previous chapter attest, America was watching.Indeed, certain comments in Richter’s National Archives file indicates that hewas operating under pressure, not from Perón, but somewhere else, and it isworth considering these statements and their implications quite carefully, forthey point, once again, to the continued existence of the Nazi International,and, moreover, to its probable control over Richter’s project and its real,though highly secret, purpose. Richter’s lengthy typewritten statements are madein response to various questions on the official form he was provided byAmerican authorities. The question that interests us is this:> c. Have you ever been arrested, sentenced, imprisoned, or court-martialed for> any violation of law except for minor traffic violation? Richter’s response tells, briefly, his side of the whole “press conference”affair that blew the lid off of his project’s secrecy:> It is true that I have accomplished series (sic) of exponential fusion> experiments in 1951, but against my strict advise (sic), Peron was announcing> these results with a considerable display of exaggeration and propaganda.> To protect U.S. secrecy in hydrogen bomb development in 1951, I refused to> publish data (and to protect my scientific reputation) when the project was> attacked by the press.> When Peron offered me the position of a National Director of Atomic Energy in> 1951, I refused to accept this position to escape political interference with> my work.> When Peron offered me a professorship at the Cuyo University of Mendoza, I was> ignoring this offer not to become a ‘political professor.’61 As indicated by Richter himself, he had attempted to dissuade President Perónfrom making any announcement about the results of the Huemul experiments. Andhis behavior in subsequently turning down Perón’s blandishments is explicable inonly two ways: the swindler was trying to avoid the exposure that such postswould inevitably bring, or Richter was trying to maintain the politicalindependence of the project by not becoming more involved with Perón’sgovernment, perhaps under pressure from his hidden Nazi masters.In support of the latter view, Richter elaborates further on his owninterpretation of the Argentine commission, and then reveals a curious, and verysignificant, detail:> In July, 1951, I published an article in the United Nations World Magazine,> New York, (‘Argentina has no Atom Bomb’), mentioning for the first time the> underlaying (sic) chain-reacting schemes of the exponential fusion> experiments. > In the fall of 1951, the analysis of the exponential experiments revealed the> existence of field-interaction-induced particle acceleration which led to a> completely new concept of fusion reactor systems: a relatively large research> program was set up to obtain more data.> (When Project Huemul was born in 1949, Peron demanded firmly in the presence> of his ministers that I should not work out secret reports but keep all the> data under strict secrecy; after having arrived at the new concept for fusion> reactor systems, I was trying to improve secrecy.> When I was expelled from the reactor project in November, 1952, the> authorities seized Huemul Island, got all the installations but not the vital> analyzers – and no data).> A large-scale reactor system was under construction but has never been> completed; sabotage was increasing at Huemul Island.> ….> On September 2, 1952, a commission of deputies and a group of Argentine> nuclear experts (?) arrived at Huemul Island; the only purpose of this> commission (headed by the Minister for Technical Affairs, Dr. Raoul Mendé),> was to paralyze the reactor project; facts did not matter at all and were> mostly misunderstood; the ‘findings’ of this commission were pre-set in Buenos> Aires, weeks before arrival at Huemul Island.62 image [images/00056.jpg] Richter’s Version of the 1951 Perón Press Conference image [images/00057.jpg] Richter’s Statement that Argentina Recovered No Data orAnalyzers Richter’s opinion of the Argentine commission is clear enough. However, note thecuriously significant statement that Argentina recovered absolutely no data oranalysis equipment whatsoever from the Huemul project.Recall that Dr. Balseiro in the previous chapter also encountered similardifficulties from Richter. One may discount the possibility that Richterretained his own copies in his own possession, for when he was forced to move toBuenos Aires and live under virtual house arrest, it would have been a simplematter for the Argentine authorities to remove these copies, or – Argentinabeing Argentina – threaten him or his family if the data and analyzers were notturned over. Recall also that his potential American employers also asked fordiagrams of equipment and summaries of recollected data from his Argentine andNazi research projects, indicating that – at some level at least – the Americansdid not have them either. There is only one other possible presence that couldexert such pressure on Richter:Argentina’s Nazis.Nor should the significance of Richter’s persistent Gestapo problems escape ourattention, for it will be recalled that Richter’s first encounter with theGestapo was when working on the atom bomb project with Baron Manfred Von Ardennewhere, after being relieved of that position, he made his way to the A.E.G. andmost probably in some connection to Nazi Germany’s most classified researchproject, the Bell. Here he is again relieved of his post by the Gestapo in thesame year – 1943 - as another Bell project engineer was relieved by the Gestapoafter being denounced by future NASA flight director and Bell power plantdesigner, Dr. Kurt Debus! Even after this, Richter somehow manages to remain atA.E.G. to continue research.If anything emerges from this it is that Richter would have been well-known toGestapo chief Heinrich Müller, who was, after all, responsible for the securityfor SS Obergruppenführer Hans Kammler’s secret weapons think tank. And if he waswell-known to Müller, he was well-known to Bormann. Bormann’s presence in theBariloche area at the same time as Richter’s can therefore hardly becoincidental.3. Another Strange Parallel, Dr. Philo Farnsworth’s Plasmator,and Another Strange Nazi Connection: IT&T But attention certainly was drawn to it, at least in America, which, as we haveseen, quietly and covertly was investigating and even interviewing Dr. Richterwhile its scientists and media were busily denouncing him publicly. Toappreciate the significance of this covert American interest in Dr. Richter andhis claims, it is worth recalling briefly yet another scientist – this time anAmerican one – who made similar claims about his ability to control fusion, andwho made them, more over, in the early 1960s.The scientist’s name was Dr. Philo Farnsworth, and he was, by anyone’sreckoning, a brilliant electrical engineer and scientist. It was Farnsworth whowas the de facto inventor of commercially viable television in America, for hepioneered the development and personally patented much of the technologyemployed.63 Farnsworth even appeared in the early CBS game show What’s My Linein his capacity as “the inventor of television.” If something could be done, orconceived of being done, with vacuum tubes, Farnsworth was the one who couldpull it off.Indeed, Farnsworth first conceived of the idea of using conventional andstandard technology, employing modified vacuum tubes, for the process ofcontrolling fusion while he was perfecting his television inventions. In thisregard, two of his patents are vitally important, one concerns his so-called“Fusor” device and another his “Plasmator” device, both of which were no largerthan a softball! Farnsworth’s last technical patent, U.S. Patent number3,386,883, “Method and Apparatus for Producing Nuclear-Fusion Reactions” wasfiled on May 13, 1966, and the patent was granted on June 4, 1968. First, it isworth a glance at a few of its technical illustrations. In doing so, the readeris reminded that the schematics describe a device no larger than a softball,into which a gas is injected. Surrounding the spherical device, small ionaccelerators are placed which bombard the center of the gas, creating a plasma,which induces fusion by some novel means which will be explored in a moment. Butfirst, a few of the schematics themselves:image [images/00058.jpg] Farnsworth Schematic One, Figure 9, from U.S. Patent 3,386,883 One can see from this the ion guns surrounding the device.image [images/00059.jpg] Farnsworth Schematic Two, Figure 11, from U.S. Patent 3,386,883Showing the Actual Appearance of the Device image [images/00060.jpg] Farnsworth Schematic Three, Figure 21, U.S. Patent 3,386,883 With these pictures in mind, let us now cite the abstract of the patent itself,to discover what Farnsworth’s rationalization for this device actually was:> A method and apparatus for producing controlled nuclear-fusion reaction by use> of self-generated electric fields and inertial ionized-gas containment. The> apparatus comprises a spherical anode which concentrically surrounds a> cathode. A plurality of ion guns are mounted on the exterior of the anode in> spherically spaced and diametrically aligned relationship such that the beam> axes intersect at the center of the cathode. Appropriate apertures permit> passage of positively charged particles outwardly from the cathode interior,> but are biased negatively to prevent the flow of electrons into the> interelectrode space.> A voltage is applied between the anode and cathode. Ions from the guns are> propelled and focused into the center of the cathode establishing in the> cathode interior a series of concentric spherical sheaths of alternating> maxima and minima potentials called “virtual electrodes.” The ions in the> innermost “virtual electrode” have fusion energies, and are contained at a> density sufficient to produce a self-sustained fusion reaction.64 This is breathtaking, for in some respects it parallels the conceptual thinkingof Dr. Ronald Richter, though there is an added subtlety and nuance, and that isFarnsworth’s brilliant idea of containment of a plasma by means of virtualelectrodes, i.e., by means of a field set up in and by the plasma itself.Notably, Farnsworth was also thinking in terms of the same reactions as was Dr.Richter before him, most notably deuterium and helium-3.65With such a device Farnsworth actually claimed to have sustained a reaction forabout half a minute ca. 1965. Following the usual media hoopla, however,Farnsworth’s breakthrough – which again was accomplished without billions ofdollars, gigantic Tokamak magnets, and the customary rituals and bows toconventional science – disappeared after that. What happened?The clue is afforded by what Farnsworth’s patent states at the very beginning ofthe document, which states that he is “assignor to International Telephone andTelegraph Corporation, a corporation of Delaware.”66While Farnsworth’s inertial confinement by dint of “virtual cathodes and anodes”within his Plasmator and Fusor devices are based on slightly differentconceptions than Richter’s rotation-and-shock wave approach, it is likely thatthe geometries generated within the plasmas by Farnsworth’s device were similarif not identical, for ion bombardment of a plasma gas so confined would indeedgenerate shockwaves within the plasma which in turn would compress the gas to“fusion energies and densities” as the patent itself claimed. Small wonder,then, that I.T.&T. basically confiscated Farnsworth’s device, for as is nowknown, the connection between I.T.&.T. and the Nazis – even to the extent of itsinvolvement with the overthrow of Marxist Chilean President Salvadore Allende inconjunction with the Nazi colony at Cologna Dignidad and the American CIA – arewell known, as was seen in part one of this book! Someone, somewhere, was tryingto ensure that any public knowledge or scrutiny of the science involved in Dr.Richter’s or Dr. Farnsworth’s fusion devices never occurred, for they led to adeeper and far more powerful physics than mere fusion. While Farnsworth’sdevice, with its virtual cathodes and anodes, represents in some respects anadvance on the thinking of Richter, Richter in some respects also has perceivedwhat Farnsworth did not explicitly state: the need for rotation and shockwaves.4. Fusion, Torsion, and Stars: The Work of Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev The relationship of a rotating plasma to the control of fusion may seem obscure,unless one recalls the fact that a little known Russian physics genius by thename of Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev also discovered the same thing, a fact that made hisresearch one of the most closely held secrets of the former Soviet Union. Andlike Richter, Dr. Kozyrev soon found his work publicly denounced byconventionally minded scientists in the state-sponsored newspaper Pravda.Kozyrev began his work, as I noted in my book The Philosophers’ Stone: TheAmerican “Gold,” The Soviet “Mercury,” and the Nazi “Serum”, by observing thatthe conventional view of nuclear fusion in stars simply could not account forall the energy they were producing:> The whole principal motivation, by his own reckoning, for his decades’ long> investigation of torsion, and of the torsion amplifying and shielding> properties of various elements and compounds, was precisely the fact that> there simply not enough neutrinos being emitted by stars for the standard> model of stars as gigantic perpetual fusion reactors – essentially perpetual> hydrogen bombs – to be true.67 As I observed a little further on,> The more than coincidental attack on Kozyrev in Pravda in 1959 effectively> (prevented) him from open publication of his experimental results and> theoretical conceptualizations, and the similarly-timed disappearance of> discussion of clean fusion bombs in the open Soviet literature (is likewise> suspicious). Let us speculate a bit.> We have already encountered the fact that the earliest atmospheric hydrogen> bomb tests far exceeded their pre-test calculated yields. In other words, just> as (Kozyrev maintained was happening) in stars, some other energy source was> being tapped into, and transduced by, the thermonuclear detonation itself. And> if we extend this line of speculation, the Russians most likely encountered> the same phenomenon in their hydrogen bomb testing. Moreover, in Kozyrev, they> had an astrophysicist who thought he knew why stars, also implicating> thermonuclear processes, appeared not to be radiating enough neutrinos energy> for the thermonuclear model to be true.> One may reasonably and logically conclude, therefore, that the 1959 Pravda> attack on Kozyrev was really a cover story to denounce his work, to> de-legitimize it to anyone in the West who may have been paying attention to> it, while Kozyrev, and his work, disappeared – as they did – into the highest> reaches of classification within the Soviet Union, for his work provided the> necessary key to understand why H-bombs were returning such anomalous yields,> yields that, moreover, most likely varied with the time of their detonation.> Kozyrev knew why: it was because the bomb itself became, for that brief> brilliant nano-second of the initial explosion, a dimensional gateway, a> sluice-gate, opening the spillway to a hyper-dimensional cascade of torsion> into the reaction itself.68 And of course, when one says torsion, one is saying rotation; that is, therotation of the plasma itself was the gateway transducing energy from “somewhereelse” into the reaction.Thus a logical question occurs. If a rotating shockwave in an electricallypulsed rotating plasma transduces this “extra energy from somewhere,” then didDr. Richter notice a similar thing, long before Kozyrev and the Russians did?Buckle your seatbelts, because this is where the story gets extremelyinteresting!5. Richter, Ram Jets, Shockwaves, and Aurora In one of the Air Intelligence Reports reproduced (in their entirety) byresearcher and author Henry Stevens, Richter expounds at length for hisprospective American employers – in 1956! – on a propulsion system based oncombining “rocket and ramjet operations within the same propulsion system.”69 Heelaborates on this idea a little further into the report:> A rocket is just another branch of jet propulsion and becomes a ram jet system> when the mass (and the oxygen, in case of chemical combustion processes) to be> discharged is taken from the outside atmosphere instead of being stored in the> aircraft fuselage itself.> A jet propulsion system has to be developed which is operating as a rocket> system at take-off and becomes self-operative as an intermittent and steady> flow ram jet system gradually with increasing speed of flight. The> continuously controlled conversion of one propulsion phase into the other can> be achieved by the control of the combustion process itself.70 So far, so good. But what has this to do with his fusion-plasma shockwaveresearch? Everything, for a little further on in the same report, he makes clearthat he is thinking in terms of a wholly new type of ramjet:> In the first line, the advantages of a shock-wave-controlled ram jet system> lies in the fact that all the different systems of propulsion are combined in> one, making also possible the continuously controlled conversion of one> propulsion system into the other, in flight.71 In other words, Richter was proposing an aircraft that would use rockets fortake-off and to attain the necessary velocity for the ramjet phase to becomeoperable, since ramjets only begin to be able to operate at speeds in excess ofapproximately 200 miles per hour. Once obtaining this speed, the aircraft couldconvert to ramjet operation, and gradually climb to extraordinary altitudes onthe very edge of space, where, again, the rocket phase could take over. Richterwas proposing, in other words, a combination aircraft and spaceship capable ofextraordinary speeds and altitude. If all this is beginning to sounduncomfortably familiar, hang on, there’s more.That Richter was not thinking in terms of an ordinary ramjet is made abundantlyclear by his remarks that occur almost in the exact center of the Report:> For many years, the author was experimenting with a new shock wave generating> process, the shock waves being generated by an electro-magnetically controlled> extremely hot arc plasma zone. By the same process technique, shock waves can> also be generated in combustion chambers and in gaseous zones heated by the> impact of nuclear energy.> The analysis of the injection of gaseous jets into a superposition of powerful> shock waves revealed interesting data in regard to the penetrability of> shock-wave-controlled zones. In the course of these investigations, it became> obvious, for instance, that the valves of an intermittent ram jet system can> be substituted by shock waves, thus providing for the continuously controlled> conversion of an intermittent into a steady flow ram jet system… On that> basis, it should become possible to start an intermittent> shock-wave-controlled ram jet system without the help of> acceleration-assisting means by a series of shock-wave-generating> explosions.72 Note that Richter has proposed the following possibilities as implications ofhis plasma shockwave discoveries:> 1) A nuclear-powered ramjet, which would make any aircraft employing the> technology to possess virtually unlimited operational range and duration, a> range and duration presumably only limited by the limitations of any human> crews operating it;> 2) This ramjet system would not be conventional in the sense of employing a> simple valve, such as was the case of the shutter-valve on the German V-1> “buzz bombs”, for example, since the shock waves themselves would constitute> the valves opening and closing the admission of combustible fuel into the> system;> 3) Finally, Richter has made clear that his new type of ramjet would function> as a series of closed, controlled explosions: it would, in short, be a kind of> ramjet pulse engine. In fact, as Richter makes abundantly clear, this type of> engine might not even need the conventional rocket phase in order to “get up> to speed” for the ramjet to operate, but might be able to do it from the> initial takeoff phase of flight. If all this sounds familiar, it ought to, for just such a system – sans thenuclear aspect – is alleged for the super-secret American spy-plane, theso-called Aurora. Indeed, one researcher even captured photographs of a peculiarcontrail, allegedly from the Aurora, in the skies over Texas. The contrail was aconventional contrail in every respect except for the fact that every so often,at regular intervals, there appeared to be a ball or puff of smoke, like beadsspread out on a necklace string, or like doughnuts. But Aurora is late 1980stechnology (if it exists); Richter, however, was proposing the idea in 1956 onthe basis of experiments and discoveries made in Nazi Germany a decade and ahalf earlier than that!The conceptual connections between Richter’s plasma experiments and his ramjetproposals are made clear in the next Air Intelligence Information Report fromhis Paperclip files, IR 80-56, again dated 1956. The Report begins by asignificant disclaimer:> Approving Officer is not technically qualified to comment on the subject> presented. However, Dr. Richter is, in the opinion of qualified German> scientists resident in Argentina(!), a complete fraud who has “parlayed” a> limited scientific background and a glib tongue to obtain much plublicity:> i.e., the explosion of the so-called “Argentine Atomic Bomb” in 1952. In the> opinion of these qualified German scientists, the disgrace and obscurity that> Dr. Richter now enjoys is better than he deserves.73 Note three implications of this disclaimer.First, long after the Argentine press conference and Richter’s denunciation bythe Argentine Investigative Commission as a fraud (and the ensuing mediacampaign that only served to reinforce that view), the clear implication of theAir Intelligence Information Report is that the Americans, for some reason,decided to quietly investigate Dr. Richter anyway, and this can only imply thatthere was some scientific merit to his ideas, notwithstanding the publiccampaign against him.Secondly, note the fact that the American report makes clear that “Germanscientists resident in Argentina” were the ones consulted first, and that theyregarded Richter as a fraud, apparently doing so with some vociferousness, sincethe report maintains that these scientists thought Richter well deserved his newobscurity. In short, the implication is that the “German scientists resident inArgentina” – a polite euphemism for Nazi scientists – were the ultimate originof the press campaign and denunciation of Richter’s project, a view which tendsto support our analysis in the previous chapter that Richter’s strange behaviorbefore the Argentine investigative commission appears to have been deliberatelycontrived precisely in order to de-legitimize both the project and Richter’sscientific rationalizations of it, in much the same fashion as Pravda wouldde-legitimize the work of Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev before it went “deeply black”within the Soviet Union.Finally, note that the Report clearly and unambiguously reaffirms what theoriginal press frenzy and the Argentine commission itself drew attention to,namely, that Richter had set off some sort of explosion on Huemul, whichnevertheless was not heard a mere 6 ½ miles away in the nearby town. In otherwords, the Report reaffirms, in its own roundabout way, that Richter’s work hadweaponization potential.And the date is significant, for this is four to five years after Richter hadbeen almost universally denounced as a fraud, an occurrence brought about, asnoted in the previous chapter, by his strangely anomalous behavior! In brief,someone – namely the “German scientists in residence in Argentina” – had gone toa great deal of trouble to make it appear that Richter and the whole fusionproject at Huemul was completely bogus while they quietly and quickly relocatedthe project with new personnel; and someone – namely the Americans – weren’tbuying that story in 1956!In any case, Richter’s own words in this second Report are worth citing. Hestates that “the operation of a plasma reactor system can be considerablyimproved by jetting a mixture of reactants through the high energetic arc plasmazone at very high velocities.”74 This is the basis of the connection between hisnuclear pulse-ramjet proposals and his plasma research. In the remainder of thereport, Richter goes on to outline his 1936 discoveries that formed the basis ofhis conceptualization and subsequent experiments in Argentina, reinforcing onceagain the fact that in spite of public disgrace, the American military waspaying a great deal of secret attention.But the real bombshell is dropped at the end of Air Intelligence InformationReport IR-145-56, where a very different, and presumably the final, Americanevaluation of the German scientist is given.> The material contained in this report is beyond the technical ability of the> Preparing Officer to evaluate. Conversation with dr. (sic) Cooper and Dr.> Multhopp, scientists of the Glenn L. Martin Company of the United States who> have interviewed Dr. Richter, revealed that there may be something of value in> the work and theory of Dr. Richter. The report was submitted by Vergil Nestor, Lt. Colonel, USAF.A little later on, on July 3, 1956, the same Lt. Col. Nestor submitted twomemoranda to the Headquarters of the United States Air Force to the attention ofthe Air Attache Branch in Washington, D.C. As one memorandum reveals, Americaninterest in Richter was hardly based on their evaluation of him as being afraud:> CONFIDENTIAL> The Foreign Service of the United States of America> Office of the Air Attache> United States Embassy> Buenos Aires, Argentina,> 175-R&D 3 July 1956> (Ucl)> SUBJECT: Dr. Ronald Richter (See IR-76-56, 79-56, 80-56> and 145-56)> TO: The Director of Intelligence> Headquarters, USAF> ATTN: Air Attache Branch> Washington 25, D.C.> 1. A recent visit by a group of U.S. atomic energy scientists to Argentina,> headed by Dr. John Hall, resulted in a conversation among Dr. Richter, Dr.> Hall and two other scientists in the group. The undersigned officer attended a> meeting with Dr. Hall subsequent to this conference and the following items of> interest relative to Dr. Richter are being forwarded for information and> whatever action is required:> a. Dr. Richter is considered by Dr. Hall to be “a mad genius”. Along the same> lines Dr. Hall stated that Dr. Richter is thinking in the year 1970. Dr. Hall> was quite impressed with the knowledge, theories and work of Dr. Richter.75 In other words, the American military, far from considering Dr. Richter a fraud,was slowly waking up to the idea that they were dealing with “a mad genius”thinking decades ahead of the rest of the pack! The memo is signed by Lt. Col.Vergil N. Nestor, USAF, air attaché to the American embassy in Argentina’scapital.But there’s more. A second memorandum of the same date, presumably in reply toLt. Col. Nestor, according to Stevens, “contains a significant paragraph.”> 3. Dr. Richter’s work in Argentina should be reviewed by a competent> specialist. The recommendation of Dr. Hall to interrogate Dr. Richter is> concurred in. Specifically, this headquarters desires the following> information:> a. Technical data, diagrams and plans concerning his experiments in Argentina> and Germany in 1943 (reference IR-76-56) with discussion of his problems and> results.> b. Resume of his research activity, problems and results while at> Berlin-Suhler-Waffen-und-Fahrzeugwerke during 1937/38 (reference IR-76-56).76 In other words, after having interviewed Dr. Richter in 1956 concerning his“fraudulent” work in Argentina, the American military not only considered him “amad genius” who was “thinking in 1970,” but also wanted to know more about workdone during and prior to the war in Nazi Germany!But why pay attention to wartime work done in the Nazi Reich at all?The answer is nothing less than stunning, and horrifying, for “Dr. Richter’smind had already moved beyond the production of a sustained fusion reaction andthe technological implication, thereof.”77 A Stevens notes, “a clue to thisbroader thinking is given in his specialties” as noted in his Paperclip file,for these include the “development and testing of highly-turbulent,magnetic-field-controlled fission and fusion plasma systems. Experimentalapproach to solar flare conditions and to the explosion-tendency of the solarplasma, ultraviolet excess analysis, excitation of space structure bypulsation-controlled plasma implosion, testing the limitations of quantummechanics and quantum dynamics, Experimental approach to the unified fieldtheory and to the velocity of propagation of gravity, a.s.o.”78In other words, Richter had seen something in his plasma experiments in Germanythat led him to a similar conclusion as Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev later observed inRussia: the plasma fusion processes were transducing excess energy from thegeometrical distortions they were introducing in space-time itself. As Stevensquips, “It is clear that Dr. Richter’s method was experimentation, not merelyconducting ‘research’ by scribbling mathematical babble on a chalkboard and theninsisting on a Spinosian set of definitions of exactly what the physicaluniverse actually is.”79As if all this were not enough, Dr. Richter spells it all out very plainly, bystating that his work is really about an “experimental approach to zero pointenergy…deriving from the analysis of exponential fusion experiments in 1951…”80This was made evident to Richter when> Analyzing the induction spectrum of an extremely turbulent> shock-wave-superimposed plasma of ordinary proton hydrogen, a specific class> of signals revealed the existence of sort of ‘decaying structures’, not> resulting from eventual electron capture by protons, forming decaying> neutrons, another class of signals, characterized by extremely large> amplitudes and very small pulse width was even indicating the existence of a> certain exchange mechanism of energy, the source of the energy still being a> mystery… Richter spells it out clearly:> (We) assume, that highly compressed electron gas becomes a detector for energy> exchange with what we call zero point energy, zero point energy derives from> the exclusion principle, the exclusion principle derives from empirical data,> in a shock-wave-superimposed, turbulence-feed-back controlled plasma zone> exists a high probability for cell-like super-pressure conditions, gas> represents an enormously high energy capacity of exchange processes, about> 1010(kilowatt hours) per unit volume, on the basis of exchange coupling, it> seems to be possible to ‘extract’ a compression-proportional amount of> zero-point energy by means of a magnetic-field-controlled exchange fluctuation> between the compressed electron gas and sort of cell structure in space…,> representing what we call zero point energy, it seems even possible that the> large-amplitude fluctuation signals derive from a mechanism of> energy-conversion unknown to us…plasma implosion analysis might turn out to> become an approach to a completely new source of energy.81 This is heady wine indeed, for clearly, Dr. Richter has, on the basis of hisexperiments, projected conceptions that will only occur decades later, namely,the idea that space-time has a lattice-like or cellular structure, which, whendistorted, becomes the source of physical forces, energy, and action, and thatthe means to do this lies through shock waves in a turbulent plasma, i.e., viarotation.In short, at almost every turn, Dr. Richter’s thought, and the Huemul projectitself, evidences itself as a continuation of the Bell Project, up to andincluding the latter’s probable weaponization potential as a kind of “torsionbomb” based on rotating and electrically pulsed plasma and shockwaves.6. Ball Lightning, The A.E.G. and Richter As if all of this were not enough to convince the most hardened scientificskeptic that there was more to Richter’s Huemul project than meets the eye, orthan the public denunciations of his work as fraud would allow, there is even abrief mention of him in a recent scientific paper on ball lightening, analyzingit as a high frequency spherical cavity resonator, and surprisingly, it concernsthe published memories of Richter’s Argentine associate, the scientistEhrenberg, whose similarly anomalous behavior and statements to the Argentineinvestigation commission about the heavy water production facility on Huemulalso contributed to their recommendations to Perón to shut the project down. Thepaper states:> When W. Ehrenberg came back from Argentina to Germany (in the middle of the)> fifties he reported about the first large scale attack on nuclear fusion of> Dr. Ronald Richter on the island of Huemul near St. Carlos de Bariloche/> Argentina. Inside a “pole cross” of his discharge device Richter had produced> high temperature, horrible ‘plasma balls’, he reported. Although Ehrenberg had> essentially misunderstood the concept of the discharge circle not becoming> aware of the high voltages and huge capacitors employed, it is remarkable,> that Richter had spoken to him about values and conditions of resonance –not> going into more details.82 But what is the connection of ball lightning to all this?7. The Bell Flies to Argentina: Brooks, Ball Lightning, A.E.G., andthe Bell As I noted in my previous book on the Bell, The SS Brotherhood of the Bell,British researcher Geoffrey Brooks maintains, on the basis of his Argentinesources – Brooks lives in Buenos Aires – that the Bell and its projectdocumentation flew to Argentina from Norway aboard a Junkers 390.83 Thesignificance of Bormann’s assignation of Luftwaffe Kampfgeschwader 200 to SSGeneral Kammler’s direct control is now evident, for with control of thoselong-range heavy lift aircraft, and with so much documentary and photographicevidence pointing to or corroborating a heavy Nazi presence in Bariloche thatmost likely included Bormann itself, the total context thus also argues quitestrongly that the Bell and Kammler made its way there as well, and thatRichter’s project represented the continuation of some aspects of the Bellproject.While researching and writing this book, Mr. Brooks contacted me, and sharedwith me by email the following information, which, with his gracious permission,has been included here:> Dear Dr. Farrell:> …> During the 1930s, AEG had a laboratory on the roof of the> Charité Hospital in Berlin. Its purpose was to study ball-> lightning, which is of course the basis of the Bell theory.> Best wishes,> Geoffrey Brooks84 The A.E.G. Corporation, or Allgemeine Elektricitäts Gesellschaft, was, ofcourse, the same firm that built the powerplant for the Bell, a powerplant inturn designed by future NASA space flight administrator at the Kennedy SpaceCenter in Cape Canaveral, Florida, Dr. Kurt Debus.85 And one of the earlyproject codenames for the Bell project according to Igor Witkowski was preciselythe Charite-Anlage project, the codename under which Witkowski learned about theBell’s extreme classification at the very pinnacle of the Third Reich’s secretweapons projects.868. A Possible Corporate Connection to Argentina’s HuemulProject: A.E.G., and Back to the Bell Yet another small clue as to the nature of the Huemul project and its possiblerelation to the wartime Bell project is afforded by Paul Manning. As Alliedpressure mounted for Argentina to break relations with the Axis powers and jointhe Allied cause, a former German ambassador to the country began to holdmeetings on his farm in Argentina’s Córdoba province, anticipating an eventualbreak between the two countries. The purpose of the meeting was to form anorganization that could continue to represent German interests, and particularlybusiness interests, after the German, Italian, and Japanese diplomatic corps inthe country were sent home in the eventuality of a break in relations betweenArgentina and the Axis. The group that was formed included both Argentine andGerman corporate and military representatives, and would, of course, be fullyintegrated into Bormann’s postwar organization.Significantly, one of these corporations was the A.E.G.,87 or AllgemeineElektricitäts Gesellschaft. This was the very corporation Dr. Richter wasworking for at the end of the war, according to Stevens.88In other words, we have not only the same physics conceptions involved in theBell Project and Dr. Richter’s Huemul project, and the same personnel somehowinvolved, i.e., Richter himself, but there is an identifiable link to one of theGerman corporations involved: the A.E.G. itself.D. The Conclusions Imply a Possible Scenario All of this permits a speculative scenario to be outlined, given the conclusionthat we have reached that Richter’s Huemul project involved a continuation ofthe Bell project, either in its entirety or in certain particular respects. Thescenario begins with the madcap dash of General Patton’s Third Army in 1945,across southern Germany, into Austria, and, more importantly, into Pilsen,Czechoslovakia, the nerve center and headquarters of SS General Kammler’s secretweapons think tank. As already outlined in this book, this is because Americanintelligence had learned how close the Germans were to marrying their a-bombs toa workable delivery system, or because they possibly knew also of some projectwithin the Kammlerstab involving “doomsday physics” far more fearful in itspotential than mere atom or even hydrogen bombs. There is also the possibilitythat U.S. General Patton’s Third Army was steered there by German psychologicaloperations via the “National Redoubt” myth.As I noted in The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, Polish researcher and author IgorWitkowski maintains that the Americans were trying to reassemble the Bell’sscientific team as best as they could. In this respect, the covert Americaninterest shown in Dr. Richter’s work is possibly further testament to the factthat this interest continued very quietly long after the war. All theseconsiderations imply that the Bell, its project documentation, and GeneralKammler did not make their way to America. It remained in German, that is tosay, Nazi hands after the war, and its science continued to be developed bythem, initially, as has been seen, in Argentina, and after the project was“closed down” by Perón, it most likely was moved elsewhere.89When Richter shared some of his experimental results with dictator Perón,however, the project security was very nearly blown, for Perón’s response – hisinfamous press conference of 1951 – was hardly anticipated by Richter or hishidden Nazi masters, one of whom, as we have averred in this chapter, was mostlikely Martin Bormann himself. With world attention focused on Argentina, on Dr.Richter and on the Huemul project, the decision was taken to discredit Richterand the whole enterprise publicly, and Richter and his team were given theirorders, orders that scripted their carefully anomalous behavior that guaranteedthe project’s demise.Perón, however, was not easily put off the scent, for in addition to assemblinga native Argentine scientific commission, he quietly solicited the help ofBilderberger and former SS officer, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.Bernhard, whose pro-Nazi background, membership, and sympathies were thusevident, himself sent a scientist – Dutch physicist Bakker – who most likelyreinforced the Argentine commission’s findings, and the project was shut down.Bernhard, a major shareholder in Royal Dutch Shell, would thus have had twomotivations operating to keep the project out of the prying public eye: thefirst being because such a technology and its promise for energy would have madepetroleum based energies and economies as obsolete as the dodo bird, and thesecond because, as a former SS officer, he was beholden to the still-extantchain of command that culminated with SS generals Kammler, Müller, and mostimportantly, Bormann himself. They would have wanted the project kept quiet forobviously different reasons.Given the care, however, that the Nazis took to ensure that the original Bellproject did not fall into any Allied hands after the war, one may be reasonablycertain that a similar fate awaited the Huemul extension of that project:Richter, now a public figure, was retired like Gerlach (the Bell project’sactual head in Nazi Germany) before him, as being too high profile. Anotherscientist was likely chosen to head it up, and the project was most likely moved– we know not where – and continued.But was the Huemul project in fact a continuation of the Bell project?There is one final piece of evidence that has not yet been presented. As alreadynoted, Sharkhunters founder Harry Cooper, who contacted this author as this bookwas being written, led an expedition to Rio Negro province of Argentina, andphotographed the many examples of German architecture in the region, not theleast of which was the suspiciously large plastic surgery clinic cum hotel inthe middle of nowhere.But this is not all that Cooper photographed. Knowing of Richter’s Huemulproject, Cooper visited the island home of Richter’s laboratories, andphotographed the numerous ruined bunkers and facilities on the island. Onephotograph in particular literally took my breath away when I saw it.image [images/00061.jpg] Metal Drums, Remains of Richter’s Huemul Fusion Project,Photograph Courtesy of Harry Cooper and Sharkhunters,www.sharkhunters.com As readers of any book dealing with the Bell, whether Igor Witkowski’s TruthAbout the Wunderwaffe, Nick Cook’s Hunt for Zero Point, or my own books SSBrotherhood of the Bell, Secrets of the Unified Field, or The Philosophers’Stone by now knows all too well, the actual Bell device employed, in itsinterior, two counter-rotating metal drums which were used to spin its “fuel,”the IRR Xerum 525. No one knows exactly what these drums that Cooperphotographed were used for, only that they had something to do with Richter’sproject.But we know, or at least, are permitted to speculate on the basis of all thathas been herein presented, that these drums are yet another clue that Dr.Richter and his project were continuing the work begun long before by Professorand Nobel physics laureate Dr. Walther Gerlach, a man whose specialty wasmagnetic spin resonance, and gravity, in a project that merited a classificationhigher than Nazi Germany’s atom bomb itself, a classification ofKriegsendscheidend or “war decisive.”When that original Bell project, along with Richter’s own theoreticalrationalizations, which similarly invoked hyper-dimensional physics, the unifiedfield theory, zero point energy, high-spin high-turbulence plasma shock waves,electrical arc pulsing, and rotating plasma itself are all taken intoconsideration along with Bormann’s suspicious presence in the very same region,and along with Richter’s peculiar behavior to the Argentine investigationcommission, then the conclusion seems all but certain:The postwar Nazi International was continuing the development of the verytechnologies that gave them control of the energies of the very fabric andstructure of space-time itself, energies and technologies that would alter thevery structure of world finance, geopolitics, technologies that held suchhorrendous weaponization potential that it would make an H-bomb look like afirecracker, and they weren’t about to let anyone else have it.If it seems by now that we have strayed far from the science fiction novels ofWilhelm Landig, there is one application of the Bell technology that, as Richteralso implied, involves space itself. To it, and the postwar Nazi determinationto dominate space, we now turn.1 Henry Stevens, Stevens, Hitler’s Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons, Science,and Technology, pp. 290-291.

Von Ardenne’s process was theNazi equivalent to Lawrence’s beta calutrons in the United States, though it wasmore efficient than Lawrence’s. Several of these cyclotrons in use at theAuschwitz plant would certainly account for the facility’s anomalously highelectrical consumption (if it were really a Buna plant its high electricalconsumption makes no sense). But as I also revealed in my most recent book ThePhilosophers’ Stone: The American “Gold,” The Soviet “Mercury,” and the Nazi“Serum” (Feral House, 2009), there are other even more advanced isotopeenrichment technologies that may have been in play at Auschwitz.21 Igor Witkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe (European History Press,2003), pp. 256-259.22 Stevens, Stevens, Hitler’s Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons, Science, andTechnology, p. 262.23 Photo courtesy of Igor Witkowski, Czwrate Rzesza.24 Harry Cooper, “Argentina’s Place in the War,” KTB #209 Sharkhunters: theOfficial Publication of the U-Bootwaffe, p. 10.25 Ibid., p. 11, emphasis in the original.

Was Eisenhower being “vetted”for his suitability as a presidential candidate by this group, in a “BohemianGrove” or Bilderburger Group style meeting? Or was Eisenhower being told “theway things really are”? We will never know, of course, but if the alleged visitbe true, it does put his subsequent and most famous speech, the one given to thecountry when he was leaving office and warning about the dangers of the“military-industrial complex,” into a unique perspective. Indeed, as I averredin my book Reich of the Black Sun, Eisenhower may not have been talking solelyabout the American military-industrial complex at all.27 Harry Cooper, “Plastic Surgery Clinic… in 1945,” KTB #209, Sharkhunters: theOfficial Publication of the U-Bootwaffe, p. 14.28 Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile (Lyle Stuart, Inc. 1981), p. 204.29 Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, pp. 204-205, emphasis added.30 Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, pp. 205-206, emphasis added.31 Ibid., p. 211.32 SA, i.e., Special Agent.33 Needless to say, the editors of the series of essays in the book in whichthis document appears do not accept the scenario of Bormann’s survival, based onother correspondence between British MI-5 and MI-6 and the FBI; the Britishdenied having any knowledge of Bormann’s whereabouts.

While a rare aircraft, the Ta-152 did see combat and was the equal if notbetter of the American P-51 Mustang, an extraordinarily reliable, sturdy, anddeadly fighter in its own right. But Tank also designed, during the war, aturbojet fighter aircraft that bears an all-too-peculiar resemblance to theSoviet MIG-15. Under Tank’s direction, Argentina produced its own independentprototype version of a similar fighter jet aircraft in the early 1950s.49 Cited in Henry Stevens, Hitler’s Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons,Science, and Technology, p. 263, emphasis added.50 Stevens, Hitler’s Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons, Science, andTechnology, p. 263.

And a case could be made that the Russians came up with the idea andthe first primitive sets in the late 1920s. But Dr. Farnsworth clearly impactedits development significantly, by patenting a whole range of tubes, cameras, andequipment that made it commercially viable and reliable.

Hoagland and Mike Bara1 The sudden though very covert interest shown in the work of Dr. Ronald Richterby the U.S. Air Force in 1956 came at a particularly tense period in the earlyCold War of the mid-1950s. In 1956, the Space Race was already up and running,though few people actually knew about it. Behind the scenes, however, there wasfrenetic activity as both superpowers raced to be the first into space, andultimately, to the moon. A year later, on October 4, 1957, the Russians won thefirst significant leg of the race by orbiting mankind’s first artificialsatellite, Sputnik. This behind-the-scenes space race activity provides thenecessary context from which to the U.S. Air Force’s sudden interest in Dr.Richter, for certainly his conceptions concerning the zero point energy wouldhave been of great interest to America’s space program. Moreover, if the AirForce quietly suspected that his project at Huemul represented a continuation ofaspects of the Bell project, with its obvious potential for propulsion and“anti-gravity,” not to mention its weaponization potential, then this tooexplains the American interest.That interest also implies that not all was straightforward and transparent aswas alleged for America’s early space program, and no authors have insisted moreupon that point than New York Times bestselling authors Richard C. Hoagland andMike Bara, with their book Dark Mission: The Secret History of NASA. However,why talk about NASA at all in a book dealing with the postwar survival andinfluence of a “Nazi International”? That there were “former” Nazis in NASA insome very prominent positions everyone knows, but to maintain that they actuallyinfluenced NASA in a “pro-Nazi direction” seems to stretch the bounds ofplausibility. But that influence is precisely what Hoagland’s and Bara’s DarkMission is in part about, and when their research is viewed against the largercontext of postwar Nazi activities outlined here, the implications are stunning,and chilling, indeed.A. Ancient Names and Ritual Alignments Any attempt to summarize Richard Hoagland’s work on NASA’s ongoing cover-up ofspace anomalies in one short chapter would, of course, be doomed to failure.After all, that work has been ongoing for over a quarter of a century, and hasengaged several scholars and experts from a variety of disciplines andspecialties. And, of course, any attempt to summarize his and coauthor MikeBara’s Dark Mission would be similarly doomed, for a similar reason: the book isover five hundred pages long. But their book is directly relevant to thequestion of the existence – or non-existence – of Martin Bormann’s NaziInternational, for as we shall now see, they argue persuasively that the Nazisnot only exhibited a great degree of influence inside of NASA during the heydayof its formation up to the Apollo Moon landings, but indeed, that the Nazisexercised the greatest influence inside the organization, eventually co-opting –or making common cause with – two other significant, hidden, and esotericinfluences in the space agency.With this said, however, a caveat is also required:Hoagland’s and Bara’s book is a complex book, a tapestry of very discreet typesof evidence and argument, and a subtle pattern of historical analysis andvarious themes. By concentrating on only three of those themes - namely,Hoagland’s “ritual alignments” model, the suppression of the hidden purposes andmotivation for NASA and the role of Kennedy in trying to change some aspects ofthose hidden purposes, and finally, the role of three esoteric groups jockeyingfor ultimate power in the agency – we are perforce distorting that tapestry andthe densely-knotted fabric of Hoagland’s and Bara’s arguments and analyses. Nosummary of this nature can substitute, therefore, for an actual reading of thebook.By the same token, however, when their remarks concerning these themes areplaced into the wider historical context of Bormann’s strategic evacuationplans, the demonstrable role of postwar Nazis penetrating and exploiting areasof geopolitical conflict, their equally demonstrable role in the postwareconomic recovery of West Germany, the highly dubious behavior of West Germanyand Neo-Nazi groups prior to, during, and after the forced annexation of EastGermany during the reunification, the demonstrable role of Nazis in supportingand fomenting Muslim radicalism and terrorism, not to mention the self-evidentNazi influence in Dr. Richter’s postwar “fusion” project in Argentina, and theactual physics it really represents, then their remarks not only take on a newand ominous significance, but also serve to corroborate the existence of thatInternational and to highlight some of its goals and agendas.1. NASA and NACA: “Never A Straight Answer” from “Not A Civilian Agency” One of the facts in Dark Mission that literally leaps off the page is that NASAis not, and was never intended to be, at its innermost core and highest levels,a civilian agency:> The governmental institution known as NASA is a department of the Executive> Branch, ultimately answerable solely to the President of the United States, an> Agency created through the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958. NASA> ostensibly is “a civilian agency exercising control over aeronautical and> space activities sponsored by the United State.”> But contrary to common public and media perception that NASA is an open,> strictly civilian scientific institution, is the legal fact that the Space> Agency was quietly founded as a direct adjunct to the Department of Defense,> tasked with specifically assisting the national security of the United States> in the midst of a deepening Cold War with its major geopolitical adversary,> the Soviet Union. It says so right in the original NASA Charter:> “Sec. 305…(i) The (National Aeronautics and Space) Administration shall be> considered a defense agency of the United States for the purpose of Chapter> 17, Title 35 of the United States Code…”(Emphasis added.)> In another section of the act, this seldom-discussed defense responsibility –> the ultimate undercutting of NASA’s continuing public façade as a strictly> civilian, scientific agency – is blatantly spelled out:> “Sec. 205…(d) No (NASA) information which has been classified for reasons of> national security shall be included in any report made under this section (of> the Act)…”(Emphasis added.)> Clearly, from this and the other security provisions incorporated in the Act,> what the Congress, the press and the American taxpayers get to see of NASA’s> ultimate activities - including untouched images and data regarding what’s> really on the Moon, on Mars or anywhere else across the solar system – is> totally dependent on whether the President of the United States (and/or his> legal surrogates in the Department of Defense and the “intelligence> community”) has already secretly classified that data.2 This ability of NASA to cloak or classify data returned from its manned andunmanned probes is the heart of the controversy that has raged between Hoagland,Carlotto, and other researchers of space anomalies such as the “Mars Face” andother strange features in Cydonia, one the one hand, and NASA on the other.2. Masons, Magicians, and Nazis This cloaking-by-classification, however, is further compounded by theintroduction of three parties of powers within NASA that would have their ownreasons and agendas for doing so. Over the course of years of research, Hoaglandand Bara identified three groups, each with their own connections deep withinthe world of occult and esoteric traditions, that each held significantpositions of managerial power and influence within NASA: Masons, Magicians, andNazis. The Nazi aspect of NASA was, of course, self-evident and even well-knownin popular culture, and even called forth some biting satirical criticism andhumor in some segments of American society.3 But less well known were the othertwo occult and esoteric-based groups, the Masons and Magicians. As Hoagland andBara put it:> Let us be clear:> We are uniformly, unabashedly “conspiracy theorists,” and have – against our> wills – become truly convinced that there has been a conscious, carefully> planned and permanent cover-up by NASA of some of its most extraordinary> discoveries made in the course of the Agency’s forty-year history.4All this, of course, implies that there was a secret agenda to the early spacerace, one having nothing whatsoever to do with beating the Soviet Union to theMoon:> Based on our analysis as presented in (Dark Mission: the Secret History of> NASA), it is also our opinion that NASA’s entire lunar expedition program –> culminating with the incredibly successful manned Apollo Project – was> carefully conceived, from the beginning, as a kind of ‘alien reconnaissance’> followed by an ‘alien artifacts retrieval program.5 But who would have conceived, at that early date, such a covert agenda for theMoon landings?Their answer is, again, direct, and laden with implications:> The enthusiastic architects of the continuing NASA … cover-up, in part, are> the same heroes we have been encouraged to worship as some of the leading> pioneers of our technological era. Their names are synonymous with America’s> achievements in space science and rocket engineering. In many cases, they are> also men with secret pasts – Germans, Egyptians, Englishmen and Americans, men> at the very fringes of rational thought and conventional wisdom. These literal> “fringe elements,” then, are divided into three major groups inside the> Agency, as best as we can tell at present. For the purposes of this volume, we> shall call them the “Magicians,” the “Masons,” and the “Nazis” – and deal with> each group separately.> Each “sect” is led by prominent individuals, and supported by lesser known> players. Each has stamped their own agenda on our space program, in indelible> but traceable ways. And each, remarkably, is dominated by a secret or “occult”> doctrine, that is far more closely aligned with “ancient religion and> mysticism” than it is with the rational science and cool empiricism these men> promote to the general public as NASA’s overriding mantra.6 For Hoagland and Bara, these three groups may be more or less headquartered orconcentrated in the following areas of NASA:> 1) The Magicians, represented by rocket engineer and solid-fuel expert Jack> Parsons, with his own direct and personal involvement with notorious British> magician Aleister Crowley, the Ordo Templi Orientis and his Golden Dawn> magicians. Parsons was well-known to have connections to other practicing> occultists, such as L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of “Scientology,” and to have> practiced himself on numerous occasions black magic and sex magic rituals. The> influence of Parsons and “the Magicians” runs directly from Parsons to the Jet> Propulsion Laboratory and other NASA centers clustered around it or directly> tied to it;> 2) The Masons, represented by famous NASA director during the formative> Mercury-Gemini-Apollo years, James Webb, and by various astronauts like Buzz> Aldrin, the second man on the Moon, who were all Masons. The Masonic influence> was, according to Hoagland and Bara, felt throughout NASA not only in Webb’s> largely successful attempts to “democratize” NASA and raise public interest> and awareness of space science in public schools throughout the country, but> also in the esoteric influence it wielded in the selection of mission names,> mission patches and logos, and throughout the astronaut corps, about which> more in a moment. The Masonic influence is thus centered upon the central NASA> bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. and, at that time, within the astronaut corps> itself. In typical Masonic fashion, it was a dispersed influence rather like> the system of Masonic lodges;> 3) The Nazis, represented by prominent German scientists such as Von Braun,> Arthur Rudolf, Kurt Debus, and space medicine specialists such as Hubertus> Strughold, and so on. This influence was centered around Von Braun and his> team, first in the immediate postwar years in New Mexico, later in Alabama and> other installations with prominent Nazi presence. Hoagland’s and Bara’s documentation of the esoteric influence being exertedquietly and behind the scenes by these three groups is itself worth considering.3. Mission Patches, Ancient Names, and Ritual Alignmentsa. Mission Patches Three of the most compelling sets of evidence they adduce for the quiet exerciseof this hidden occult influence are in the forms of mission names and patchlogos, and the pervasive use of names derived from classical Egyptian or Greekmythology on the one hand, and the “ritual alignments” model on the other.> For instance, if one looks at the official patch for the Apollo Program> (below), armed with out preceding “heads-up” regarding the bizarre NASA focus> on all things “Egyptian,” it becomes elemental to match the “A” (for “Apollo”)> as an actual stand-in for “Asar” – the Egyptian designation for “Osiris.” This> successful decoding of the hidden Egyptian meaning of the Apollo patch is> redundantly confirmed – because “Asar/Orisir” is none other than the familiar> Greek constellation of “Orion” – which is, of course, the background stellar> constellation in the patch itself.> In case you think such ritual symbolism is some kind of temporary historical> aberration, confined only to the Apollo Program and the 1960s, think again;> when NASA recently selected a patch design for its new “CEV” spacecraft, which> will eventually replace the Shuttle – and ultimately take American astronauts> back to the Moon, look what NASA curiously picked again (below).7 Hoagland and Bara then reproduce NASA’s own patch designs:image [images/00063.jpg] Apollo and Orion Mission Patches Depicting the Constellation Orion in the ApolloPatch, and the Three Stars of Orion’s Belt in the Orion Patch8 They then comment on the Apollo patch as follows:> In looking at the patch, it struck Hoagland just how incongruent it was with> the stated goals and mythology of NASA’s official Apollo Program to the Moon.> The patch depicts the Earth and Moon, with a flight path tracing from Cape> Canaveral to a landing spot on the Moon. The lunar disk is overlaid with a> mythological deity – presumably Apollo – and there is a large “A” in the> center of the patch. The design was built around a very curious feature – the> constellation of Orion, with its three distinctive belt stars comprising the> bar in “A”.9 The history of the official adoption of the names for NASA’s step-by-step mannedspace program - Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo – that would culminate with mannedlandings on the Moon only served to highlight the strangeness of the ApolloProgram “logo,” for the project names were deliberately adopted by AbeSilverstein from Graeco-Roman mythology at a conference in July of 1960.10Hoagland looked closer, and the names “Mercury” and “Gemini” quickly revealedtheir own strangeness:> As far as the mythology goes, Mercury, the gods’ messenger, seems appropriate> for the single man capsule and its quick missions. Yet the NASA symbol for> Project Mercury is a representation of the element mercury, rather than the> Greek god Mercury, and is similar to a stylized Egyptian ankh… Alchemists> considered mercury the “first matter” from which all other metals were> derived. So was this a dual, alchemical meaning for the name “Project> Mercury?”> Gemini, which means “the twins” in Latin, could not only refer to the two-man> capsule, but also to the rendezvous and docking procedures which were> perfected on Project Gemini and which were crucial to the later Apollo> missions to the Moon. Gemini is also frequently referenced to the> constellation that borders Orion and boasts the twin stars Castor and Pollux> as its most prominent features; other myths link Castor and Pollux with the> morning and evening stars (the planet Venus).> Certainly, there is an inherent “duality” with all of these associations that> well fits the “twins” designation of the NASA Program. Two astronauts… two> vehicles rendezvousing in space… the twin stars Castor and Pollux.11 But it was the Apollo patch that remained anomalously strange.b. Ancient Names Why call NASA’s earliest manned space flight programs Apollo – or for thatmatter, Mercury and Gemini – at all? Why the classical mythological andastrological focus? And why call it Apollo at all when the very constellationdepicted in the patch is Orion? Hoagland consulted a “semi-official book” on theMoon program, which included a short citation from World Book Encyclopediadescribing the mythological associations of Orion. Orion, the “mighty hunter,”was the son of the Graeco-Roman god of the sea Poseidon-Neptune. The goddessArtemis-Diana fell in love with Orion, but her brother, Apollo, took exceptionto this and tricked Artemis-Diana into killing Orion.12And at this point in the “semi-official” history of the Moon program, theobvious question occurred:> Even this description, full of line after line about “Orion” compared to a> single mention of Apollo shows how much more important Orion is to the patch> than Apollo. So why call the Program “Apollo” at all? And why name the program> after a petulant “god” who tricks his sister into murdering her lover? Is this> the image NASA wanted of its first space pioneers, rather than the mighty> hunter Orion? Why not just call the Project “Orion”? No matter how you look at> it, the Greco-Roman designation of Apollo just doesn’t fit such a noble and> risky venture as Man’s first foray to another world.13 The deliberate mixing of an Egyptian reference in the Apollo Program “logo,”however, is significant, for Orion is, of course, another reference to Osiris,who plays such a central role in the Egyptian death-and-resurrection myth, andin that myth, there was a direct connection to the Moon.For those who do not know the basic outlines of this legend, Osiris was murdered(again through a trick) at the hands of his brother, Set, symbolized by theconstellation Taurus. Vengeance is taken upon Set-Taurus by the Osiris’ son,Horus, represented by the constellation Leo, while Osiris’ wife Isis,represented by the star Sirius and in some cases “associated with the Moon,”14resurrects Osiris.The story, Hoagland and Bara comment, is laden with “paleophysical” meanings,for it is> Full of astronomical references, including hints (via key “coded” numbers in> the narratives) that the Egyptians fully understood the concepts of> precession, lunar cycles and stellar motion. There are also strong hints that> these beings were not mythical “gods” at all, but rather real flesh and blood> beings from an advanced civilization that visited Earth in antediluvian> times.15 As anyone who has read my own book The Cosmic War: Interplanetary Warfare,Modern Physics, and Ancient Texts, such an interpretation is not at all out ofsynch with ancient texts, for that is in fact what those texts themselves state.Both Egypt and Sumer viewed themselves as a legacy – and a declined one at that– from something far more ancient and much more sophisticated. As those textsindicate, the “gods” indeed taught early mankind the arts, and some of theiradvanced sciences, of civilization. And as I also demonstrated in part three ofmy previous book The Philosophers’ Stone: The American “Gold,” The Soviet“Mercury,” and the Nazi “Serum,” such interpretations of these texts was commoncurrency in the esoteric circles and secret societies hovering in the backgroundof the Nazi Party.But that left the initial question even more starkly outlined:> What is a mythological Egyptian stellar deity doing representing an official> U.S. governmental exploration of the Moon? And in a program known under the> designation of a Greek ‘sun god,’ Apollo. Why not, for example, “Diana” – the> Greek goddess of the Moon?> The initial answer is quite simple: “Apollo” is actually “Horus” – if one> examines in detail Greek mythological literature and its derivations from he> earlier Egyptian. Horus, like Apollo, is the Egyptian “god of the sun” (and> also, curiously, ruled over Mars).16 Thus, it turns out that the $20 billion> NASA Apollo Exploration Program of the Moon was, in fact, nothing less than a> disguised “Osiris/Horus Lunar Landing Program”… straight out of ancient> Egypt.17 But why associate the Egyptian god of rebirth and resurrection, Osiris, via hisson Horus-Apollo, to this program at all?> It was only after Hoagland noted the name of another space vehicle – the> shuttle Atlantis – that he began to put the pieces together. What if this> wasn’t the first time Man had reached across space to touch the Moon? What if> the ancient Egyptian “Zep-Tepi” (literally, “the first time”) Era of> Osiris/Isis/Horus was not a myth… but a reality?18 In other words, the very choice of the Apollo Program “logo” and its very name,“Apollo” itself, symbolized the covert mission of the program, namely, toreconnoiter and recover technology from that lost “first time.”With this key in hand, Hoagland began to search the record for other Egyptianconnections in the names associated with the Apollo program.And, he found them.The Lunar Module of Apollo 15 was named “Falcon,” and “Falcon of the Horizon”was, of course, one of the titles of Horus.19 Additionally, “the Apollo 16(Lunar Excursion Module) had been openly named ‘Orion.’”20 The Apollo commandmodule Columbia “drew its name from St. Columba – a sixth-century monk who, inMasonic lore, brought a ‘scared stone’…to Scotland from Egypt.”21c. Ritual Alignments But program “logos” and Egyptian connections were not all that Hoaglanddiscovered. Perhaps the most significant indicator – if not surely one of themost controversial – was his discovery that NASA’s Moon landings appeared tohave been deliberately coordinated with astrological significances in mind. Thekey mission that tipped him off, as far as the Moon program was concerned, wasApollo Ten. Here is it necessary to cite Dark Mission at length:> With all of the primary technical and mission planning components having been> tested and proven out, the next mission was a full-up dress rehearsal for> Apollo 11. Launched May 18, 1969, Apollo 10 acted as a pathfinder for Apollo> 11’s “Eagle,” following the same descent path that Apollo 11 would two months> later. Eventually, Thomas P. Stafford piloted Snoopy to within 8.4 miles of> the lunar surface (about 44,000 feet), prompting Lunar Module Pilot Gene> Cernan to comment ominously; “Man, we’s getting down among them.”> Given that their altitude was nearly 50,000 feet above the lunar surface we> can’t help but wonder what Cernan was talking about. At that altitude, lunar> surface features, even mountains, would be obscure and far away. However,> given where Stafford and Cernan were at that moment, passing through Sinus> Medii and heading on toward Mare Smythii, the only thing they could have been> “down among” – at 50,000 feet – would be Hoagland’s theorized miles high glass> domes. Undeniably, the location and the altitude would be correct for that to> be what Cernan was talking about.> This bizarre comment also raises the other strangely incongruous aspect of> Apollo 10; while the spacecraft was theoretically fully capable of landing on> the Moon, inexplicably, it was not given the capability to do so.> Not only was the Mission denied the fuel to make a safe lunar landing (the> tanks on-board were literally only half-filled, but the (Lunar Module)> “Snoopy” was a crippled version of the “real” vehicle, unable to physically> land on the lunar surface.> Politically, this makes no sense.> Still in a fierce race with the Soviet Union to be the first to land a man on> the Moon, Apollo 10 had everything necessary to accomplish this long sought> after political goal – except, the tools to do so. The Saturn V, the (Lunar> Module) and the (Command Service Module) had all been tested on previous> missions, and the NASA long-distance (lunar) communications network was tested> on Apollo 8. There was no practical, canonical reason not to land Apollo 10.> With only two more shots at making the goal Kennedy’s “end of the decade,” the> question is, why wait?> As he delved ever deeper into the arcane, Egyptian mysteries surrounding these> supposedly secular, “scientific and engineering” NASA missions, Hoagland> finally found his answer:> Because it wasn’t “time” yet.22 In other words, the only way to explain why Apollo 10 had not been given themission assignment to make a lunar landing was quite simply that it did notfulfill some hidden requirement of the esoteric Egyptian agendas apparentlydriving or influencing NASA planning at a very deep level.Testing this hypothesis, Hoagland began to enter data into computer programsdesigned to show astronomical alignments. The result stunned him, for at theexact moment that Buzz Aldrin celebrated his now famous “communion ceremony” onthe Moon, Sirius, stellar symbol of Isis, resurrector and consort of Osiris, wasat 19.5 degrees elevation from the horizon. And 19.5 was one of the key numbers“encoding” a hyper-dimensional tetrahedral physics.23 Furthermore, this impliedthat well before the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 196924 there were individualswithin NASA who were fully informed about aspects of this hyper-dimensionalphysics.25 To give the esoteric and numerological connections even more weight,Hoagland also noted that Aldrin’s communion ceremony took place exactly 33minutes after “the Eagle had landed.”26 And Aldrin was one of the astronauts whowas a Mason. The odds against all this being coincidental are, of course, quitehigh. Further investigation yielded similar Egyptian astronomical correlationsfor Apollo 12.27These alignments implied something else, and something extraordinarilysignificant. Consider only the complex degree of planning and coordination thathas to occur in order for such a mission to be pre-planned:> Going to the Moon(or any other planet) with current propulsion technology> (such as Apollo’s Saturn V), requires a tremendous amount of careful and prior> mission planning. Because fuel and rocket thrust are very limited, leaving for> a specific planetary designation with a precisely-timed pre-planned arrival> time and specific landing site in mind, requires an immense amount of detailed> knowledge of key “celestial mechanics.” This encompasses all relative> planetary and spacecraft motions, ranging from precise planetary orbits, to> planned spacecraft departure and arrival times, to the individual planetary> rotation rates themselves. The latter critically impact mission departure and> arrival times, if not the intended landing site geometry itself.28 Bluntly put, these considerations meant nothing less than that theastronomical-astrological alignments exhibited by these landings “must have hadthe highest mission planning priority, over all other publicly stated goals ofthe Apollo landing program. They would have to be given top priority over allother objectives, be they political, general mission science, specific lunargeological sampling and even crew safety.”29Even the man who trained the astronauts and who ultimately selected them had hisown Egyptian connections; in fact, he, Farouk El-Baz, was Egyptian! Moreover,his father was an expert in Egyptian religion and particularly its astronomicalsymbolisms.30 There were even ritual alignments operative when President Kennedymade his famous speech before Congress, setting the goal of reaching the Moonbefore the decade was out, for as it turned out, those alignments, coupled withApollo 12’s and Surveyor 3’s landing site, fixed an “entire ‘lunar ritualnetwork.’”31And this was the vital clue that would eventually “provide a crucial clue as tojust ‘who’ was running this entire ‘hijack operation,’”32 for this was the keythat led Hoagland to the Masons and the Magicians.33 Indeed, all three groupscould claim a justifiable interest in esoteric matters as a part of theirpedigree, and thus, Hoagland and Bara concluded that, at a very early periodeven before the founding of NASA itself, these three groups made common causeand “literally (stole) the entire space program for themselves from the rest ofall mankind – ‘Space’ is destined to remain the sole possession of only thosewith these ‘proper bloodlines and perspectives’…but not for any of the rest ofus.”34d. The Biggest “Ritual Alignment” of them All However, if there was a “common cause” and a covert agreement to “share space”that grew out of all three groups’ well-known connections to and preoccupationwith ancient esotericism, which group was, or became, the dominant one?Hoagland’s and Bara’s answer to that question are stunning, and chilling. Notingthat two of the crucial landings, Surveyor 3 and Apollo 16 – the first of whichhad indeed helped fix the entire lunar landing ritual grid – actually occurredon April 20, 1967 and 1972 respectively, they drew the immediate reference:April 20 was Adolf Hitler’s birthday.Again, put this in the context of the detailed and complex planning required toland a particular spacecraft on a particular day and time on another planet, andat a particular place. Such landings could not be accidental. Moreover, theyalso discovered that the Apollo 16 Lunar Excursion module was named “Orion,”which, when combined with the obvious symbolism of a landing on Hitler’sbirthday, strongly suggested a “potential ‘resurrection,’ specifically on hisbirthday, of ‘something’ in the name of Hitler.”35Given the esoteric ideology of Nazism itself, an ideology that, in HeinrichHimmler’s “Ancestral Research Bureau” sought to trace German ancestry back tothe Ayran race they believed to have colonized Sumer and Egypt, the conclusionfor Hoagland and Bara was inescapable, and it is best to allow them to tell itin their own words:> This new “ritual coincidence,” a second NASA mission deliberately landed on> the day of Hitler’s birth, finally brought the astonishing set of alignments> into crystal clear, sharp focus. For, by these repeated “ritual coincidences,”> – commemorating the infamous Leader of the Third Reich – the key players> behind this entire NASA lunar ritual were now overwhelmingly identified as> none other than the NASA members of the former Reich. NASA – at the highest> levels – had effectively been “taken over” from the Masons by Von Braun.> Further, it was now clear from the “ritual timing” of Kennedy’s critical> address to that joint Congressional session (May 25, 1961), that the Nazis had> carefully set up the President on what the real objectives of Apollo would> become, including the insitu reconnaissance and return to Earth of artifacts> from the ancient ruins that the Nazis somehow knew about and clearly viewed as> being left –> By their own ancestors!> No wonder Kennedy was murdered, immediately after his repeated offer to share> this priceless “Nazi heritage” with their worst enemies, the Russians, was> finally accepted.36 Nor can this conclusion, astonishing, stunning, and chilling as it is, and giventhe entire context of this book and my previous books on Nazi secret weapons andpostwar survival, be too readily dismissed. In fact, it is the one conclusionthat most fits the wider tapestry of evidence examined here and in those otherbooks.4. A Stunning and Chilling Scenario: The Implications of the Dark MissionConclusions Regarding the Nazis This all suggests a very carefully planned long-range scenario, carefullyscripted in the last days of Hitler’s Third Reich. In what now follows, I wishto make clear that the proposed scenario is my own, and not Mr. Hoagland’s orMr. Bara’s, though it is certainly suggested by their own research, as well asmy own previous research on the subject of Nazi secret weapons and the Bell.Consider the careful long-range planning for and implications of the totalscenario I have presented here and elsewhere. Bormann and Kammler plottedcarefully to insure that the best rocket scientists would go to America, alongwith most of the plans and blueprints for advanced rockets, while the Sovietsgot hundreds of middle echelon draftsmen, technicians, and engineers who wouldallow the Russians to reconstruct the paper trail and begin their own spaceprogram. Bormann transferred priceless enriched uranium-235 for America’s atombomb program to the United States via the U-234, and using the security he knewwould be afforded to that cargo, in all likelihood smuggled himself and HeinrichMüller to safety. Meanwhile, the noted German atomic scientist Baron Manfred VonArdenne made his way to the Soviet Union, where he assisted the Russians ontheir atom bomb project, eventually becoming the only non-Russian to win theStalin Prize for science – the Soviet Union’s equivalent of the Nobel Prize – inrecognition for his efforts in the Soviet bomb program. Similar “equaldivisions” of the spoils of German technology in aeronautics were alsoengineered.Bormann, however, saw to it that Kammler had direct control of LuftwaffeKampfgeschwader 200, giving him control over Germany’s last remaining JU 390,the only plane capable of flying a heavy load – the Bell and/or its pricelessproject documentation – from Europe to Latin America, where, curiously, we findafter the war Richter’s strange project involving plasmas and, ostensibly,“fusion,” and where we also find Martin Bormann according to the Argentine andFBI documents examined earlier. Succinctly stated, Bormann saw to it that theNazis kept the best technology, and its future development, to themselves.Additionally, we have repeatedly mentioned the “intelligence deal” betweenGeneral Reinhard Gehlen and Allen Dulles, that turned nominal jurisdiction ofGehlen’s vast spy network inside of Eastern Europe over to the nascent AmericanCIA, effectively comprising its civilian charter at the outset, and effectivelystaffing the entire Soviet analytical and operational desk of the CIA in itsearly years with a bunch of Nazis. The deliberate overestimation anddisinformation by Gehlen’s organization of Soviet military and economicpreparedness for war helped fuel the Cold War. And given that the KGB is knownto have “turned” several of Gehlen’s agents into “double” agents for the SovietUnion raises the possibility that these agents in fact remained loyal Nazis allalong, and were furthering a hidden goal of their own, very possibly passingdisinformation back to the Soviets about American “war intentions andpreparations, thus giving the Nazi International a network that penetrated andmanipulated policy on both sides of the Iron Curtain, a hypothesis not withoutits own possibilities of reality, since the German reunification itself waseffected by precisely such coordinated activity on both sides of the IronCurtain.Moreover, there is the Kennedy Assassination itself. As I averred in The SSBrotherhood of the Bell, the Gehlen organization may not only have taken a handin the actual training of Lee Harvey Oswald for his “defection” to the SovietUnion – after all, who else had the experience of operations behind the IronCurtain to the extent that Gehlen’s organization did? – but there is also thematter of Kennedy’s threatening to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces. This,coupled with his offer to go to the Moon jointly with the Soviet Union, tookdirect aim at two of the bureaucracies and fiefdoms into which Nazis hadinfiltrated: NASA, and the CIA. Moreover, such cooperation would have directlythreatened the putative Nazi International with exposure.And consider the other “fingers” pointing to Martin Bormann and his NaziInternational.There is Allen Welsh Dulles himself, a member of the Wall Street elite thathelped establish the technology transfers between the United States and Germany,and the very elite that also helped to establish the enormous monster of theGerman cartel system between World Wars One and Two. Dulles, of course, became adirector of the CIA, remained friends with Gehlen, and was fired by Kennedy forhis part in the disastrously unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. Yet,even with these “conflicts of interest,” Lyndon Johnson appointed him as amember of the Warren Commission investigating Kennedy’s death. And present withhim as a member of that Commission was John J. McCloy, former Allied HighCommissioner for occupied Germany, and a former lawyer for I.G. Farben’sinterests in America!And then there is Wehrner Von Braun. Hoagland and Bara have strongly stated thatthe Nazi motivation for the recovery of alien technology from the Moon was notonly a hidden agenda of the Apollo missions, but a real ideological objective ofthe Nazi Party. But there is more evidence of this fact than inference. As Ipointed out in my book Secrets of the Unified Field, Von Braun was a prominentmember, if not the guiding force, on the Project Orbiter Committee, the veryPentagon Committee that received The Varo Annotated Edition of Morris Jessup’sThe Case for the UFOs, the edition with its strange annotations regardingantigravity, the Philadelphia Experiment, and an ancient cosmic war fought inour own solar system.37 By now, it should be obvious, that this, too, is notanother “coincidence.”Small wonder, then, that neither District Attorney Jim Garrison, nor OliverStone in his celebrated movie, JFK, really knew how to deal with the Naziconnection.And equally small wonder that the NASA Nazis were able to land significant lunarmissions on Adolf Hitler’s birthday, a celebration that, as has been seen, wasobserved by other Nazis in Argentina.B The Real Apollo Missions So why did the Apollo missions suddenly end with Apollo 17? After all, therockets for Apollo 18 were already purchased and the money was already spent.Why, with the rockets ready, the astronaut teams ready, did America suddenlycall off further Moon landings? Needless to say, the answers to this questionhave run the entire spectrum of unbelievabilty, from unbelievable governmentexplanations that the “money” or the “interest” was no longer there, tounbelievable internet and conspiracy explanations that “ET” was already on theMoon, and basically told us “meddling humans” to “stay away.”1. Hoagland’s Conclusions In the Epilogue to Dark Mission, Richard C. Hoagland gives a much morebelievable and reasonable explanation for why Apollo was suddenly and by anyaccounts inexplicably cancelled. To put it succinctly, it was “Missionaccomplished,” Apollo had found what it was looking for. NASA “was sendingastronauts to the Moon on an archeological reconnaissance mission, looking tofind the lost power of the gods that may have been left lying around the lunarsurface in the form of instrumentalities from eons past.”38 Hoagland and Barastate the case for the real reason for the abrupt termination of Apollo with asuccinctness that belies the importance of their remarks:> In the years following JFK’s assassination, when Apollo finally became an> engineering reality, only nine successful Apollo missions to and from the Moon> were carried out; only six of those were actually lunar landings.> Then (apparently), a critical number and type of lunar artifacts was> successfully identified, and returned to Earth by the Apollo crews – at which> point the entire Apollo Program was abruptly terminated with Apollo 17.> In our model, it was this successful completion of Apollo’s secret mission and> agenda, and not Congressional budget cuts, which was the real reason for this> abrupt cessation of America’s historic journeys to the Moon, and the primary> reason no one has gone near the lunar surface for over 30 years.39 2. Some Implications of Their Remarks in a Wider Context This conclusion is both plausible and, from the standpoint of the data andanalyses presented in their book, entirely reasonable and believable. But thereis an implication to this conclusion that readers of Dark Mission may havemissed, unless they bear in mind Hoagland’s and Bara’s integrated style ofdiction, where each point is meant to be viewed in the context and in directconnection to all other points in the book. Here Hoagland’s conclusion should betaken in the context of the theme of the three esoteric groups – Masons,Magicians, and Nazis – that vied for power and influence in the agency, namely,that in seeking exotic artifacts and potential technology left by a priorinterplanetary civilization on the Moon, each of these three groups was pursuingan agenda stemming from the esoteric teachings of those groups: that there oncewas a sophisticated and extremely ancient interplanetary civilization based inthe solar system, and that it probably left artifacts of its sophisticatedphysics and technology on worlds in very close proximity to earth.Indeed, as I have noted throughout some of my previous books, one goal of suchsecret societies as the Masons was precisely to “turn the stream” and recoverthis ancient lost knowledge.40 Certainly the same could be said of “theMagicians.” But most importantly, as I have argued elsewhere, the same must besaid of the Nazis, since there is a preponderance of evidence that suggests thattheir most closely held secret weapons projects were attempts to recover aspectsof this lost physics and science.41 By stating that the real goal of Apollo was“an archeological reconnaissance mission” to recover some of this technology,Hoagland is in fact arguing – in my opinion persuasively – that at the minimumthe Nazis not only had obtained the mastery over NASA at this time frame inhistory, but that they were continuing, under its auspices and at the expense ofthe American taxpayer, their own closely held party ideology to recover aspectsof that lost science and technology. The Nazis were, in short, not onlycontinuing the agenda of the very secret societies and occultists that helpedmidwife the Nazi Party into existence, but continuing the investigation of theesoteric science and agenda of projects represented by the Bell. After all, as Ipoint out in SS Brotherhood of the Bell, the Bell Project’s power plantdesigner, Dr. Kurt Debus, wound up as a flight director for NASA at CapeCanaveral during the heyday of the Apollo missions!42 And to celebrate the fact,they landed two Apollo missions on Hitler’s birthday, much like other Naziveterans met in obscure hotels in Argentina every year on the same date!43 Thepattern is the same.Nor does the possibility of some collaboration between the NASA Nazis and theNASA Masons and/or Magicians mitigate this view, for a modus vivendi, a kind of“esoteric detente” could have been reached allowing each group to share in thespoils of esoteric knowledge and/or artifacts gained. But as Hoagland and Baramake clear, however, by the time of the Hitler’s Birthday Moon Landings, theNazis have gained the upper hand in mission planning and agendas.3. The Wider Implications That fact, given the wider context of this book, means that all aspects of thewartime Nazi agenda were in fact intact and being deliberately pursued after thewar by postwar Nazis, and this, in turn, is yet another argument that the Naziideology survived the war not only intact, but with enough organizational andfiscal health to continue those agendas – from the exploitation of conflict tothe exploration and exploitation of space – without scarcely missing a beat.And more importantly, it also indicates that the two track space program - theone with rockets for public consumption represented by Apollo (with its ownhidden archaeological agenda), and the secret one with exotic physics andalternative technologies, represented by the Bell, Dr. Richter, and the presenceof the Bell project’s power plant designer as key a NASA flight director, Dr.Kurt Debus — was alive and well.1 Richard C.

Here,however, the summary and conclusions suggest a scenario, which may be weavedtogether by considering all the various authors’ research that I have outlinedhere as well as in my previous books on wartime Nazi secret weapons research,Reich of the Black Sun, The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, Secrets of the UnifiedField, and The Philosophers’ Stone. That scenario may best be summarized, not ina series of itemized conclusions, but by outlining the timeline of events. Indoing so, I shall present the actual events themselves in normal type face, andmy or others’ interpretations of those events, whether conjectured or actual, initalics.A. 1920s – 1930s:Alchemy, Esotericism, the SS, and theUnified Field Theory Craze > 1. 1920s: The Thule Gesellschaft and other secret societies help midwife the> Nazi Party into existence; during the 1920s, there is a persistent and public> interest in alchemy, and members of the Nazi Party, including General Erich> Ludendorff, financially back the alchemist Tausend’s alchemical experiments.> This causes a public scandal and fraud trial in Germany, which is covered by> the international press.2> 2. 1920s: At this same time period, scientists in Japan and more importantly,> Germany, are investigating evidences of alchemical-like transmutations in the> laboratory and publishing serious scientific papers on the subject, with many> German firms taking out patents on various transmutation processes.3> 3. 1921: During this time period, German mathematician Theodor Franz Eduard> Kaluza publishes the first hyper-dimensional Unified Field Theory of> electromagnetism and gravitation, a theory that relied on a five-dimensional> “cylindrical” geometry to achieve the unification. Einstein eventually backs> publication of the theory in the journal of The Prussian Academy of Sciences,> and begins his own investigations of hyper-dimensional unified field theory.4> 4. 1933-1935: With the Nazi accession to power in 1933 and the formation of> the SS Ahnenerbedienst by Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler in 1935, Nazi> Germany becomes the first modern state to commit serious financial resources> and personnel into the investigation of esoteric traditions for their> potential military exploitation.5> 5. 1924: Nobel Laureate Dr. Walther Gerlach writes openly about scientific> alchemy in a Frankfurt newspaper, calling openly for further funding for> research into the phenomenon. Gerlach’s specialty in physics is in rotating> electromagnetic systems and gravity.6> 6. 1928: Einstein publishes a “full” version of his own thoughts on Unified> Field Theory in an important paper in 1928. This version of the theory> incorporates the “torsion tensor” with a geometry that spirals, folds, and> pleats the fabric of space-time.7> 7. 1933-1935: Occultist Karl Maria Wiligut, whose writings contain alchemical> and physics speculations as well as statements of belief in an extremely> ancient Very High Civilization, becomes a personal advisor to Heinrich> Himmler.8> 8. 1935: Hungarian electrical engineer Gabriel Kron publishes a paper> demonstrating that anomalous phenomena in rotating electrical machinery and> electrical networks can only be explained by recourse to Einstein’s Unified> Field theory. For this paper he wins the prestigious Montefiore Prize from the> University of Liege in Belgium.> 9. 1938-1939: Reichsführer SS Himmler personally backs and sponsors the> Schäffer expedition to Tibet. The German team actually gains entry to the> Potala in Lhasa, and returns to Germany with the only complete copy of the> ancient Tibetan epic, the Kang Shuur, said to contain information on a lost> high civilization, to a western nation.9> From these considerations it will be evident that within the general German> culture of the 1920s and 1930s, there was a current of profound social and> scientific interest in alchemy and other forms of esotericism, and in the> possible scientific and physics explanations for alchemical claims. As is also> evident, this public interest translated into an organized effort within the> SS to fund and investigate all avenues of esotericism for military> exploitation. As I noted in Reich of the Black Sun, this bureaucratic culture> issued in much more foolishness than successes, but it is also unlikely that> the successes were ever publicized.10> Within this overall climate of scientific opinion, Kron’s 1935 paper made> obvious the implication that Unified Field Theory effects could be locally> engineered on the laboratory bench. Thus, a powerful climate of opinion was> created that, within the “mission brief” of Himmler’s SS, probably found> expression in the funding for the research of exotic physics. Similarly,> Kron’s paper would have attracted the attention of American “science projects> Tsar” Vannevar Bush, President Franklin Roosevelt’s science advisor. In all> likelihood, these scientific impulses became the impetus for America’s> Philadelphia Experiment and Nazi Germany’s Bell project, both of which are> rationalizable from the same physics basis.B. 1943-1945: Strange Events from the Middle to the End of World War Two > 1. January – July, 1943: A Japanese communiqué between Stockholm and Tokyo> report that the Germans are using an “atom bomb” on the Eastern Front, and> specifically mention their use in the Crimea and during the Battle of Kursk in> July, 1943.11 Otto Skorzeny in his memoirs also confirms the German use of> fuel-air bombs in rocket artillery batteries during the German offensive on> Moscow in 194112 In the wake of the Stalingrad debacle, many Nazi leaders> quietly begin evacuating liquid capital and other resources to neutral safe> havens outside the Reich.> 2. ca. January 1943: Other vague reports indicate the testing of a “scalar”> weapon of some sort, most likely by Germany, on the southern Eastern Front in> the aftermath of the Soviet encirclement of Stalingrad.13> 3. September – October, 1943: The American full-scale version of the> Philadelphia Experiment is performed, achieving its highly anomalous results> of optical invisibility of an entire destroyed escort class ship.14> 4. July 20, 1944: The Bomb plot against Adolf Hitler fails. General Otto Remer> remains loyal to the Nazi Regime in Berlin, foiling the putsch attempt.> 5. ca. October 10, 1944: Germany allegedly tests a nuclear bomb on or near the> island of Rügen in the Baltic Sea; the test is witnessed by an Italian liaison> officer to Wehrmacht headquarters, Luigi Romersa.15 Britain during this same> time frame places the whole country on secret alert against the possibility of> a German atom bomb attack, as postwar press reports revealed.16> 6. mid-1944: Nazi Germany also tests a large “liquid air bomb” in eastern> Germany or western Poland with a personal representative of Reichsführer> Himmler present; the bomb’s shock wave flattens trees to a distance of 12> kilometers, making it an enormous liquid air bomb, or something else.17> 7. August, 1944: Bormann orchestrates the Hotel Maison Rouge meeting with the> blessings of Adolf Hitler to create a vast system of dummy and front> corporations to evacuate liquid assets, crucial scientific and technical> personnel, and actual technology outside the Reich. Bormann establishes a> system of Nazi party liaisons with German corporations to enforce Party> policies and agendas.> 8. March – April, 1945: Bormann gives command over the Luftwaffe’s> Kamfgschwader 200 and its valuable Junkers 290 and 390 long range aircraft to> SS General Kammler, head of Nazi Germany’s secret weapons projects, including> the Bell.18 Kammler, the Bell, its project documentation, and the Junkers 390,> last seen in Prague in April of 1945, go completely missing at the end of the> war. Bormann’s postwar presence in Bariloche according to the Argentine> documents, and the presence of Richter—and perhaps even Hitler himself—in that> region of Argentina—strongly argue that the Bell and Kammler went, not to the> United States, but to Argentina.> 9. April – May 1 or 2, 1945: The U-234, a cargo U-boat, departs Germany with a> load of enriched uranium-235, infrared proximity fuses, their blueprints, and> inventor, Dr. Heinz Schlicke. The U-boat’s movements after departing Norway> make it highly plausible that it returned covertly to Germany to pick up> Martin Bormann and Heinrich Müller. During the period that the U-boat’s logs> are suspiciously lacking in detailed reports of its movements, there would> have been time for it to convey Bormann and Müller to Nationalist Spain,> where, in turn, they went on to Argentina. In the same time frame, Von Braun> and many top Nazi rocket scientists surrender to American forces, while the> Soviet Union gets many middle echelon rocket technicians. Similarly, Baron> Manfred Von Ardenne decides to cooperate with the Soviets in their atom bomb> program. The Soviet Union also obtained Dr. Hellmann’s radar team, which had> discovered the principles of optical phase conjugation in late war> experiments. These become the basis of postwar Soviet scalar research.19> In the scenario outlined in this book, Bormann had negotiated the surrender of> the uranium and infrared proximity fuses to the United States, and, knowing> that the Americans would “protect” the U-boat, escaped in it. He similarly> arranged for a tidy division of Nazi Germany’s rocket and nuclear spoils> between the eastern and western blocs. Subsequent postwar Nazi and Neo-Nazi> groups exploit the East-West tensions for their own purposes, which of course> culminated in German reunification – basically an annexation of East Germany> by West Germany – in 1989-1991.> 10. Late April – Early May, 1945: Advance units of General George S. Patton’s> American Third Army enter Czechoslovakia and the Skoda works at Pilsen, as> well as other secret installations of Kammler’s “secret weapons empire.” While> the SS in all probability “cleaned” these installations of documents and> equipment, nonetheless it would have been readily apparent to American> military intelligence officers with those units that these installations,> about which the Allies knew almost nothing, were centers of deeply black> research projects. Patton, as the commander of the Third Army, would have been> one of the few people in the American command structure with a comprehensive> picture of these projects. He subsequently dies under mysterious> circumstances.> 11. 1945: General Reinhard Gehlen and OSS spymaster Allen Dulles work out the> deal keeping German military intelligence intact and turning it over to the> nominal control of the future CIA. Thus, German military intelligence is the> only organization in the postwar world with significant penetration into the> Eastern and Western Blocs and their security services, making possible a> coordination of actions on both sides of the Iron Curtain when situations> require it.> 12. Late April – Early May, 1945: Several Tibetan monks in SS uniforms found> dead by Russian soldiers entering Berlin.> This requires some commentary. Since the 1938-1939 Schäffer Expedition is> known not to have brought out large numbers of Tibetan monks, but only a copy> of the Kang Shuur, the question becomes, when were these monks smuggled out of> Tibet into Nazi Germany, by what route, and for what purpose? The most likely> possibility was sometime around the period of the massive German offensive on> the southern Russian Front in the summer of 1942. It is a little known fact> that the Wehrmacht sent armed long-range reconnaissance units as far east as> Astrakhan on the northern Caspian Sea, but beyond sewing confusion behind> Russian lines, there was little military value in such an operation.20> However, it is possible that commando-engineer units of the Waffen SS might> have been included in these units, and, once the units had penetrated as far> east as was operationally safe, the commando units would have been released to> continue onward through Kazakstan and on into Tibet, utilizing Nazi> intelligence contacts in these Muslim areas to smooth their passage through> hostile territory. Once in Tibet, a makeshift airfield could have been> constructed able to handle long-range aircraft. The Tibetans would have then> been flown back to Germany. While a hazardous enterprise, to be sure, it would> have been far safer than attempting to smuggle monks out through British India> and back to Germany via U-boat, which, in any case, would have required more> trips than would have been required by even one of the large Junkers 290s or> the enormous Junkers 390s. As for the purpose of such an operation, this is> relatively transparent, for such expertise would have been required if> Himmler’s SS was to translate its copy of the Kang Shuur completely and> accurately.> 13. May 7 and 8, 1945: German Armed Forces under the command of> Reichspräsident and Groβadmiral Karl Dönitz surrender to Allied forces> unconditionally at Reims, France, and in Berlin. No representative of the Nazi> Party or Bormann’s Party Chancellery itself is present at either surrender> ceremony. Indeed, the absence of any such presence at either surrender> ceremony is in itself very loose corroboration that Bormann – now aboard the> U-234 bound for Spain – was nowhere to be found. C. 1946-1961:Postwar Shenanigans > 1. Early 1946: American commando teams enter Czechoslovakia to “recover> documents” and a minor international incident ensues as Czechoslovakia> protests. America allegedly returns the documents.> As I argued in Secrets of the Unified Field, declassified American documents> concerning this incident make it clear that the Czech government did not> believe the American explanation that this incursion was to recover documents> pertinent to the war crimes trials, which Czechoslovakia no doubt would have> turned over if a proper request had been made. Instead, the Czech government> insisted that the documents had to do with sophisticated German radar> technology. Close examination of the documents also reveals confusion in the> upper echelons of the American command structure, since no one knows who gave> the order for the secret incursion, nor why. There are two possible ways to> reconcile all these points: 1) the American incursion was ordered by the OSS> and for its own purposes. Given the contacts with American corporate interests> represented by OSS spymaster Allen Dulles, the incursion may have been to> recover technological documents for his corporate masters; or 2) the incursion> was a “false flag” operation being run by units of the SS, wearing American> uniforms, to recover essential project documents and spirit them out of> Germany. Either possibility, without further evidence in this regard, is in my> opinion equally probable.> 2. July – September 1947: A strange and exotic craft crashes and is recovered> by U.S. military personnel near Roswell, New Mexico. According to the> so-called Cooper-Cantwheel Majic-12 documents, a full U.S. Air Force> investigation occurs, which includes the resident Nazi Paperclip rocket> scientists in New Mexico. Publicly the story is put out that the U.S. has> recovered a “flying saucer” on the orders of the base commander, Col. William> Blanchard (later four star general Blanchard). This story is refuted days> later by other U.S.A.F. personnel including General Roger Ramey.> As I argue in The SS Brotherhood of the Bell and in my Reich of the Black Sun,> however, all the internal evidence of these documents argues that the> recovered technology, while exotic, was not exotic enough to be> extraterrestrial. So what caused the panic in the American military? As> outlined in those books, the technological descriptions of the craft, if they> are to be believed, point clearly and inexorably to similar developments in> Nazi Germany. Thus, the panic becomes understandable, for if something Nazi> was able to enter American airspace over our most sensitive military> installations in 1947 with impunity, then that meant that someone, somewhere> in the world was continuing an independent development of those wartime Nazi> secret projects.21 Some UFOlogists explain Truman’s signing of the National> Security Act of 1947, which created the CIA and NSA, as a response, in part,> to this “alien incursion.” But as I also point out in The SS Brotherhood of> the Bell, the term “National Security Agency” is a direct translation of> Himmler’s Reichsicherheithauptamt, which was also a “central intelligence> agency” clearing house.> 3. mid-1948: The FBI gains reports of Bormann’s survival in Bariloche,> Argentina, and President Truman, at the request of Supreme Court Justice> Jackson, authorizes Hoover’s FBI to investigate the matter. As noted in this> book, this is peculiar, since President Truman had signed the 1947 National> Security Act into law, which gave foreign intelligence operations to the> jurisdiction of the CIA, not the FBI. However, if Truman suspected that the> CIA had already been compromised by Nazis, the choice of the FBI makes perfect> sense.> 4. 1949: The Western Allies – Britain, France, and the United States, grant> sovereignty to the West German Federal Republic and Konrad Adenauer becomes> the first postwar German chancellor. General Gehlen’s spy organization becomes> Germany’s Bundesnachrichtendienst and, for all intents and purposes, the> nucleus of NATO intelligence as well. Gehlen deliberately misinforms the> United States of Soviet strength and intentions, thus helping to exacerbate> the Cold War.> 5. 1951: Argentine dictator Juan Perón precipitously announces that Argentina> has learned to control thermonuclear fusion, citing his secret project at> Huemul under the direction of Nazi physicist Ronald Richter. The suspicions> raised by the international scientific community compel Perón to establish an> investigative commission, which, aided by Richter’s dubious behavior in> pointing out his own project’s scientific deficiencies, force Perón to close> down the project after he calls on help from SS officer and former Farben> corporate executive, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. Richter is openly> ridiculed in the scientific press. During this same time frame, Argentine> intelligence documents place Bormann in the same environs of Bariloche as> Richter’s fusion project.> 6. 1952: The U.S.A. tests the first hydrogen bomb, code-named “Mike”. The> detonation exceeds pre-test calculated yields by almost four megatons,> strongly suggesting another form of energy was being tapped by the device.> 7. 1952: Nasser takes power in Egypt, and imports German experts from the Nazi> International and with the backing of the West German government. These> include Skorzeny, Remer, Schacht, and Voss, i.e., include connections to the> security, financial, and technological aspects of the Nazi Reich. These in> turn train Nasser’s security forces, army, and translate Nazi “classics” into> Arabic.> 8. 1956: The United States Air Force shows a sudden and secret interest in the> work of Dr. Ronald Richter, long after Perón had shut down Richter’s “fusion”> project. Richter’s ideas clearly involve more than fusion, but use fusion to> achieve manipulation of control over what Richter calls “zero point energy.”> 9. 1955-1958: Carlos Miguel Allende writes his letters to Dr. Morris Jessup> concerning the Philadelphia Experiment and Einstein’s (1928) unified field> theory, while the Office of Naval Research and its Project Orbiter Committee> receive copies of Jessup’s UFO book curiously annotated with notes referring> to the experiment, to anti-gravity, and an ancient cosmic war. The Navy has> one of its contractors print up a small run of Jessup’s book with the> annotations, which becomes known as the Varo Edition. This is circulated to> its “top people,” one of whom may very likely have been Wehrner Von Braun.22> 10. ca. 1954-1960: Wehrner Von Braun allegedly visits and corresponds with> German physicist Burkhardt Heim, whose six-dimensional spin-oriented and> fully-quantized theory of space-time was first openly publicized in West> Germany in 1954. Heim’s research at that period was sponsored by the German> arms and aerospace firm, Messerschmitt-Belkow-Blohm.23 Note now a pattern that> has emerged: whenever one encounters an “off-the-books physics” dealing with> rotating systems, rotating plasma, anti-gravity or exotic physics, one finds> Nazis at almost every turn. Von Braun’s interest in Heim’s theory, and in> other processes that cannot be detailed here, is part and parcel of his> interest in anomalies he had encountered during this same time frame.> 11. May 1961: President John F. Kennedy announces the goal of landing a man on> the Moon before the decade is out to a joint session of Congress.> 12. 1962-1963: President Kennedy quietly proposes to Premier Khrushchev that> the United States and the Soviet Union cooperate in reaching the Moon. Shortly> before his assassination, according to Hoagland and Bara, Khrushchev accepts.> 13. Nov. 23, 1963: President Kennedy is assassinated by a conspiracy in Dallas> while on a campaign swing through the state.> 14. 1961-1965: Russian and American space program launch schedules shows signs> of deliberate though covertly organized coordination.24> 15. 1965: American physicist and electrical engineer Philo Farnsworth reports> a sustained fusion reaction of about half a minute in a device no bigger than> a softball. After an initial flurry of press attention, Farnsworth’s corporate> sponsor, I.T.&T., a corporation with known Nazi wartime connections, shuts the> project down.> 16. Dec. 9, 1965: A UFO crashes near Kecksburg, Pennsylvania after a flight> from northwest Canada down over Michigan and Ohio which is observed by several> witnesses. Witnesses on the ground in Pennsylvania report that the U.S.> military and NASA officials arrived within mere hours after the crash,> cordoning off the area and removing the object. The object resembles the Nazi> Bell on a number of crucial data points regarding its dimensions, sound,> shape, and housing.25> 17. 1967: New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison initiates his> investigation of the Kennedy Assassination, and quickly uncovers many Nazi> connections, including Clay Shaw himself, who vetted Paperclip Nazis.> 18. July 20, 1969: Apollo 11 lands on the Moon on the twenty-fifth anniversary> of the unsuccessful assassination and coup attempt on Adolf Hitler’s life. To> my knowledge, not even Mr. Hoagland had mentioned this significant “ritual> alignment” and its implications, though, within the context of his own model> and conclusions, they are clear enough: the very first human landing on the> Moon was on a significant “Nazi holiday,” when the unsuccessful Bomb Plot> against Hitler was foiled in large part by German General Otto Remer. This is> again a clear signal that within the three groups vying for ultimate control> of NASA, it was the Nazis who were most successful in exercising control over> mission planning.> 19. 1970: The “Torbitt Document” alleging the involvement of Wehrner Von Braun> in the Kennedy Assassination first appears.> 20. 1973: The CIA, IT&T, and the Nazi colony “Cologna Dignidad” in Chile> cooperate in the overthrow of Chilean Marxist Salvadore Allende. Cologna> Dignidad subsequently helps train Chilean dictator Pinochet’s intelligence> service.> 21. 1978-19879: Vela satellite detection of a large nuclear-like detonation in> the Indian Ocean prompts President Jimmy Carter’s Administration to accuse> South Africa of having detonated an atom bomb. Subsequent research discloses> that West Germany was the secret technological partner that supplied isotope> separation technologies and German technicians to South Africa and Israel to> use the latter countries as proxies to test its own bomb.26> 22. 1989-1991: German reunification exhibits careful coordination between Bonn> and Neo-Nazi groups in Eastern Europe. Post-reunification Germany moves> quickly and effectively to break up Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, even to the> point of sending German troops to protect Croatia, which, over NATO, UN, and> European opposition, it had unilaterally recognized diplomatically. The significance and importance of this timeline lies not only in the overallpicture and scenario of the postwar survival of the Nazi International and thecomprehensive nature of its activities that it paints, but also in the fact thatone may dispute significant numbers of the individual components of thisscenario, while leaving its overall structure and implications intact. Indeed,while I have argued in this book and elsewhere that Bormann, Müller, and Kammlersurvived the war, the overall scenario itself does not require that they did so.The overall scenario as such only argues that in order for all these variousactivities to have been pursued – especially with evident coordination as in thecase of the Egypt affair, the Richter fusion project affair, Nazi activitiesinside of NASA, or the German reunification itself – that there had to have beenin place a tight-knit organization with very clear and secure channels ofcommunication, chains of command, and financing on both sides of the IronCurtain.This, of course, does not excuse the American side of this story, for clearly,the early formation of the German military-industrial complex that so tragicallydominated the events of the Second World War – and to that extent, the postwarworld – were not only of German, but American, making.Many might be inclined to dismiss the contemporary relevance of this scenarioeven while they may be inclined to grant its plausibility. After all, by nowBormann and Company, if they survived the war as I believe the evidencesuggests, are long dead. Surely their successors would, by now, be rather tiredof “Nazi fun and games” and be more about the serious business of increasingprofits and extending their influence in more benign, legitimate, andrespectable ways. But I am bold to suggest that this is a temptation that mustbe avoided at all costs for one very plain and patent reason: Bormann, Müller,and Kammler themselves, not to mention Schacht, Skorzeny, Voss, Remer, and allthe other parade of wickedness and evil we have surveyed here, were allthemselves bureaucrats. They were, in a word, “professional” Nazis. Nazism as anideology is about but one thing: gain power over as much of the world bywhatever means possible, and hold on to it. It was an ideology that maintainedthere were far too many “useless eaters” of “dubious racial background” in theworld – much like the pronouncements one hears coming from the global corporateelite today – and busily set out to do something about it.What has been surveyed here – and it is only a survey – indicates precisely abold design to exploit conflict in the most subtle ways to promote their agenda,to control and develop advanced energy technologies with a variety ofapplications – field propulsion, “free” energy, and a horrendous weaponizationpotential – and monopolize them for its own group interest, an interest perhapsbest exemplified in their determined effort to conquer the high ground of spaceitself, monopolize and control whatever artifacts and technologies they foundthere, and with them, and from the high ground of space itself, to dominate theearth through a shadowy multi-ethnic international organization of internationalfinance and criminal activity, centered around a solid German core.If, as Mr. Hoagland and Mr. Bara argued, Apollo 10 was delayed simply because“it was not the proper time,” than that puts all of Hoagland’s argumentsconcerning the ritual alignments of Apollo 11 into an even darker conspiratorialcontext.Thus, when Neil Armstrong announced that the Lunar Excursion Module had toucheddown on July 20, 1969, onto the lunar landscape on the twenty-fifth anniversaryof the failed bomb plot against Hitler, he probably never even noticed the highirony of his statement, “the eagle has landed,” for it was someone else’s eagle– one with a swastika surrounded by oak leaves clutched in its talons – that hadfiled the flight plan.1 Peter Levenda, Sinister Forces: A Grimoire of American Political Witchcraft:Book One: The Nine (Trine Day, 2005), p. 134.2 See my The Philosophers’ Stone (Feral House, 2009), chapter 11.3 Ibid.4 See my Secrets of the Unified Field, pp. 1-155 See my Reich of the Black Sun (Adventures Unlimited Press, 2004), pp. 172-180.6 See my The SS Brotherhood of the Bell (Adventures Unlimited Press, 2006), pp.148-151.7 See my Secrets of the Unified Field, pp. 1-17.8 See my The Philosophers’ Stone (Feral House, 2009), chapter 11.9 Various books have been published about this expedition, most of themmentioning the copy of the Kang Shuur.

Needlessto say, there is much more going on here than even Mr. Hoagland alludes to inhis paper, a story which we both hope to collaborate on in the future intelling. Mr. Hoagland has been gracious enough to share some of his research andthe scientific papers it is based upon with me. Suffice it to say, he is thebest one to tell this aspect of the story, and we both hope to pool ourresources in the future to do so.24 See my SS Brotherhood of the Bell, pp. 120-123.25 See my Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 331-344.26 See my Reich of the Black Sun, pp 268-9; and SS Brotherhood of the Bell, pp.240-1, n.76."},{"pageContent":"image [images/00065.jpg] > Agoston, Tom.
