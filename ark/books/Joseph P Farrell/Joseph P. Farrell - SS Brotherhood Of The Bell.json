I would also like to thank him for first breaking the story of the Bell, which may be the most important story of suppressed science and technology in the 20 th century.

Kennedy, and my perplexity with the subsequent findings of the Warren Commission and its \"lone nut magic bullet\" theory. I then proceeded to mention another curious anomaly of the history I had learned in school, namely, the fact that the U.S. military had not tested the uranium \"shot-gun\" atom bomb it had dropped on Hiroshima. The mention of those two odd events in that Preface was not accidental nor merely a whim, for the two events are not unrelated. Indeed, they are not even loosely unrelated, as there are direct threads - and in some cases whole cables - connecting both. I am not the first author to draw attention to the pervasive Nazi connections lurking in the background of the JFK assassination, nor, I imagine, will [ be the last. The well-known conspiracy theorist and JFK assassination researcher Mae Brussell was perhaps the first major \"alternative researcher\" to speak out about this aspect of the assassination. Others followed in her wake, adding a detail here or a story there, but it was Brussell who first courageously unearthed the most sensational details. Notwithstanding her ability to ferret out the detailed connections of conspiracy, however, even she managed to miss perhaps the most important lynch-pin connecting Nazis, the Roswell episode, and one possible motivation for the JFK assassination: Nazi technology. However, to the average reader, even one predisposed to believe in some sort of conspiracy involved with the cold-blooded murder of President Kennedy, the idea that there is a Nazi connection must seem to stretch credulity. Even Brussell urged that to draw such connections would have been beyond the wildest yarn of Robert Ludlum, popular and well-known writer of espionage thrillers throughout the I970s and 1980s. But to maintain a connection between all that and to Roswell, the establishment of the MAJIC-12 group, and indeed, the establishment of the whole \"national security\" intelligence apparatus of the U.S. government, XI"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Preface would seem to stretch credulity to the snapping point. But that, indeed, is what [ believe in part to be the case. And that case is what this book is, in part, about. But here, as in Reich of the Black Sun, the focus is not only on the implications of Nazi survival and the possibility that its secret weapons projects were continued independently of any of the governments of the post-war world. We shall also continue the detailed comparison of the wartime development of exotic physics and technologies by the Nazis, with the technologies of \"recovered craft\" outlined in the MAJIC-12 documents that was begun in Reich of the Black Sun, for new documentary evidence has come to my attention since its publication, and this in tum compels further investigation, an investigation that was begun in chapters 16 and 17 of the previous book. As will be seen in the main body of this work, these documents almost nowhere evidence the type of contradictory data-sets encountered in the MAJIC-12 documents examined in Reich of the Black Sun, but rather, speak more directly to a terrestrial, though unknown, origin for the recovered craft. And in at least one instance, a MAJIC-12 document clearly points the finger to Nazi Germany, and even casts an aura of suspicion on the all-too-convenient death of General Patton. When these details are compared with the known developments of Nazi secret weapons research, the picture is quite disturbing. Even more disturbing is why such documents and their terrestrial origin implications continue to be ignored by the North American UFOlogy community. As such, this book is, like the previous one, a book about the exotic weapons the Nazis were developing, but unlike the previous one, it is more about the underlying, and quite monstrous, physics they were developing as a basis for these weapons. Likewise, this book is also about the implications of that physics and those weapons for recent politics and histOlY. As we shall see, this physics has strong ties with the \"scalar\" non-linear \"electro- acoustic\" waves and thinking developed first by Tesla, and subsequently elaborated by Nazi and Soviet physicists, and also to the type of physics I have posited was the basis underlying my three books on the Great Pyramid and the weapon hypothesis, The Giza Death Star, The Giza Death Star Deployed. and The Giza XII"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Ti,e 55 Brotlrer/rood of tire Bell Death Star Des/royed. The scientists and mathematicians in Nazi Germany that began the groundbreaking and revolutionary work in this type of physics were in the uttermost lofty reaches of the classification system of the SS. The group of scientists and engineers investigating this monstrous new physics and its implied technologies were an elite band, a \"brotherhood\" within the black brotherhood of the SS that [ call simply \"the SS Brotherhood of the Bell.\" Their credo, forced on some by the Nazi ideology and readily embraced by others, was the development of a whole new paradigm of physics, free of the constraints of relativity and \"Jewish physics.\" And develop it they did. It is therefore in the complex interface of history and technology that this book, like the previous one, lives. Therefore some may contrive to dismiss this work as even more speculative than its predecessor. In this respect, while always believing the Kennedy assassination to have been the work of a conspiracy, [ myself came to entertain a possible Nazi involvement rather late, preferring, like most, to see a network of \"coalescing interests\" comprising the Mafia, disenchanted CIA and possibly FBI elements, and high-level business and banking interests as being behind it, united for a brief moment, to achieve a common and horrible goal. Certainly such elements, particularly in the murky connection between government and \"big business\" and, most importantly, \"banking,\" would have the necessary clout and influence to maintain a cover-up down to our day. But the motivation for such an ongoing cover-up remains unclear. Until one adds in Nazis and advanced technology that, in its benign aspect, promises an end to current energy technologies and the geopolitical order that tbey impose and threatens the complete upheaval of the global economic \"order\", and that, in its malevolent aspect, is black with the dark promise of truly planet- busting weapons utterly beyond the wildest thermonuclear fantasies of an Edward Teller or Andrei Sakharov. Add to this mix elements within the federal government running on the fumes of fear and in thrall to globalist corporate oligarchies intent on public suppression and secret development of alternative physics and energy systems, and one has a coalescence of interests that would have strong motivations for murdering a President who gave XIII"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Preface repeated signals that he was prepared to dismantle all of it, or at least bring significant parts of it out into the open. Some may therefore dismiss this work as an exercise in paranoia, and perhaps it is. But given the history of governments in modern times, one can never be too paranoid. Afier all, they are. And as a lesson of paranoia with global ambitions, the Nazi regime ofthe Third Reich is without peer. It takes genuine crazed paranoia to lead a nation the size of the state of Texas to conquer Europe and wage war with most of the rest of the world for six years, and then to plan, in the midst of it all and with customary German thoroughness and organization, for a continuance of Nazism after the war. But it took likewise a paranoia without peer to dream of a physics with so much flexibility, not only with a potential planet- busting capability but also with an endless promise in the fields of energy and propulsion, and then to proceed to begin the theoretical and experimental spade work to bring that physics to practical and realizable weapons and propulsion systems. As this book avers, by the time of the German surrender, they had made sufficient progress in their work that it was continued by them after the war in a number of \"host\" countries, including the Soviet Union, South Africa, Japan, Brazil, and, yes, (West) Germany. But there are other reasons that have made this sequel necessary. The first of these was my acquisition of some of the wartime papers of physicists mentioned in Reich of the Black Sun. Acquisition of these papers has caused me to correct certain inaccuracies in the previous book and has raised new questions. Secondly, the excellent series on Hitler's \"victory weapons,\" German author Friedrich Georg's Hitlers SiegeswaJJen series, has continued with the recent appearance, just last year, of his research into German long-range rocketry, guidance systems, and nascent space program. This research, placed in the wider context of SS projects in radical physics, raises new questions about the \"Allied Legend\" that were first raised in Reich of the Black Sun. Georg's research, as we shall see, also raises important questions not only regarding what was going on at Peenernunde in the final weeks of the war, but also important questions directly calling into question Lt. Col. Corso's account of the Roswell affair in his famous book The Day After Roswell. XIV"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell Equally important, Polish military researcher Igor Witkowski's superb research into all aspects of German secret weapons has finally been published in a single volume in English entitled The Truth About the WunderwaJJe. Needless to say, the material in Witkowski's book on the SS's most secret project, The Bell, greatly expands the amount of information available in English. The emergence of Witkowski's research in English would, in and of itself, require a sequel to Reich of the Black Sun. I therefore rely heavily on Witkowski's magisterial research in this work. Witkowski's research likewise also raises serious questions and doubts about Col. Corso's assertion that \"ET\" technology was gradually seeded into American industry after the Roswell incident. And of course, Witkowski's research forms the essential joundation for any examination of the Bell and the exotic physics it may represent. As will be apparent in the main body of this work, however, I have cast the Bell and the physics it may represent in a very different interpretive and admittedly much more radical and speculative a context than does Witkowski. It seems to me that this was necessary both because of the type of signature eJJects it seemed to have, but also because of the indications tbat the Germans were investigating a type of physics called by various names, but which, following the suggestion of Tom Bearden's research into this subject, I have called \"scalar\" physics. Such physics represents not only a new and efficient energy source, but also perhaps the ultimate power for destruction. Therefore, its continued and perhaps independent development by various criminal conspiracies and syndicates may indeed have been one of the penultimate factors and motivations in the assassination of President John F Kennedy. Finally, Carter Plymton Hydrick's excellent research has finally been published in book fom1, Critical Mass: How Nazi Germany Surrendered Enriched Uranium for the United States' Atomic Bomb. Since there are slight revisions in this work from the internet version I first relied on in Reich of the Black Sun, revisions that themselves compel new speculations - many from Hydrick himself - it seemed appropriate that this work was the best place to address some of these issues. [n any case, Hydrick's work remains xv"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Preface a standard in this alternative history of World War Two secret weapons that, like Witkowski's or Meyer and Mehner's research, simply cannot and must not be ignored by the serious inquirer into this suppressed and hidden history and science. Finally, a word must be said about my own personal attitude towards and \"philosophy\" of UFOs, lest the contents of this book be taken to represent it in 1010. First, I wish to make it abundantly clear that l am not philosophically opposed to the idea of extra- terrestrial life, nor, for that matter, to the idea of life-forms that inhabit \"higher dimensions\" or \"planes of existence.\" That being said, I am similarly not opposed to the idea that such life forms may have visited, and may be visiting, the Earth. However, I am convinced, by a reading of various \"contactee\" and \"abduction\" reports, that much of this phenomenon is of a profoundly spiritual, and - dare 1 say it - evi I nature. With these broad remarks in mind, then what of actual UFOs? That is, what do 1 make of those reports that clearly indicate actual advanced \"craft .. themselves? While I am also convinced that there are many genuine reports, and even some even more stunning NASA space shuttle footage, by the same token, in but few cases do I personally detect a physics and performance signature that compels to any \"extra-terrestrial\", that is to say, extra-solar system origin for the phenomenon. I do not deny the extreme performance characteristics, only that in mosl cases the characteristics reported still fall short of anything practical for interstellar travel. Moreover, I fully realize that to connect some of the phenomena and documentary evidence to Nazis is a decidedly unpopular view in the UFOlogy community, over-populated as it is by any number of well-known names that push the ET hypothesis no matter what, and even when they should know better. They produce their documents, and argue quite persuasively for their authenticity, and then go on to argue on the basis of their contents that the ET hypothesis is the most plausible explanation for the \"government UFO cover-up.\" And [ do not deny the strength nor the cogency of their arguments. However, as I shall show, there are olher documents that argue against that hypothesis, equally persuasively, that will never be mentioned by those well-known names at their XVI"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell conferences, for they clearly imply a \"Nazi angle\" to the story, even if\"ET\" is left in the picture. By the same token, my use of the \"Nazi Legend\" to reinterpret the MAJlC-12 story and Colonel Corso's The Day After Roswell may be misunderstood as well. Accordingly, I do not believe the \" azi Legend\" explains all UFO sightings for the simple reason that there are far too many of them for this source to be the origin of all of them. It explains only a limited number of cases, during a limited time frame in selected locations.

Patton wrote a remarkable thing in his war diary: \"We can still lose this war.\" It was a remarkable statement, especially since the last large German offensive of World War Two, the Battle of the Bulge, was all but finished, and the victorious Allied armies, like their Soviet counterparts in the East, were then poised to deal the final death blows to Hitler's crumbling Third Reich. Optimism prevailed at the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). For some reason, however, General \"Blood and Guts\" Patton, despite his well known public image of bravado and optimism, had serious private fears and reservations. The question is: Why? Why indeed, since on any conventional military appraisal, the German Reich was finished. It was only a matter of. .. time. But even with the ill-fated German Ardennes offensive - the Battle of the Bulge - there is more than meets the eye when one adds in the thesis of my previous book, Reich of the Black Sun, that the Nazis may have won the race for the atom bomb well ahead of the Manhattan Project. The objective of the German offensive was, according to the standard explanation, to break through thinly held American lines in the Ardennes, drive behind the Allied lines in I Linda Hunt, The United States Government.

But the standard explanation fails simply for the reason that the Allies would have been capable of using Dutch ports to supply the \"trapped\" armies. Thus, the end of the war presents, behind the \"obvious\" and \"well known 'facts,'\" yet another mystery. What really was the Nazi leadership trying to do, and why would it have caused such concern to General Patton to cause him to remark about it in his diary? British author Geoffrey Brooks pinpoints the hidden military and political reasoning that lay behind the Nazi offensive by raising precisely this question: Hitler's Luftwaffe ADC von Below remarked in bis 1982 memoirs tbat even he could not understand why Hitler wanted to go to Antwerp - \"a place that led nowhere.'\" But the answer may lie in a curious order placed in German shipyards in the period leading up to the surprise German offensive, for an order for twenty-four \"500-ton submersible barges able to transport and launch V-2 rockets\" was placed at yards in Stettin and Elbing. 4 And London was just within range of the V-2 from Antwerp. But the mystery does not yet end, for an offensive merely to resume the V-2 bombardment of England does not yet make sense. According to Brooks, one only begins to see the logic behind the German offensive by seeing it connected to a resumption of V-2 attacks, for \"the V-2 campaign had been a failure. Hitler knew that. There had to be something extra to make all this worthwhile.',5 What that \"something extra\" was, was hinted at by none other than the Deputy Commanding General for the US Army Air Force's Intelligence, Lieutenant General Donal Putt, shortly after the war in 1946. Brooks' comments are worth citing extensively: 'Geoffrey Brooks, Hiller's Terror Weapolls: From VI/a Vim alia (Pen and Sword Books: Barnsley, South Korshire, 2002), p. 103. (ISBN 0850528968) , Ibid. , Ibid. 2"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of tI,e Bell (Lt. General Putt) told the Society of Aeronautical Engineers: \"The Germans were preparing rocket surprises for the whole world in general and England in particular which would have, it is believed, changed the course of the war if the invasion had been postponed for so shon a lime as half a year.\" Putt was also quoted in an aside as having stated that '·the Gennans had V-2s with atomic explosive warheads.\" A surprise is a surprise and hitherto ordinary rocket warfare had proved unproductive. The range of the V-2 was 200 miles. The crucial success of the Allied progress by December 1944 had tberefore been to drive the German forces in Europe beyond this limit. The objective of the Ardennes campaign was the Belgian port of Antwerp, 200 miles from London' In other words, once again, the Nazi atom bomb is the hidden logic at work in the operational plans of both sides late in the war, and is very likely the hidden operational logic behind the otherwise militarily indefensible German offensive in the Ardennes. Small wonder then, that Patton would remark \"We can still lose this war,\" even at such a late date. Similarly, if this scenario is the basis of his remarks, then it also serves to indicate that America's most celebrated field commander was also privy to some very sensitive infonnation. As was seen in my previous book, Reich of the Black SUIl, a number of articles appeared in the post-war Western press to corroborate the notion that the war was won, not against a tottering Reich, but just in the nick of time. The articles usually accompanied these evaluations with revelations of Nazi secret weapons, most of them on the \"fantastic\" end of the spectrum. Perhaps this was a ploy to convince the Western public that the Nazi leaders were quite insane - as if any convincing needed to be done by that point - and that their hopes were so wildly bizarre and unrealistic that indeed the Third Reich's military state in late J 944 and early 1945 was all but hopeless.

You will recollect that the SHAEF forecast, arrived at after D- day in 1944, placed the capitulation of Germany at the end of December of that year. It is believed that this SHAEF forecast strongly influenced Ibe planning in Washington and in this theater. Predicated upon this date, questions of rype U.S. Air Force equipment, weapons, tactics, training and supplies were decided. 2. Hitler's Gennany did not place the tennination date of tbis war at the end of 1944. Hitler's Germany has indicated with detennination and virility that it expects this war to continue for a long and indefinite period of time, and that it is struggling to gain supremacy in weapons as well as generalship. 3. With the exception of a few modifications and improvements in tbe U.S. Air Forces in this theater are fighting with substantially tbe same weapons as they used in 1942. From 1942 tbrough 1944 tbe aircraft and equipment of the U.S. Anny Air Forces were superior in practically every detail to anything the enemy had in this theater. Indeed, weapons and equipment in general, wbether belonging to the Ground Troops or to the Air, enjoyed for the U.S. superiority during this first period. This period ended December 31, 1944 with Germany still fighting, but Germany is not fighting with the weapons of 1942. She is leading the world in tested jet propelled airplanes, long range missiles, new type submarines and, in certain classes, better tanks. A large part of her manufacturing facilities have gone underground and she is bending every sinew for the last stand on the Vaterland frontiers. 4. Our Ground Armies, despite superiority in manpower and quantity of equipment, are presently engaged more in defensive than offensive fighting and, unless this slate of affairs is quickly changed or the Russians actually drive through to Berlin and victory, we must face the grim expectation of fighting Germany and her new capabilities through greater 1945. 8"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell 5.

Indeed, as the document indicates, that very numerical superiority was threatened with immanent obsolescence, if not being totally obsolete, in 1945. Germany, which had invented modern combined-arms maneuver warfare as a means of offsetting her potential opponents' numerical superiority, was about to change the nature of warfare yet again, and catch the Allies flatfooted, unprepared, and off balance.

There were approximately 225,000 volumes, which included secret jiles.( .. .) Eventually, the files were evacuated and studied.( ... )'6 This is a crucial revelation, for it brings us back to the context of the Kammlerstab SS secret weapons \"think tank\" for the simple reason that all patents in the Third Reich were secretly scrutinized by a highly classified SS entity called Forschung, Entwicklung, Palenle, which answered to an SS Obergruppen-fiihrer Emil Mazuw, about whom more will be said in chapter four. Project Lusty's revelation accordingly prompts a very serious question: did the American intelligence teams simply \"blindly stumble onto\" this treasure trove? Or were they led there? The last possibility seems more likely, as it is known that Kammler returned to Prague and the Skoda Works at Pilsen - headquarters of his \"think tank\" - in the last days of the war. As Nick Cook hypothesizes, Kammler did so to put the finishing touches on gatherin¥ up all his files and gathering them together to barter for his life. J Thus, if the Americans knew where to look, this information could only have come to them from some source inside the Kammlerslab. It is well known that SS General Wolff undertook secret surrender negotiations with OSS station chief in Zurich, Allen Dulles, in the closing days of the war.

Among those events one must highlight the following: (I) U.S. General Patton's rapid drive across southern Germany toward the Skoda Works at Pilsen in Czechoslovakia and similar Allied thrusts toward the Harz Mountain SS installations in Thuringia; (2) The secret negotiations between ass station chief Allen Dulles l9 and SS General Wolff; (3) The disappearance ofSS General Hans Kammler; (4) The disappearance of Kammler's most highly classified research project, \"the Bell,\" along with all its project documentation; and finally, (5) The ironic - and some would say extremely suspicious - death of General George Patton shortly after the war's end. A speculative pattern emerges, for if Wolff was secretly negotiating with Dulles with the tacit approval of Bormann - and Bormann's approval meant Hitler's as well - then it is likely that the collateral was the treasure trove of the Kammlerstab's documents, which would have included the secret patents of the Third Reich, seized and classified by the Forschung, Entwicklung, und Patente. The unerring precision with which late war American thrusts - largely by Patton's Third Army - toward the most secret centers and installations of Kammler's black projects empire were guided can only indicate that at some very high level the Americans were receiving \"inside information\" that came from an equally high level within the Third Reich: Kammler and Bormann.

In either case, he would have been in a position to disclose a vast and hidden intelligence operation, not the least of which included a Faustian bargain for exotic technology and post-war cooperation between the azis and the western Allies, particularly with the United States. And what of the treasure trove itself? A glance at more unusual German secret weapons will demonstrate why General Patlon in early 1945 - perhaps already \"in the loop\" on the secret negotiations taking place, and the \"technological potential\" the Allies faced if those negotiations were not successful - expressed serious private reservations about the Allies \"still being able to lose this war.\" 2. Death Beneath the Seas: The Extraordinary Capabilities of the Type XXI U-boat While Project Lusty concerned itself exclusively with Nazi aero-space technology, it is worth mentioning one of the deadliest potentials that was already coming into production as the war approached its end: the very new, and very lethal, German Type XXI U-boat. The Type XXI thus represented no mere prototype waiting to see production; it was not mere potential. It was a very real and present danger that would have presented the Allies with no end of difficulties at sea had the war continued even just a few weeks longer. And as I averred in Reich of the Black Sun, it is likely that the British had the misfortune of encountering a few Type XXls before the end of hostilities 20 The Type XXls possessed a novel propulsion system, the Walther turbine utilizing hydrogen peroxide, that allowed a speed of some 17.2 knots submerged, and according to the first trials information of the Kriegsmarine, were capable of a truly \" Joseph P.

With its special \"radar absorbent material\" coating its newer streamlined schnorkel device, and its tremendous maximum possible submerged depth, the submarine managed to be undetectable to American surface vessels at a mere 200 meters away when the U.S. Navy conducted tests on one specimen in I 946!24 As Polish researcher Igor Witkowski puts it, the submarine \"was ajump from the level of the 1940s into the 1960s.,,25 But even this recitation does not even begin to exhaust its truly deadly potential in naval warfare. If an Allied aircraft somehow managed to elude its on board radar and four 20 millimeter turreted anti-aircraft guns on either side of the boat's streamlined conning tower, the submarine could be completely under water in a mere 18 seconds 26 But that is not all, for unlike any other submarine in any other navy, the Type XXI's captain would not even have to see his target to fire torpedos at it: The submarine possessed a completely revolutionary system of torpedo fire control, enabling it to carry out effective attacks even at complete submersion, the target positions being determined by creating lhree- dimensional co-ordinates of the noise '5 source through recalculating of delays received by various microphones placed on the submarine's hull.

After all, a Type XXI with conventional torpedos was bad enough ... 3. Death in the Air: The Sound Barrier Too? The Project Lusty documentation referred to previously indicates that the Type XXI's deadly performance characteristics were matched, if not surpassed, by similar German developments in aerial warfare. With the Allied and Soviet Air Forces' increasing dominance of the skies over Germany, it became increasingly vital for the Luftwaffe to pursue the unconventional avenue toward recovering mastery of the air over Germany. One such solution, the Focke Wulfe Triebfliigel, is well-known to researchers. This \"vertical take-off and landing\" or VTOL fighter was a viable solution, since there was no need to try to take off or land on bombed and cratered airfield runways. Consisting of three rotating wings around a central fuselage, each wing was tipped with a ramjet engine. The wings could in tum be rotated to increase or decrease the angle of attack. With rockets to assist the ramjets to get started, the Triebfltlgel was in effect a vertical take-off and landing jet-airplane combined with a helicopter. Witkowski describes it as follows: (The) name could be translated as \"propulsive wing\", reflecting its unusual principle of operation. During take-off and landing the lifting surfaces performed the function of a helicopter's rotor, whereas during flight at high speed they \"transformed\" into wings .... Three ramjet engines were mounted on the wing tips. each with a max.imum thrust of 840 KG. During take-off they were boosted by three Walter rocket engines, accelerating the wings to a speed enabling the ramjet engines to be started. 21': \" Witkoski.

The rotor operated at 520 rpm, which after conversion gave a rotational speed of the tips of 1,500 kmIh. The initial rate of climb amounted to 7.5 km/min. Rotor working time -42 min., range 640 km. AI all altitude of I I km horizolltal speed amoull/ed to 800 km/h. 19 Note that the speed of the craft at normal altitudes was 1,000 kilometers per hour, or approximately 600 miles per hour. Note also that the craft was apparently capable of reaching altitudes of some II kilometers, or about six and a half miles above the surface, far above the normal operational altitudes of most Allied and Soviet aircraft of the war. The performance characteristics cited are made even more remarkable by the fact that the Triebjlilgel and similar craft were apparently brought to the United States as part of Project Lusty: A report reached Lt Col. O'Brien's party that a \"strange aircraft\" had been seen in a mountainous retreat near Salzburg. Lnvestigation quickly determined that this \"strange aircraft: was a jet-propelled helicopter, the only one of its kind in the world. The invemor and his entire staff, who had laboriously worked ten years to perfect it, were present, guarding his invention as one would a precious jewel. The helicopter was examined, and a preliminary superficial interrogation of the staff was sufficient to reveal its tremendous importance. h was carefully loaded in a large truck and taken to Munich. From there it was sent across Europe to France, placed on a boat and shipped to Wright Field, 29 fbid., p. 205, citing W.

But now a question occurs: if the machine - and there was only one such of its kind in the world - was brought to Wright Patterson Airfield JI and its scientists interred and papers confiscated, how did the post-war Polish Communist government know so much about its performance within six years of the war's end? The standard answer is, of course, that there were Soviet spies within the program, and that is the most likely explanation. But there is another possible answer that will loom ever larger as we proceed, and that is that it is possible that all these programs were continued after the war in a variety of host countries including Russia, and yet were independently coordinated from some hidden center, passing information back and forth between the cells in various host countries via a continuing \"Nazi International\". The Triebjliigel also points to another direction wartime German research pursued, and pursued with a vengeance: high performance ramjet-propelled aircraft. Indeed, when entering this area of inquiry, one is again entering one of those areas where the reality of wartime German accomplishments in secret weapons research was in diametric contradiction to the post-war Allied Legend, only in this case, the legend is not about the Allies having acquired the a-bomb while the Nazis remained incompetent nuclear bunglers, but about the fact that an American, Chuck Yeager, was the first human to pilot an aircraft through the sound barrier, an event that occurred after the war's end and the beginning of America's own black projects in exotic aircraft and space-based weapons.

Death on the Ground: Weapons of Mass Destruction in Use by the German Army on the Eastern Front in 1941 Beyond these deadly aerial and submarine developments of the late war, there were already indicators that something had long been afoot on the ground as well, as persistent rumors came from the Eastern Front that the German Army, on more than one occasion, had used some weapon of enormous destructive power on Russian military targets. In Reich of the Black Sun I indicated that this was most likely some early version of a fuel-air bomb, a device that the Germans had brought, by the end of the war, to enormous capability.41 The sources for these strange allegations were none other than a secret Japanese communique from its embassy in Stockholm, Sweden, to an equally secret communication from the Soviets to the Nazis that if they did not \"cease and desist\" the Russians would resort to the use of poison gas. Further corroboration of this is found in none other than celebrated SS commando Otto Skorzeny's memoirs. However, he recounts that their first use occurred not in the siege of Sevastopo] in the Crimea in 1942, nor indeed with the prologue to the Battle of Kursk in 1943, but in the fierce Battle for Moscow during late November and early December of 1941 !

These were similar to enormous bombs and as far as my competence allows me to estimate - their effectiveness had no equal. Their use immediately had an impact on the enemy's defensive forces. The enemy used huge loudspeakers for propaganda purposes ... By means of them several days after first using our missiles the Russians threatened to respond with gas attacks if we continued to use rockets filled with liquid air. From that moment, at. 41 Q.v.

The six barrels of a typical Nebelwerfer were arranged in a hexagonal pattern on an otherwise conventional split-trail artillery carriage. The 280mm Nebelwerfer units would have been the ideal delivery system for fuel air bombs. 44 One can only guess what the effect of a battery of these weapons firing fuel air bombs on rockets, with their sirens screaming down on their targets, all synchronized to detonate simultaneously, would have had on a Russian unit. The phrase \"carpet bombing\" together with \"tactical nukes\" might, however, come close. But in any case, it is clear why the Russians resorted to the threat of poison gas. And perhaps it is also clear why only recently the Russian government has revealed that its casualties during the war were far higher than anyone had previously imagined. Operationally competent as the German Army was during World War Two, the fantastic \"kill ratios\" it achieved on the Eastern Front could only have been due to the assistance of unconventional weaponry, and weaponry of mass destruction at that. 5. Beyond the Nuclear and Thermonuclear Bombs: Indications of a New Physics Project Lusty also corroborates another sensational allegation that we shall encounter much later, namely, that the Nazis were engaged in research on various types of \"death rays\" or \"anti- aircraft rays.\" This research apparently was undertaken in Vienna at number 87 Weimarsrrasse. 4 But these were no ordinary lasers. According to Polish researcher Igor Witkowski, the German government's archives indicate that In 1944 a special Luftwaffe research establishment received the task to develop such a weapon, situated in the town of Gross Ostheim. Materials relating to this work are currently located in a civilian 44 These bombs would not have been of the same colossal size as I reported on pp. 191-192 of Reich of the Black Sun, since the range of these rocket launchers was relatively short. \" Witkowski, The Tnlth A bOll/ the Wlllulenvaffe, p. 227. 27"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"1n Ille Nick a/Time establishment - the Karlsruhe research centre (Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe) and were disclosed several years ago.'\" As was seen in Reich of the Black Sun, research was also conducted into exotic \"Tesla\" technology at the University of Heidelberg, where an underground bunker was discovered tbat housed a large artificial quartz parabolic dish which was used to fire hj~h voltage pulses at targets some meters away to disintegrate them 4 In this ligbt it is perhaps worth mentioning that the giant German electronics firm, Siemens A.G., took out one of the first patents for an X-ray laser in the U.S.A. in 1955,48 roughly half a decade before the first masers and lasers were \"discovered.\" Did the Siemens patent in fact reflect work already undertaken by the Third Reicb? While this cannot be detertnined with certainty, it is perhaps significant that tbe Siemens firm seldom reveals the exact nature and extent of its research undertaken during the Nazi era. And it is perhaps also significant that Siemens might be trying to protecl a patent or device previously filed during tbe Nazi era and subsequently confiscated as booty by taking out a patent for an X- ray laser in tbe United States. Taken together, all these secret weapons projects - and they are only the tip of a very large, very deadly iceberg - indicate that Nazi Germany was aiming for supremacy on the ground, sea, and air.

However, this step may seem an odd place to begin a book whose principal subjects are not rockets and atom bombs, but (I) even more destmctive and fantastic weapons and the technologies and science tbey imply, (2) their continued and possibly independent development, and (3) the possible implications of that development in the most famous political assassination in modem history, the cold-blooded murder of President John F.

On the basis of his principles and accomplishments, Soviet Russia maintained an early lead over America, racking up the following impressive list of \"firsts\": (I) It was the first to launch and orbit an artificial satellite, the famous Sputnik; (2) It was the first to launch an animal - the little dog Laika - into space; (3) It was the first to orbit and successfully return a man into space, Colonel Yuri Gagarin; (4) It was the first to orbit and successfully return a woman into space; (5) It was the first to land unmanned probes successfully on the Moon; (6) It was the first to conduct successfully \"extra-vehicular activity,\" i.e., a space walk, by humans in orbit; and last but not least, (7) It was the first to place nuclear and thermonuclear warheads on an ICBM, the SS-6 and SS-7 \"Sapwood.\" Then, suddenly and quite inexplicably, the Soviet Union seemed to have \"lost its drive\" when the Apollo 8 mission successfully orbited, and the Apollo II mission successfully landed, humans on the Moon and returned them safely to the Earth. Inexplicably, the Soviet Union seemed to \"just give up\" and, as far as we know, never launched its own manned Moon mission, even though it was well within Russian capabilities. And perhaps equally inexplicably, the U.S.A., sighting \"budget cuts\" and public disinterest, discontinued its own Moon program, abandoning the scheduled Apollo 18 through 21 missions, and breaking up its remaining 32"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Tile 55 Brotherhood of tile Bell Saturn V boosters. The U.S.A. would not return to the Moon until the 1990s, with the Pentagon's unmanned \"Clementine\" orbiter. Then suddenly China orbited a human, and declared its intention to go to the Moon. Suddenly American interest seemed to change again, and the Bush Administration decided it would be a good idea for America to go back while on our ultimate way to Mars. From World War Two to the present, space represents a strange cast of characters and a strange plot indeed: Hitler, the Soviets led by Korolev and his team of German engineers, the Americans and their team of German engineers, the French- dominated European space agency and their team of German engineers, the Japanese, the Indians, and now the Chinese. China is significant for it underscores the actual Soviet achievement, for China's space technology is but re-worked Soviet technology updated with the latest American .. 1. Boosler alld Lift Capabilities All this implies that the Soviet Union developed very early on boosters with enormous thrust and lift capabilities, as the following comparative chart of American and Russian rockets from the 1950s and 1960s illustrates: 1 I \" , t 1 2 T I ~ T / I , 4 ~ ~ 'J I , , .f.. ~ ..

Of course this is in part explained by the fact that the Russians had to develop rockets with greater thrust than America for two important reasons. First, they were less successful in miniaturizing components than the Americans, and consequently, pound for functional pound, their rockets tended to be heavier. But there is a much more important and obvious reason. Given its relatively more northern latitude, the Russians could not take advantage of the greater angular velocity of the earth as could the Americans, situated as they were at more southern latitudes. At the latitude of Cape Canaveral, the angular velocity of the earth is greater than at the Soviet Baikonur Kosmodrome, and hence, American rockets were not required to generate as much thrust to lift similar payloads. 34"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of tire Bell But all this really only serves to underscore the Russian achievement all the more.

What's Wrong with This Picture? Clearly, something is wrong with this picture. The U.S.A. did get the best and brightest of Nazi rocket scientists and technology, yet, the Russians made away with scores of \"middle\" echelon scientists and engineers. How then did Korolev hit upon the brilliant and simple expedient of the \"bundle\" rocket? The standard explanation is that Korolev while on a walk in the woods around his dacha in Moscow was inspired by the root systems of enormous trees. They suggested to him the distinctive shape and concept of the Soviet \"bundle rocket\" boosters 7 In the light of the now known state of German wartime rocketry, however, this cannot be anything other than an attempt to deflect attention away from the real origin of the concept, for as a simple expedient to achieve quick heavy lift capability, it is a characteristic more of a nation at war - and in a hurry - straining to achieve a swift entry to space and long-range rocket bombardment capabilities. [t is an expedient that - like the Nazi decision to pursue only a uranium-fueled atom bomb - fits the practical requirements of Nazi Germany. D. The Real Origin of the Bundle Rocket: \"Projekt Zossen\" Not surprisingly, then, the real origin of the \"bundle rocket\" booster concept was in wartime Nazi Germany, where the idea was bom - in 1942! - to \"bundle together\" five V -2 rocket engines, and fire them simultaneously, to achieve greater lift and range capability. The plan was called \"Project Zossen,\" a clue, perhaps, that the origin of the idea came from within the OKW's super secret underground communications and command bunker in 7 David Percy and Mary Bennett note in Dark Moon, p. 192 t that the names chosen for America's rockets might reflect a hidden occult agenda: \" It is our contention that the coden ames given to projects by the Americans reveal through \\vord association (either intentionally or unintentionally) much about their function. The names of the rockets designed by (Werner Von Braun) at this times were the Redstone and Jupiter.

And clearly Korolev's boosters are but a streamlined second generation version of the earlier Nazi prototype. But was a full scale version of the rocket, or for that matter, any of the other intercontinental rocket designs the Nazis had proposed, ever tested? To answer that question, we return to Peenemiinde, at the end of the war, and notice yet another \"problem.\" E. SS Obergruppenfiihrer Hans Kammlers \"Evacuation\" of Peenemiinde and the Russian Arrival Is there any indication that these early German ICBM \"bundle rockets\" or any other long-range strategic rockets went to actual construction and testing? If so, then the logical choice was Peenemiinde, for in spite of the heavy attention of Allied bombers, it was the only place presumably with facilities large enough to achieve the task. I. Strange Events at an \"Empty\" Site General Walter Dornberger made it clear that as early as 1939 the ultimate goal of the Peenemiinde center was to create a long range rocket capable of striking New York City and other targets on the east coast of the United States. Of course, this implies a capability to strike all of European Russia as wel1. 8 By July 29, 1940, at Peenemiinde the engineer Graupe had already produced the first designs for a trans-Atlantic 2 stage rocket. Hermann Oberth began his own formal studies for the fuel and lift requirements for such a rocket in October of 1941,9 as the Wehrmacht continued to liquidate the Red Army in Operation Barbarossa.

IO Moreover, there exist estimates for cost, labor, and material for the \"America Rocket\" that strongly suggest that it had become more than a mere \"paper project.\" As with anything else in Kammler's black empire of black projects, anything suggesting \"labor\" meant the slave labor of concentration camps, and to suggest that the project was merely a \"paper project\" is to diminish the human suffering that was involved in its very real flesh and blood actualization. Another factor must be weighed. As indicated in my previous book on German secret weapons, The Reich of the Black Sun, there is a circumstantial case that the Nazis successfully tested an atom bomb ca. Oct. 10 th , 1944, on the island of Riigen, or possibly some other island, standing along the German Baltic coast in the sea lanes running from Konigsburg to Klel. 11 This would imply that some time earlier in the summer of that year, the 55 achieved some sort of breakthrough in its bomb program, perhaps finally acquiring enough critical mass to test in a bomb. In any case, the alleged Riigen test was successful, and as German researcher Friedrich Georg observes, the call then went out for \"secure delivery systems.,,12 It stands to reason then, that the Amerikoraket, given this alleged atomic bomb success and actual fuel air bomb success,1J was much more than a \"paper rocket.\" By the time of its successful testing in 1944, the paper studies and wind tunnel tests 10 Ibid., pp. 30-31.

This illustrates another facet of the Gennan secret programs, one overlooked by most authors, namely, that unlike olher countries, it appears that the Nazis gave the formal order for the development of these weapons after a test had been successfully completed. Thus, the order to \"develop\" such weapons should not be taken as an order to establish the research necessary to bring them to realization, but rather as the order to bring them to production. Ii is Ihus noteworthy that Hitler signs the order to \"develop\" the atomic bomb after the alleged test in RGgen occurs. The same, in fact, could be said of the V-2. for il is only after Hitler sees films of the rocket being successfully launched that he gives the order to develop it.

The rocket was, in other words, on the track to actual testing and production, All this leads us to General Kammler's January 31, 1945 order to evacuate Peenemiinde, According to the standard line, the explanation for this curious order is that the Red Anny was expected to arrive at any moment. But the Red Army would not arrive at Peenemiinde until May 4 th ! 14 This poses a significant question: Was Peenemiinde, as Friedrich Georg puts it, merely a \"ghost town\" for the three months from the evacuation order to the Russian arrival?15 The order is even more curious given the fact that, since the massive British Royal Air Force raid in 1943 that all but destroyed the facility, the process had already begun of moving as much of the V-2 production to underground sites as possible, True, the process was slow and still continuing when Kammler's 1945 order came down, but nonetheless, it was already well under way, By early 1945 most of the V-2 production was at the massive underground factory of the notorious Mittelwerk at Nordhausen, Thus the problem: Why give an order for something already taking place? One late war incident suggests, and suggests quite strongly, that this was not the case, for on March 9, 1945, a British twin- engine photo-reconnaissance Mosquito fighter-bomber was chased from Peenemiinde by no less than three German Messerschmitt 262 jet fighters,16 Of course, one possible explanation for the British presence at the site was that they were simply trying to confirm what their intelligence had probably already told them, namely, that Peenemiinde had been evacuated, But while that may explain the presence of the RAF Mosquito, it is not a good explanation for the - by that late date - relatively heavy presence of the Luftwaffe in the form of no less than three of its rare and valuable Messerschmitt 262 jet fighters, Three jets just to chase an unarmed British photo-reconnaissance plane from a \"ghost town\"? Clearly this makes no sense, and implies that something was sti II taking place at Peenemiinde, something very \"Geolg, SIal' Wors 1947, p, 75, \" Ibid\" p, 76, 16 Georg, SIal' Wors 1947, pp, 76-77, 41"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Peenemiinde Problem secret and very important, something requiring all the protection the crumbling Luftwaffe could muster. Seen in this way Kammler's \"evacuation\" order of January 31, 1945 thus appears to be a clever ploy by the security-obsessed SS general, designed to throw Allied and Soviet intelligence off the trail of whatever was still going on there. Since most of the V-I and V-2 teams were long gone from Peenemiinde to their new underground facilities, something else must have been going on that merited such heavy protection. But what was it? Fortunately, there do exist reports that during the period from March to April (and perhaps as late as May) 1945 that there were at least/our tests of a large rocket named \"Thor's Hammer\" or the Amerikarakel. These reports moreover name both Peenemiinde and Ohrdruf - site of the second alleged German a-bomb test on March 4, 1945 17 - as the possible sites of these tests. It is unlikely that Ohrdruf functioned as a test site for such a large rocket, since there was present there none of the necessary facilities to assemble and launch such a vehicle. So one is left with Peenemiinde, the most likely place. In any case, three of these tests were allegedly shots of the Amerikaraket into the Atlantic, and a fourth test was allegedly to see if orbit could be achieved! 18 But there is even further corroboration of mysterious goings-on at Peenemiinde at the war's end. 2. The\" Urals Incident\" Oddly, while Peenemiinde was visited only lightly by the British RAF after its massive 1943 air raid, it was visited often, and heavily, by the Soviet Red Air Force right up to the war's end, suggesting that, if the British had fallen for Kammler's ruse, the J1 Farrell, Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 80-88.

[t is an indication that they knew something that the Allies did not. Late-war German long-range rocket activity is corroborated, in fact, by the Russians themselves. In the Spanish language edition of the Soviet Russian science magazine Sputnik there is a report of the destruction in 1945 - during the war - of a Russian munitions factory in the Ural Mountains near the river Tobol. Notably, the article ascribed the destruction to a \"terror attack\" of \"fascist perfidy\" much like \"the later attacks of American B-52 bombers against the port city of Haiphong in Vietnam.,,19 If the Russian report is accurate and not merely a typical Communist exercise in disinformation or blame-shifting for their own bureaucratic incompetence, then this most probably was a rocket attack, since by that late date in the war the Luftwaffe had little left by way of long range heavy bombers able to make the trip,2° a trip that in any case had little prospect of success given the Red Air Force's mastery of the skies over eastern Europe. Only a rocket attack could guarantee success for such an operation. Given all the foregoing, it is reasonable to conclude that the Nazis may actually have been successful in testing the first strategic ballistic missiles toward the end of the war, while falling just short of getting them into production . ... .or is that too, yet another dangerous myth? We shall answer that question in a subsequent chapter. For now, we address another question. If the Nazis had indeed tested such long-range rockets, much less successfully fired one on Soviet Russia, then this implies that yet another phase of the Amerikaraket went beyond merely being a \"paper study.\" The Nazis could have tested all the long range rockets they wished, but they would have been utterly useless without a means to guide them to target. Thus, the existence of a credible long range and secure guidance system is also corroborative evidence that the Amerikaraket was not just a paper project. The question is, did the 19 Ibid., p. 80.

Over-l he-Horizon Radars and the Amerikaraket Successful German tests of long range rockets, much less an actual German rocket attack on Russian sites in the Urals, implies the existence of associated technologies and methods to guide such missiles accurately to their targets. Indeed, from the scientific and engineering point of view in the early 1940s, accurate guidance of such rockets was the principal problem that the Germans faced, not the actual rocket itself. A number of methods were therefore proposed to make the Amerikaraket accurate, some technological, others less so, Given that the A merikaraket was intended to carry \"small atom bombs,,21 and \"other weapons of mass destruction,,,22 and since the inertial guidance system of the V-2 would have been inadequate and inaccurate for attacking targets on the American east coast, the Nazis had to consider a variety of alternative modes for guidance. In other words, if the Amerikaraket was not a paper project, then one should expect the Germans to be working in each of the following areas: (I) technological and secure means of guiding a rocket to targets at long range; or, failing that, (2) alternative methods of guiding a rocket accurately to a target at long range; and, (3) technologies of miniaturizing enough rocket andlor A- bomb (or H-bomb or fuel-air bomb)23 components to enable a long range rocket to be able to carry such heavy payloads, \" Georg, Star Wars 1947, pp, 28-32, especially p, 31, 22 Ibid, 2l Q,v, my Reich oJthe Black Sun, pp, 190-193, 44"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood a/the Bell Viewed in this way, the Amerikaraket was anything but a paper project, since the Nazis considered any number of methods, from \"back-pack\" piloted rockets, to enable a pilot to guide the rocket to target visually before bailing out at the last minute, to actually planting a radio transponder inside the Empire State Building for a rocket to home in on,24 to much more sophisticated and ultimately much more secure technological means of guidance based on beam riding and radar interference. It is this last category that is of most lnterest to our purposes in this book, for it is this last area of development that points very clearly to Nazi interest in, and development of, areas of physics ultimately very different than those pursued by their Allied counterparts. I. The German Proto-Transistor And Television Minalurization Before examining German accomplishments in the technology of long-range rocket guidance, it is necessary to examine their success in the equally important area of miniaturization of components. Such a step was absolutely necessary if the Third Reich was ever to be successful in wedding its atom bomb - a notoriously heavy device in those days - to a rocket. Indeed, as 1 pointed out in Reich of the Black Sun, any and every method appears to have been pursued by Kammler's SS Sonderkommando, including techniques of boosting nuclear fission of atomic nuclei to lower the weight of the critical mass of a nuclear warhead 25 But there were other successes in miniaturization. It is well known that Nazj Germany, during the infamous 1936 Berlin Olympics, successfully created the first live television broadcast of a sports event for a general public. The following is a picture of one of the large and cumbersome television cameras - then \"state of the art\" - that were stationed at crucial locations around the Olympic stadium at Tempelhof Field in Berlin. 24 Friedrich Georg, Star Wars. p. 175. \" Reich a/the Black Sun. pp. 83-85. 45"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Peenemunde Problem 1936 German Television Camera at Ihe Berlin Olympics Television sets were placed at various locations in the Olympic village and the environs of Greater Berlin to allow the visiting athletes, tourists and German citizens to watch the games as they occurred. Needless to say, for Dr. Josef Gobbels' Propaganda Ministry it was a propaganda coup of the first order, and a clear demonstration to the world of German technological prowess. During the war, however, television quickly suggested itself to the Germans as a means of visually guiding a short-range missile to target by placing a television camera in the nose of a missile. Transmitting a picture back to an operator on the ground or in an airplane, the rocket could then be unerringly guided to target. And by war's end, they had successfully tested the first such \"smart bomb.,,26 Obviously, placing a television camera of the size oftbose used in the 1936 Olympic Games inside a missile was impractical, and so the camera had to be considerably miniaturized. By the war's end, the Germans had been hugely successful in this task, accomplishing an almost tenfold reduction in size, as this photo of a small television camera and receiver set, about the size of a large shoebox, attests: 26 Q.v., Reich of the Black Sun, p. 184. 46"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The 55 Brother/root! of the Bell Miniature German Television Camera for Missile Guidance Moreover, this miniaturization implies something enormously important, and its importance will become more and more apparent as we proceed in part two of this work, for such a tremendous reduction in size implies some sort of breakthrough in vacuum tube technology, if not in semi-conductor research itself. The mention of semi-conductors is intentional, for they may have accomplished much more, as the following picture demonstrates: Telefunken German \"Proto-Transistor\" ji-OI/1 J 940 The pictured klystron tube is the same approximate size as the last knuckle and fingertip of the reader's little finger!

The problematic may be glimpsed here as a kind of preview to part three, and it is best stated in conjunction with Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso's book, The Day After Roswell. 2. The Problem of the Miniature German Klystron Tube: Roswell, The E. T. Myth and the Nazi Legend Revisited Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso (US Army, Ret.) was perhaps something of a Godsend to UFO enthusiasts, for he corroborated - at least on the surface - the whole Roswell UFO-and-ET-crash and recovery scenario in his well-known book, The Day After Roswell. Corso's thesis is familiar to most people who have investigated the UFO literature. In his post as a top national security military officer, Corso maintains in his book that he was entrusted with some of the \"recovered technology\" from the \"alien craft\" that crashed at Roswell. His assignment was gradually to \"seed\" those aspects of \"recovered ET technology\" into American industry. Corso further maintains that among some of this \"recovered and gradually seeded\" technology were lasers, computers, fiber optics, and transistors.u Of course, after the book's appearance and Corso's own appearance on a popular overnight radio talk show, critical and historical analysis was all but suspended, and there was a further boost to the \"ET\" interpretation of the Roswell incident, all as a result of his book. 27 Georg, Star Wars, p. 91. \"Philip J. Corso, (Lt. Col, US Anny, Rei), The Day After Roswell, pp. 167- 168. 48"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell Crucial to Corso's case was the transistor, and he spends a great deal of time in his book demonstrating that his thesis of its \"ET -Roswell\" origin has to be true by pointing out that the history of the discovery of the transistor by Bell Laboratories is obscure at best. 29 The reason? Very simple. The transistor had no prior \"discovery history\" because it was \"ET\" in origin. But given what has now been demonstrated, we propose that, like the ambiguity in the MAJlC-12 documents themselves - vacillating between technologies clearly exotic though terrestrial and an \"ET\" cover story - there is another possible explanation for the origin of the transistor, one which, as we saw in Reich of the Black Sun,JO it would appear that the highest authorities, including the military, wish to keep covered up. That other possible source for the transistor, one that would much more satisfactorily explain its obscure discovery history than the ET hypothesis, is wartime Nazi research and accomplishment in semiconductor research. Simply put, Corso's work is, in this respect at least, pure obfuscation and disinfomlation, since one can only assume that a man of Corso's obvious intelligence could not have been unaware of German wartime scientific achievements, as plausibly demonstrated by the above miniature tube, fully seven years before the Roswell incident and its recovery of \"advanced ET technology.\" But there are other aspects of Corso's work that must also be called into question vis-a-vis the state of Nazi secret weapons research. Tt is well known that the Germans undertook and developed a wide range of infrared sites to enhance the night- fighting ability of their tanks and infantry. What is not generally known is the apparently high state of development of second and third generation technologies these infrared sites may have represented, for Polish researcher Igor Witkowski uncovered a certain amount of evidence in a recently declassified Alsos report that indicates preliminary work was undertaken in liquid C/Jlstals 29 Corso.

Over Ihe Horizon Radars One little known aspect of German wartime research is the area of over-the-horizon radars. While the Nazis were pursuing a number of options for the guidance of their intercontinental Amerikarakel, including a piloted version from which the pilot would eject at the last moment, the most preferred method was \"beam riding,\" a method that would allow the rocket to be guided to target by a beam. One project consisted of placing a secret radio transmitter inside the Empire State building for the purpose!32 But by far the most serious and promising - and technologically involved - methods were the various Over-the- Horizon Radars that the Germans were developing for the purpose, the sets Elefanl, See-Elefant, and the mobile Freya unit. The Elefant set was developed by the Research Department of the Deutsche ReischspOsl, and was the world's first genuine over-the- horizon radar based on temperature inversions in the ionosphere]3 The See-Elefant was a further development of this equipment, and was built in western Denmark and consisted of a sending antenna, approximately 100 meters high, placed between two permanent receiving antennae some distance to either side. It was a broadband antenna system, operating in the 23-29 MHz, 24-30MHz, and 30- 38 MHz range. 34 But the most advanced of these early over-the-horizon radars was the Freya unit, a \"revolutionary system\" that was \"fully mobile.,,35 The Freya unit's basic principle of operation is visible from this German schematic from 1945: 31 Witkowski, The Truth About the WundenvafJe, p. 158. l2 Friedrich Georg, Star Wars, p. 175.

This is a true phased array radar, able to shape and bend its signals around the curvature of the earth, or \"over the horizon.\" Artist's Sketch of Freya Consequently, the Germans, in spite of some technical shortcomings of their radar operations during the war, were experimenting in areas that were quite advanced for the day: (a) Broadband radar systems based on (b) Phased array \"signal shaping\" for (c) Over-the-horizon, or \"action at a distance\" operation.

All of this was, of course, for the long-range guidance of their projected intercontinental rockets. In any case, the accuracy of these types of systems had been brought to a high state by the Germans by October of 1943. By that time, the accuracy was such that it was able to guide aircraft at a distance of 105 kilometers, during a bombing run, to release their bombs within 600 meters of their target, even though it was not visible to them. 37 However, as will be seen in a later chapter, the Germans may have discovered something while operating these sophisticated radar units that indicated they were a door beckoning to a whole new type of physics, one with a far greater promise than mere long-range rockets carrying atomic bombs. The real question, the one that will now preoccupy us for the remainder of this book, remains: why would the military- industrial-national security complex be so concerned to deflect attention away jrom Nazi scientific achievements - an effort represented by Colonel Corso's The Day After Roswell - even at this late date, unless there is something it still wishes to hide? The answer is twofold. The most important part of the answer lies in what the Germans may have discovered with these radar sets, a part with which we shall have much to do when we finally turn to examine the exotic type of physics the Nazis may have been developing in part two. For now we will turn to a less important reason, the reason that, if one pulled on the thread long enough and hard enough, would inevitably lead one to ask questions about the \"public consumption\" history of the race to the moon, the most visible aspect of the survival of Nazi research projects and their \"creative financing\" in the post-war world. 3J Ibid., p. 99. 53"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"3. \".1' rom l\\.u.s.sia witb JLohe:\" m:be m:i.lJo ~pa(e l:lrollram5 ~!,potbe5i5 \"The Second World War was an air war; Ihe Third World War will be a space war . ..

All of them believe, in some fashion, that there have been, for quite some time, two space programs, one for public consumption, and another deeply covert one with its own agenda. And the idea is not confined to books or non-fiction. In the classic James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever, a young Sean Connery tracks down a plot for world domination by the sinister \"independent villain\" Ernst Stavro Blohfeld to a kidnapped eccentric multi-billionaire - played by country singer Jimmy Dean - who lives in a Las Vegas penthouse, and to his secret corporate headquarters somewhere in the Nevada desert.

These film facts have long led those who believe that the Apollo lunar landings were hoaxed to maintain that Ian Fleming, creator of the famous British spy character and himself an intelligence agent during the war, was leaking \"inside information.\" Apparently Ian Fleming was not the only one involved in such \"leaks,\" for another famous movie, Seven Days in May, this time by Rod Serling, celebrated creator of the famous Twilight Zone television series, told the story of an attempted right-wing military coup against a weak and apparently \"liberal\" President. The coup was centered on a secret military base somewhere in the desert of the American southwest. So real was Serling's screenplay that the release of the movie was actually delayed after the assassination of President Kennedy for fears that it might raise too many questions. And that may not have been entirely coincidental, for President Kennedy had indeed given actual assistance to Serling when he was writing his screenplay. Did Kennedy let Serling know, in so many terms, about Area 51? And, to round out the picture, another famous movie contributed significantly in conspiracy circles to the view of \"movies-as-deliberate-Ieaks\". The movie was Capricorn One. In the movie, three astronauts are placed into a space capsule bound for Mars on mankind's first manned flight to the Red Planet.

A. The Two Space Program Hypothesis If anything emerges from these three famous \"cult film\" classics, it is a theme one encounters quite frequently in some \"conspiracy\" literature, aspects of which are as follows: (I) The Apollo Moon missions, or at least some aspects of them, were a hoax, and the Apollo missions did not happen in exactly the way we were told they happened; (2) As a corollary to this idea, there is the notion that there are two space programs, one for public consumption, and another hidden one, being controlled or coordinated by the military-industrial complex; (3) People have been murdered, or at least died under mysterious circumstances, who have attempted to expose this secret program and public hoax; and finally, if one adds Serling's plot into this mix, (4) There is some element or aspect of a coup d 'etat hovering in the background. We shall call these four elements the \"Two Space Programs\" Hypothesis. And as will be seen below as the main non-fictional versions of it are examined, there are indeed unusually cogent arguments that at least some version of the hypothesis may in fact be true. 1. The Torbitl Document Version Perhaps the most famous and yet paradoxically least known version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis is that of the so- called \"Torbitt\" document on the assassination of President Kennedy. Well-known to JFK assassination researchers since its first appearance in photocopied \"samizdat\" form in the 1970s, the document is hardly known at all to the general public, even 56"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell amongst those inclined to believe that some sort of conspiracy was involved in the assassination. Such a response, however, hardly captures the document's singular importance.

Its truly remarkable contents are even more explosive considering the fact that in almost no version of the JFK assassination conspiracy that make their rounds every few years when a new book is published on the subject, are the Torbitt Document's main characters ever mentioned. Indeed, not even Garrison dwelt too long on this particular aspect that his own investigators discovered, and Oliver Stone ignored this aspect of the story completely in his celebrated movie on the Garrison investigation, JFK. Nonetheless, the Committee on Assassinations in the 1970s took it seriously enough to entirely prohibit discussion or even mention of any possible Nazi connection with the assassination. But what could have been so sensational about a single pseudonymously authored \"samizdat\" manuscript privately circulated in assassination conspiracy circles? Keno Thomas once again summarizes some of its highly unusual contents: It makes connections to such then-unknown governmental spy agencies as Defense Industrial Security Command and Division Five of the FBI; it suggests that a fonner prime minister of Hungary was the infamous \"umbrella man\" seen in the Zapruder film; it introduces to the assassination lore such personalities as Fred Crisman (spelled Chrismon\" by Torbin) as one of the railroad tramps behind Ihe grassy knoll.'

What he should be doing on the grassy knoll clearly signaling someone by closing his umbrella just as President Kennedy's limousine is driving by, no one knows. And as if that were not strange enough, the Crisman referred to is none other than Fred Chrisman, well known for his involvement in the infamous Maury Island UFO affair in 1947 in Seattle-Tacoma, Washington 5 Just what this oddball cast of characters should have to do with the Kennedy assassination not even the Torbitt document pretends to know, as no explanations or possible motivations are offered. But one can imagine the perplexity of District Attorney Garrison when he learned of Chrisman's odd background prior to serving a subpoena on him! In any case, a clue to it all is perhaps afforded by the reference to the \"Defense Industrial Security Command\". What was this entity? Here, it is best to cite the Torbitt document itself, rather than Thomas' introduction: The killing of Presideot Kennedy was planoed and supervised by Division Five of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a relatively small department within the FBI whose usual duties are espionage and counter-espionage activities. Actually, Division Five acted dually with the Defense Intelligence Agency which was acting on behalf of the Joints Chiefs of Staff (sic) in the Pentagon. Directly under the two-pronged leadership of Division Five and the D1A was the Control Group, their highly secret police agency - the Defense lndustrial Securiry Command. The Defense Industrial Securiry Command has always been kept secret because it acts, in addition to its two official control organizations, on behalf of NASA, the Atomic Energy Commission, U.S. [nformation Agency, and the arms. equipment, ammunition, munitions and related miscellaneous supply manufacturing corporations contracting with NASA, the AEC, UStA, and the Pentagon .... , The Maury Island affair is one of the more unusual UFO-debris retrieval cases, long regarded by most UFOlogists as a complete hoax. Chrisman claimcd to have recovered slag·like debris from a \"malfullctioning\" UFO while on a boat in Puget Sound. The debris was later examined and allegedly placed in a cereal box to be flown to an Air Force base. But the debris never made it to the base, as the twin engine bomber flying it inexplicably crashed. 58"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell The Defense Industrial Security Command had its beginnings when J. Edgar Hnover in the early 1930's organized the police force of the Tennessee Valley Authority at the request of David Lilienthal. The police force covered the entire TVA from Knoxville, Tennessee through Huntsville and Florence, Alabama and into Kentucky and back through the eastern portion of Tennessee into southern Kentucky. This was one of the first federal agencies with a separate police force. This force grew and Lilienthal took it forward to cover the Atomic Energy Commission, thus tying it into the army intelligence service . .... A Swiss corporation, Pennindcx, was used to head five front organizations responsible for furnishing personnel and supervisors to carry out assigned duties (in the assassination). The five groups under Permindex and their supervisors were: I. The Czarist Russian, eastern European and Middle East exile organization called SOLIDARISTS, (sic) headed by Ferenc agy, ex-Hungarian premier, and John DeMenil, Russian exile from Houston, Texas, a close friend and supporter of Lyndon Johnson for over thirty years. 2. A section of the AMERICA COUNCIL OF CHRJSTlAN CHURCHES headed by HL Hunt of Dallas, Texas. 3. A Cuban exile group called FREE CUBA COMMITTEE headed by Carlos Prio Socarras, ex-Cuban president. 4.

These are sensational allegations, indeed, so much so that one might be tempted to dismiss the document entirely, were it not for the fact that it is but a summary of the more unusual aspects of the Garrison investigation. 6 This is an inaccuracy, since the Nazi government was not formed until President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Reich Chancellor and asked him to form a government on January 30, 1933. 7 NASA, Nazis, and JFK: The Torbitl Document and the JFK Assassination, pp.24-27.

H.L. Hunt and an organization that is basically connected to fundamentalist-evangelical revivalist \"Protestantism,\" in other words, big oil masking behind a missionary organization;9 2. A group of Eastern European exiles of right-wing political complexion, \"headed by Ferenc Nagy.\" Let us pause a moment to consider these new players on the scene. Most JFK conspiracy literature does mention Lee Harvey Oswald's and Marina Oswald's connection to the Russian and White Russian emigre community in Dallas, and in turn the connections of that community to big oil. Nonetheless, not much is made of this connection. It is as if researchers do not really know what to make of it. About all that one typically encounters is the fact that the Oswalds' landlord, Ruth Paine, was involved in this community, and that her husband, Michael, worked for Bell Aerospace, the same Bell Aerospace that employed General Walter Dornberger, military head of Hitler's V-2 project in conjunction with Werner Von Braun. But here most assassination researchers stop, not really noticing that the Nazi connections would multiply like rabbits, if one cared to look for them, for the fact of the matter is, the various societies, organizations, and groups of this Eastern 8 I should make it clear that I do flol believe the \\Varren Commission version of the assassination, and do believe that a conspiracy was involved, one that most likely was composed of at least the elements outlined here. 9 The American Council of Christian Churches did publish literature against theological liberalism as well as funded missionaries in Central and Soutb America. However, it is known that some of its members used it as a front to train death squads and conduct assassinations in those areas. Some have alleged that the organization was actually established by the \"intelligence community\" for precisely this purpose, and to launder money into this country. 60"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood o/the Bell European emigre community were but the North American connections - the leftovers, so to speak - of the vast network of German military intelligence that operated on and behind the Russian front throughout World War Two. This military intelligence group was called Fremde Heere Ost (Foreign Armies East) and was headed by General Reinhard Gehlen. We shall have much more to say both about this intelligence network and its commanding general later. For now, however, it is to he noted that the Torhitt document, by naming Ferenc Nagy as \"head\" of this emigre community, is perhaps speaking symbolically, pointing the finger to a very hidden Nazi presence in the assassination. We are now in a position to examine the last new player in the assassination that the document mentions: 3. NASA security, headed by Von Braun, working inside the Defense Industrial Security Command (D.I.S.C.!) at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. In other words, the third new player in the assassination is the space program, and the Torbitt Document further implies that it is an aspect of the space program that is not only relatively hidden from the general public, but also which is under the direct control of Werner Von Braun, yet another Nazi connection. But what of the \"Permindex Corporation\" in Switzerland, the entity allegedly coordinating all this malfeasance for the FBI and DIA? Who was involved with it? What were its purposes? A glance at its Board of Directors indicates why it attracted the attention of District Attorney Garrison, for among those on its board were, of course, Clay Shaw, the man Garrison actually indicted for conspiracy to murder the president. But others included an Italian Fascist who had married into the family of Hjalmar Schacht,1O Hitler's president of the Reichsbank and finance minister, and interestingly enough, also father-in-law to Hitler's favorite SS commando, Otto Skorzeny.

And, at the end of this list, as if to highlight its importance, is NASA and its contractors, who, notes the Torbitt Document, \"are directed by the Defense Industrial Security Command,\" which is headed by Werner Von Braun. But directed to do what? Why would Werner Von Braun possibly be involved in such an affair? The answer, perhaps, lies in the Torbitt Document's stated purposes of the Permindex Corporation: I. To fund and direct assassinations of European, Mid-East and world leaders considered threats to the Western World and to petroleum interests of the backers. 2. To furnish couriers, agents, and management in transporting, depositing and re-channeling funds through Swiss banks for Las Vegas, Miami, Havana and international gambling syndicate. 3. To co-ordinate the espionage activities of the Solidarists and Division Five of the FBI with groups in sympathy with their objectives and to receive and channel funds and 3T1llS from the financiers to the action groups. 4. To build, acquire and operate hotels and gambling casinos in the Caribbean, Italy and at other tourist areas. 14 Perm index, in other words, was the \"Murder Incorporated\" referred to by subsequent American Presidents. But what does all this mean? What do these \"purposes\" indicate about the real nature of Permindex and its \"backers\"? Note first of all the purpose of eliminating, by assassination, any threat to the \"petroleum interests of the backers.\" In other words, big oil once again. Note also, that any alternative technology sllch as those represented by cold fusion. or \"zero point energy\" devices. would represent precisely such a threat. So one may safely assume that one is to take \"the protection of the oil interests\" in the widest possible sense, as not only eliminating foreign governments or parties that would threaten these interests' overseas investments, \" NASA.

Points two and three, however, point to something even deeper, and that is not only a hidden intelligence connection - a group operating within or only in conjunction with established and official agencies of the U.S. Federal government - but also a means for the independent financing of such groups and means of laundering the money to do it: casinos, ideal vehicles for laundering vast amounts of money quickly. This would explain the Mafia connection and involvement: it was at a \"low\" level of the conspiracy, the level necessary only for ensuring easy access and flow of dirty money to finance these projects. All this makes a very strange context in which to view the last component of Permindex's backers, \"NASA contractors directed by the Defense Industrial Security Command.\" What possible connection could NASA's DISC under the direction of Von Braun have to do with this? One answer, perhaps, lies in the implied suggestion that Permindex may have conducted assassinations to protect more than just the oil industry. The Torbitt Document later provides an indicator of just who might have really been pulling the strings in the \"corporation\" when it stated \"Permindex in Switzerland, basically a NATO intelligence front using the remnants of Adolph Hitler's intelligence units in West Germany and also, the intellijlence unit of the Solidarists headquarters in Munich, Germany.,,1 Munich was, of course, also General Reinhard Gehlen's personal headquarters for his Gehlenorg,16 the network of spies and \"Solidarists\" he continued to run both behind the Iron Curtain and elsewhere, ostensibly for the Central Intell igence Agency and the West Gernlan Bundesnachrich/endienst.

While the Torbitt Document ultimately does not provide much of an answer to this question, it does hint at an answer that, shorn of its Nazi associations, will become a standard theme in some conspiracy views on the assassination, most notably that of Oliver Stone in his famous movie on the Garrison investigation, JFK. The Torbitt Document raises the prospect of the immense profits to be made from war, namely, the war in Vietnam: The Nazi scientists are on management level also in the mlU1itions and aerospace industry. Walter Domberger, the Nazi general, left the space agency in the 1950's to become a high official in Bell Aerospace Corporation and he was followed by over thirty of the Nazi scientists to control level in the corporations manufacturing munitions and aerospace material. This still left well over sixty of the scientists at command level in NASA.\" Of course, in the 1950s the war in Vietnam was ending its French phase and only entering the American one, but in any case, the motive is clearly implied: there were big profits to be made in war. Moreover, the positioning of these Paperclip Project Nazis in key American defense industries may be an indicator of something far di fferent taking place: the extension of influence by means of interlocking personnel in many management positions. This may easily be understood by recalling a method noted by many other writers on conspiracy, namely, that the method whereby power was concentrated in fewer and fewer hands by such financial dynasties as Rockefeller, Morgan, Warburg, or Rothschild, was simply to insist, as part of a condition of receiving a loan or grant from their institutions, that those institutions themselves were allowed to seat a representative on the loan recipient's governing board. This was usually done by collateralizing the loan with stock in the company receiving the loan. Here, a similar pattern is at least implied: these Nazi scientists may have been acting to extend their own independent nerwork of power and influence throughout the American military-industrial complex by being seated in senior management positions in return \" Ibid., p. 85. 65"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"\"From Rus!,'ia witlt Love\" for their expertise. We shall present evidence later that will corroborate this. In any case, viewed against the backdrop of General Gehlen's effective preservation of his spy network and its grafting and penetration into post-war American intelligence, the picture that now emerges from the Torbitt document is chilling in its potentialities. Each of the Nazi connections alluded to in the Torbin document indicate influential Nazi presence not only in America's space program, but moreover, strongly hint of Nazi influence in the awarding of contracts for the space program, Nazi influence in control of the security of the space program, Nazi influence in the intelligence organs of America and the West, Nazi influence in the defense and aerospace industries, and Nazi influence lurking in the background of Permindex, \"Murder Incorporated.\" Indeed, Von Braun himself may be viewed as the best exemplar of the type of smiling, glad-handing \"networking\" that make such influence possible, for shortly after arriving in the United States, he made a point of befriending none other than J. Edgar Hoover, and the then Senator Lyndon Johnson. 19 And who was one of the individuals who helped expedite Von Braun's and Dornberger's repatriation to the United States? None other than Clay Shaw, the man Garrison would ultimately indict for conspiracy to murder President Kennedy20 The transfer of the Nazi Project Paperclip scientists was also aided by none other than General Gehlen 21 All we know about the pseudonymous William Torbitt was that he was a prominent attorney in South Texas politics in the 1960s and 1970s. 22 This makes the Torbitt Document's revelations all the more sensational.

It suggests that this was one of the many motivations represented by the various groups that whose interests coalesced in the murder of the President. But beyond that, it does not go. And this leaves a very disturbing question hovering in the aIr: [f there \\Vas some hidden aspect to the space program, and if its principals had some motivation for participating in the murder of the President, what was it? What did this hidden aspect of the space program have to gain? Or, alternatively, what about President Kennedy threatened it; what did it have to protect? Or was it some combination of both? To answer these questions requires an examination of some of the other versions of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis, even, as we shall see, the absurd ones. 2. The False Planetmy Geology, Climate, and Archaeology Versions: a. The Absurdist Versions One may summarize the \"absurdist\" versions of the Two Space Programs very easily: The Moon has an atmosphere and water, and even vegetation. Venus, beneath its canopy of clouds, is not the carbon dioxide pressure-cooker and barren desert greenhouse we've been told, but rather, a temperate planet of rich vegetation, a veritable paradise. And, if one believes Adamski - and this author most decidedly does not - it is home to a wonderful race of peaceful, blonde- haired, blue-eyed, human space brothers who come in peace to bring earth-bound humanity a message of hope. And Mars really does have canals, and, thankfully, isn't planning an invasion of Earth anytime soon. But what has this to do with a hidden and public space program? 67"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"\"From Russia with Love\" Very simple: according to the absurdist version the governments of the world that have space programs have hidden the truth about the planets of our solar system, carefully doctoring pictures to edit out any evidence that shows any of the above! b. A Scientifically and Politically Plausible Version: The Hoagland Model A much more serious model, and much more plausible one, has been argued in various ways over the years by Richard C Hoagland, best known for his association with the ongoing investigations of the anomalous Martian surface features in the Cydonia region of Mars, features he believes strongly suggest an artificial origin. While an extended presentation of Hoagland's views is not possible here - after all they have evolved over many years of continual research, requiring a scholarly study in their own right - there are certain stable features that one may point to as summarizing some aspects of his version: I. The Brookings Report: Immediately after its formation, NASA commissioned a study of the possible impact of human contact with an extraterrestrial civilization in its explorations of the solar system, or alternatively, with human discovery of any artifacts of such a civilization. As Hoagland has pointed out on more than one occasion, the Brookings report indicated that there might be severe cultural implications and repercussions of such discoveries or events. Thus, Hoagland argues, the government may have adopted the policy, based on the Brookings recommendations, of concealing such discoveries. 2. In this context, one way of concealment is the alteration of photographic or other scientific data that indicates the presence of such contact or civilization artifact. Another method is the outright dismissal of evidence after-the-fact, such as NASA's post-Viking dismissal of the Face on Mars as nothing but a \"trick of light and shadow.\" These and other tactics were subsequently employed by NASA down 68"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"rhe SS Brotherhood 0/ the Bell to the present whenever anomalous findings are returned by space probes. 3. A third component of Hoagland's view is that there is a \"hidden space program\", or better, group within NASA, exercising influence in an esoteric or occult direction over the scheduling, naming, and symbolism attached to missions. In support of this allegation, Hoagland has noted the high predominance of Masons in the astronaut corps, particularly in the formative days of NASA during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs. Additionally, Hoagland has also maintained that many missions are designed to align with significant celestial (astrological) correlations, as if space missions were deliberate acts in a vast system of ritual magic being done on a planetary scale via the space program itself. 4. The final and most important component in Hoagland's model is that the surface features of Cydonia on Mars encode a lost \"hyperdimensional physics,\" a physics Hoagland sees in evidence in the planetary upwellings of energy at the \"tetrahedral latitude\" of 19.5 north or south degrees on every celestial body in the solar system. While such assertions may sound fantastic, the fact that they are made by someone of Hoagland's stature is significant, and, as we shall see below, the more one digs beneath the surface of various versions of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis, and the more details one uncovers, Hoagland's version seems to pale into mundane normalcy by comparison. 3. The \"Alternative Three\" Version Among the many versions of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis, none is more bizarre nor more famous than the Alternative 3 version. Alternative 3 was a \"documentary\" produced for the British science series Science Report, which aired on Anglia television in the 1970s. Originally scheduled to air on April 1, 1977, the broadcast was delayed and did not air until June, though in the 69"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"\"From Russia witlt Love 'i production credits April 1 is listed as the date. The \"documentary\" was one hour long, and makes interesting viewing. 23 Ostensibly the \"documentary\" begins by investigating the so-called \"brain drain\" that was affecting Great Britain during the 1970s, as many of ber top scientists and engineers left the country for more prosperous and promising positions overseas, most notably in Canada and the United States, and to a lesser extent Australia and New Zealand. Moving quickly, the documentary \"uncovers\" the cases of three scientists who simply were never heard from again, despite attempts of their \"families\" to contact them. Finally, one scientist died in a mysterious automobile accident, allegedly after placing a telephone call from a remote country phone booth to a journalist friend of his, to whom he had sent a computer memory tape. On the tape, when it was finally \"decoded\" by the indefatigable investigative journalists of Anglia Television, was a video recording of an alleged joint Russian-American Mars landing in 1962, complete with video recording of sub-surface life burrowing a furrow on the ground to the wild and thrilled cheers of the Russian and American ground control crews in the background! With missing scientists and engineers, a mysteriously dead scientist, and a computer tape of an alleged Mars landing, the journalists learn of a hidden, secret joint space program being conducted by the Americans and Russians, a component of which was to persuade the best and brightest of the world's scientists to participate in the gradual, and very secret, colonization of the Moon and Mars. The purpose of this colonization? The world's elite had concluded tbat the planet was being destroyed by humanity, and that overpopulation had passed the point of no return, and that life on Earth was doomed. Three alternatives were discussed to save the situation. The first was to explode nuclear warheads in the atmosphere, in an attempt to create a \"hole\" which would bleed off the pollution. The second was to build vast underground installations in which humanity could survive wben the surface became unviable. And the third, Alternative 3. was to seek new planetary homes on the Moon and Mars. 23 The author has actually watched the \"documentary\" many times. 70"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"rhe 55 Brotherhood of the Bell The secret space program was thus a modern-day Noah's Ark, and the most heinous crimes were being perpetrated to ensure the success of Alternative 3.

In fact, the network was flooded with calls from thnusands of people who professed their belief in the whole wi Id scenarin, and who in some cases added their own stories of encounters with the \"hidden masters\" of the project. The problem was, the whole program was a complete hoax, an elaborate April Fools' Day joke, intended as such by the producers and authors of the teleplay, David Ambrose and Christopher Miles,24 a fact that would have been evident from careful examination of the closing credits, with its very clearly stated date, and long list of cast which included professional actors 25 The story would not die, however, and was soon followed by a badly-written book of the same title, about which more in a moment. To one Canadian inquiring about the truth of the \"documentary,\" co-author and producer Christopher Miles stated: \"The idea for the film and subsequently the book. was sometbiog that David (Ambrose) and I dreamed up over a lunch together in London, as I was getting rather tired of the doeu-drama on television and wanted to prove how easy it is to lead the general public up the proverbial garden path!

Along the way instances of Russian- American cooperation in space are described, and we are offered accounts of the plights of several amnesia victims, but none of this has much to do with the core of the Alternative 3 thesis.\" At the end of it all - a book and a \"documentary\" - what does one make of Alternative 3? Jim Keith summarizes the whole episode this way: In summary, Alternative 3 is a teleplay and a book which utterly lack substantiation, and the book in particular is written in a style identical to the Weekly World News of \"Two-Headed Space Alien Gives Birth to Elvis' Lovechild\" fame. What propels Alternative 3 along in the manner of a 1940s Amazing Stories extravaganza set in the vicinity of Fleet Street are the \"secret documents,\" the interviews with persons who do not exist and, more than that, the word of the authors who, while repeatedly maintaining \"We are only interested in facts,\" write a television show and book loaded with as many questionable conclusions as the latest Brad Steiger UFO masterpiece .. ... All the references to flights to Mars, \"batch consignments\" and so forth are found in the poorly rendered and unbelievable \"secrel transcripts\" or created from thin Martian air by the authors?8 But, as Keith himself notes, one comes away from viewing the \"documentary\" and/or reading the book with an uneasy feeling, notwithstanding their clear and evident narure as hoaxes, and that uneasy feeling is that Alternative 3 and its various themes are quite close to the truth, that something like the odd goings on in the \"documentary\" acrually are occurring. In fact, Leslie Watkins, who co-authored the book version with the \"documentary's\" producers for Penguin Books, wrote a researcher who had contacted the Penguin editor, that the book was 27 Ibid., p. 17. 28 Ibid., pp. 19-20. 72"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell \"based on fact, but uses that fact as a launchpad for a high dive into fiction.\" And a little later in his letter, Watkins recounts the unusual events that befell him after the book version was published and in circulation: \"For some time after Alternative 3 was originally published, 1 have reason to suppose that my home telephone was being tapped and my contacts who were experienced in such matters were convinced that certain intelligence agencies considered that I probably knew too much. So, summing up, the book is fiction based on fact. But I now feel that 1 inadvertently got very close to a secret truth . .. 29 But if Watkins, Miles, and Ambrose had come too close to \"a secret truth\" that would call forth electronic wiretapping in response, what exactly in the crazy quilt-work of the Alternative 3 universe was it? The universe of Alternative 3 is clear enough: there is a secret space program involving both Russians and Americans in cooperation, being controlled by some entity that transcends their governments and uses them for its own ends, which is the secret colonization of the Moon and Mars. To this end, it persuades or kidnaps scientists, and \"commoners\" for manual labor. Those it cannot \"persuade\" or who threaten to expose the project, are murdered. So one has the following elements: I. Several missing scientists, in great numbers; 2. Murdered scientists; 3. Several missing \"common\" people; 4. A secret space program existing inside of, or parallel to, the public programs in Russia and America; 5. Colonies on the Moon and/or Mars; and finally, 6. Some entity coordinating all the above. Conspiracy researcher Jim Keith investigated these aspects of the case, and came to a rather provocative conclusion, a conclusion so provocative, in fact, that he seldom states it directly, though much of his book, Mind Control and UFOs: Casebook on Alternative 3, 29 Jim Keith, Casebook on Allert/alive 3, p. 22, emphasis original. 73"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"\"From Russia with Love\"' implies this conclusion simply by virtue of the amount of time he spends exploring it. We begin with point number 2 above: the deaths of scientists. Keith, like many other authors, noted the very strange fact that many European scientists, physicists, and engineers who were involved with, or otherwise might have something to contribute to President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, seemed to have unusually high suicide or \"death-by-mysterious- circumstances\" rates. And oddly, most of these scientists were from Western Europe. Proportionally fewer Americans, Canadians or Australians were involved in the unusual deaths. Among those that Keith lists were: Keith Bowden, supercomputer expert; Roger Hill, a designer for Marconi Defense Systems (who allegedly killed himself by shotgun blast); Jonathan Walsh, digital communications expert for Marconi's parent firm, GEC; Karl-Heinz Beckurts, director of research for Germany's Siemens Company and his driver; and, notes Keith, \"an SDI contractor allegedly linked to activities of Otto Skorzeny's Nazi International;\" Vimal Dajibhai, an expert in computer guidance systems; Gerrold von Braunmuhl, a high advisor to West Germany's Defense Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher; Ashad Shariff, another Marconi employee; a Swedish professor, Svante Oden; an Italian electronics executive, Lando Conti; Aytar Singh- Gida, an SOl technology expert; Richard Pugh, British Defense Ministry contracts worker; John Brittan, computer expert; Swedish arms inspector Cal Frederik Algernon ... and on and on Keith's list goes. 30 Like the \"mysterious deaths\" of key witnesses and personnel that followed the assassination of President Kennedy, rather too many scientists and engineers were dying in too many suspiciolls ways for the whole episode to be entirely coincidental. Keith observes that: In July of 1986, Kurt Rebmann, Germany's Federal Prosecutor, told the New York Times that he believed the attacks were part of a \"coordinated offensive\" against the West and the SOl program.

In at least two of the cases, those of Beckurts and von Braunmuhl, the Marxist Red Army Faction (RAF) claimed responsibility. In Italy a note was found at the location of Griogieri 's murder, stating thar he \"was struck down exclusively for his responsibility exercised following the Italian adhesion to the Star Wars project.\" And attributing the murder to the Italian Red Brigades. Of course, notes can easily be faked, and the fact that responsibility was claimed in only three cases is odd if two groups performed all the murdcrs. J1 One explanation, the obvious one, is that \"it was apparent to the Kremlin that SOL, far from bring the defensive program that it was touted as by Ronald Reagan, had an awesome offensive capability.',)2 This much is true, as we shall see in pan twO]3 But in any case, Keith's conclusion is rational: the most obvious perpetrators of the strange deaths were the Soviets, who hoped to dissuade the West from deploying SOl. But according to Keith, there was likewise another possibility: \"It has also occurred to me that if there is in fact a secret flying disk technology on this planet, withheld for its surprise strike capability from some unknown quarter, then SOT might have been seen as a technology capable of pinpointing and shooting down such craft.',34 That is, if there was an \"independent group\" perfecting such advanced craft, then that group, too, would view SOl as a threat and seek to derail it, or, conversely, seek to acquire and deploy its technologies while denying them to its enemies. It is this possibility that informs the bulk of Keith's book. Tracing the possibilities to a pre-war network of American and Nazi business contacts, he quickly comes to one locus of possibilities: the \"surrender\" of Germany's Foreign Armies East (Fremde Heere OSI) section of military intelligence to the ass, a deal that was negotiated between General Reinhard Gehlen and ass station chief in Zurich, Allen Dulles, later chief of the CrA and a member of the Warren Commission.

As we trace the actions and connections of these men, the conspiratorial web will radiate outward, and perhaps begin to take on a definite and ominous pattern. The study is taken up shortly after the collapse of the Third Reich, when General Reinhard Gehlen, Nazi spymaster and Knight of Malta- to-be began negotiations with Allen Dulles and the American OSS (Office of Strategic Services). Using Nazi intelligence networks as a hole card to provide for his own survival and the survival of his huge spy network, Gehlen made a separate peace with Dulles, resulting in the clean grafting of Nazi spy apparatus to the American clandestine services. This was the birth of the CIA and part of a nexus of betrayal that continues to this day.35 Indeed, as many others have pointed out, at the inception of the CIA, the agency's \"Soviet desk\" for all intents and purposes consisted almost entirely and exclusively of this Nazi spy network 36 Gehlen's own words recalling this bargain are clinically chilling: I remember the terms of the agreement well ... I. A clandestine German intelligence organization was to be set up. using the existing potential to continue infonnation gathering in the East just as we had been doing before.

Simpson and other commentators have often pointed out that one effect of this \"Nazification\" of American intelligence in the inunediate post-war world was the over-estimation of Soviet military power and intentions. Another effect was the corresponding American military build-up and, to a lesser extent, the Marshal Plan itself. Yet another effect was the covert policy of \"rollback\", a policy designed to make use of Gehlen's fifth columns in Eastern Europe - and in North America! - of emigre White Russians, Ukrainians, Letts, Lithanians, and so on. 76"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell from the Americans until a new government was established in Germany. 4.

As soon as a sovereign German government was established, the government should decide whether the organization should continue to function or not, but that until such time the care and control (later referred to as \"the trusteeship\") of the organization would remain in American hands. 6. Should the organization at any time find itself in a position where the American and German interests diverged, it \\Vas accepted that the organization would consider the interests o/Germanyfirst. 37 In other words, one whole department of the American Federal govemment - indeed, one of its most sensitive deparhllents - was being run by agents of the Third Reich in a classic Trojan Horse operation!38 With the thousands of agents in Gehlen's \"Organization,\" and its extensive network of'''~migre exile\" groups and fronts, historian Carl Oglseby noted that the Gehlenorg \"substantially pre-empted the CIA's civilian character before it was ever born ... Thus, whatever the CIA was from the standpoint of law, it remained from the standpoint of practical intelligence collection a front for a house of Nazi spies. ,,]9 The importance of these observations cannot be pondered too long, for as many other researchers and commentators have noted, there appears to be a \"rogue element\" operating somewhere inside the U.S. Federal government and inside its intelligence community. Keith's observations, and similar ones made by others who have researched the incredible bargain struck between Allen Dulles and General Gehlen, give a historical background and foundation to these fears: There not only is a rogue element within the American intelligence community, but it has been there since the end of World War Two.

Who those eliminated are depends upon who are weakest and who are strongest in the competition which necessarily ensues. 41 If that sounds vaguely like an anti-Jewish rant of Hitler at a Nuremburg party rally, think again. The words are those of Allen Dulles' brother, John Foster Dulles, who would later become the American Secretary of State under President Dwight Eisenhower. In any case, Gehlen's bargain with Dulles was but one aspect of the creation of a vast post-war \"Nazi International,\" an organization with massive amounts of money, and, as has been seen, its own intelligence network. Maintaining close ties to each other and other escaped Nazis, this nern'ork evolved into \\vhat has been termed the Nazi lntemational, run by Otto Skorzeny and headquartered in Madrid. The Nazi International would be key in the establishment of worldwide arms, terrorist, and drug trafficking networks, although these crimes pale in comparison with the subversion of American intelligence, in collaboration with Allen Dulles, the result of which may be said to have been the creation of the Cold War and the continuing destruction of democracy in America. 42 Skorzeny most likely was a front man for other more high-ranking Nazis, since he was the son-in-law to former Reichsbank president Hjalmar Horace Greeley Scbacht.

While the evidence is scanty, it is nonetheless provocative. It begins with America's High Commissioner in Germany in the immediate post-war period: John J. McCloy. Wben Werner Von Braun refused to work for the American space program without his former army boss, General Walter Domberger - who had in the meantime been sentenced by the war crimes tribunals to be bung - it was McCloy who stepped in and granted Dornberger a full pardon. 43 In fact, McCloy pardoned over seventy thousand Nazis accused of war crimes. 44 Perhaps this is not surprising, since McCloy was a \"lawyer in the employ of LG.

Once in the U.S., the Nazi scientists were, of course, watcbed closely .... but not, it seems, too closely.

To ensure its continued survival and the survival of its projects and agenda, Kennedy had to go. 4. The William Lyne Version AIso at the bizarre end of the spectrum of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis is the version of New Mexico author and conspiriologist William Lyne, who outlines his version in three books, Pelllagon Aliens (formerly entitled Space Aliens ji-OI11 the Pelllagon), Occult Ether Physics, and Occult Science Dictatorship. Many dismiss his work, simply because of an abundance of very bizarre and oftentimes outlandish assertions, while overlooking some significant insights and hints that also characterize his works, oftentimes sandwiched between assertions that either repeat the standard \"Nazi Legend\" of the UFO or of \"Hitler Survival\" while liberally adding new elements. For example, Lyne asserts - without any substantiation - that Adolfand Eva Hitler not only survived the war, but were flown out of Germany in a flying saucer piloted by the famous German £ilot Hanna Reitsch and German Luftwaffe ace Hans Ulrich Rudel! 9 As if that were not enough, he adds that they lived happily ever after in Kassel, Germany, protected by a secret NATO agreement,50 and that on the invitation of President Lyndon Johnson, visited the San Antonio World's Fair in Texas,s' where later, apparently, Adolf, exercising as ever his attraction to art, and lovely wife Eva visited a west Texas art show where Lyne happened to be sitting sketching pictures! And Lyne leaves no detail to chance, for he even 49 \\Villiam Lyne, Pentagon Aliens (Lamy, New Mexico: Creatopia Productions, 1999), p. 49. so Ibid. \" Ibid. 81"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"\"From Russia with Love\" describes the visit by burly security personnel, combing through the art show booths, prior to the arrival of the Fuhrer!

For example, Lyne also asserts that During the war, Gennan scientists bypassed development of the \"atom bomb\", and buill and tested the neutron bomb. German field Marshall (sic) Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Karps were originally sent to North Africa to test the neutron bomb, as well as Tesla's \"death ray\" (which freezes whole armies); this technology was acquired by American corporations, held chiefly by David Rockefeller, and was later sold in part back lo the U.S. government and tested in the '60s, and lhe same technology was again sold to the U.S. government in the '70s and '80s as \"Star Wars\"(\"SD!\" or \"Strategic Defense Initiative Technology.\"\" While the assertion sounds wild and fantastic, and indeed, your author does not believe any neutron bomb was ever tested by the Nazis in Africa or elsewhere, in fairness to Lyne it should be recalled that the alleged Ohrdruf test of a nuclear device that took place on March 4, 1945,S3 was of a device with a small critical mass, an event that - if it indeed happened - could only have occurred via the process of \"boosted fission,\" whereby a neutron- emitting source is added to the critical mass assembly, allowing more neutrons into the initial chain reaction and accordingly a lower critical mass. This is one step away, in a certain sense, from the neutron bomb. Likewise it should be pointed out that when Lyne's assertion was ftrst made in July 1993 in the ftrst printing of Pentagon Aliens (under its former title Space Aliens from the Pentagon) the allegations of the Ohrduf test and other German nuclear tests during the war were just beginning to surface, making it unlikely that Lyne based his assertion on these German sources. \" Ibid\" PI', 48-49, emphasis added. \"See my Reich of the Black Sun, PI'. 80-88, 82"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell Lyne's assertions do not end there, however. He adds even more anecdotal detail to the mix: (When) prisoners from Rommel's Afrika Korps were brought to Roswell, New Mexico (!) they carried some rather strange post cards apparently printed by Rommel's field lithographers, showing New York City being destroyed by a mushroom cloud. The camp commandant, Dave Dunn, who later became an engineer with Union Oil Company of California in their Midland, Texas Office, and who prepared the U.S.G.S. for President John F. Kennedy in 1962, thought these were humorous, and showed me one he had saved as a souvenir. The fact was, however, that Rommel's main mission in the Libyan desert, was testing the neutron bomb. The post cards carried by his troops were a 'morale builder', which superimposed the photolithograph of the mushroom cloud of the bomb they had actually tested and photographed, over a photolithograph of New York City, in a composite. The claims by Manhattan Project members, that they built the first ATOM bomb - from German plans - was true. Einstein had brought the stolen plans to us with the firm belief Ihat we would use the A-bomb on Germany. Since the Allies had already succeeded in obtaining the Gennan plans for be A~bomb, Werner Heisenberg merely sidestepped the A-bomb, and built the N-homb.

For example, Lyne claims that David Dunn found the postcard of New York City being a-bombed (or n-bombed), \"humorous.\" One has difficulty jmagining how any rational human, much less an American, could find such a postcard humorous. This detail casts a pall of dubiousness once again over the whole passage, as does the assertion that any a-bomb plans existed at the time Einstein emigrated from Germany to the USA, much less that Einstein actually managed to steal them from the security- and Jew-obsessed Nazis. Yet, in these bizarre assertions, Lyne is also clearly insinuating a connection between Nazi science, its actual accomplishments, and the Manhattan Project, and all that again in a book published prior to that of Meyer, Mehner, or Friedrich Georg in Germany, or Carter Hydrick in the USA, works ~4 William Lyne l Pentagon Aliens. p. 99. 83"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"\" From Russia with Love\" which are heavily referenced and researched, and by no means the merely \"anecdotal\" character ofLyne's Pentagon A/iens.

Red mercury is mercury antimony oxide, specially prepared by irradiation and pressured into a gel to increase its density to create the necessary precondition for a neutron explosion. A small quantity of it can then be used as a nuclear trigger/igniter to detonate a small amount of heavy hydrogen producing the deadly neutrons for a 'clean bomb. ,\" 1n February, 1992, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signed Directive No 75-RPS, authorizing Preomekologia, a Russian company headed by Yeltsin's ecological advisor, to \"manufacture, purchase, store, transport I deliver, and sell for rubles and foreign currency\" 'red mercury' in amounts up to ten tons per year. The order was rescinded a year later because of criticism within Russia of export of such a \"valuable raw material\", In a spring, 2004 documentary on Britain's Channel Four (\"Britisb PBS\"), a Russian nuclear chemist confirmed be bad worked with red mercury since 1965, that it is currently produced in a factory in the central Russian town of Ekaterinburg, and that fusion \\\\o'eapons have been made in Russia from it.

The Russians allegedly developed it as a means of detonating bydrogen bombs without the need for an a-bomb, thus creating a \"clean\" hydrogen bomb, still capable of taking out large cities in an enormous explosion, but leaving a much smaller radiation fallout signature, '6 Lyne, Pentagon Aliens, pp. 99-100. 84"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"rhe SS Brotherhood of the Bell Again, one encounters Lyne's typical mixture of the seemingly outlandish and bizarre with actual fact, for indeed, Dr. Sam Cohen, the inventor of the neutron bomb, did express such fears and reservations concerning red mercury, while other scientists loudly dismissed the substance and its reputed ability to initiate thermonuclear fusion as a complete hoax. And the substance does resemble a mysterious substance also used in The BeII. S ? As was seen, Lyne ends his \"red mercury\" foray with another fantastic claim, that during World War Two the Germans managed to manufacture plutonium of great purity, an assertion that calls into question the Allied Legend in a very direct way, since to manufacture plutonium of any purity one must first possess a functioning nuclear reactor, which the Gennans were not supposed to have achieved during the war. But again, one cannot be too hasty in dismissing his assertion, for as was detailed in my previous book Reich of the Black Sun, the alleged azi test of an a-bomb in 1945 at Ohrdruf was of a high yield device of a critical mass of no more than 100 grams, a fact which, if true, is only possible with very pure plutonium and boostedfission. That is to say, Lyne once again has made a claim that, oddly, has been paralleled by similar and subsequent allegations originating from post-reunification Germany, and the much more substantial research of German researchers who, in addition to citing anecdotal stories from elderly witnesses or relatives of witnesses, also seek to corroborate their stories by documentation or other means. Lyne's tail of a neutron bomb test thus also begins to pry open the door to his version of the Two Space Program Hypothesis, for it clearly indicates that one primary element is what the Nazis actually accomplished versus what we have been told that they accomplished. Yet another primary aspect of Lyne's version of the Hypothesis also emerges from this strange account, and that is the secret development of a science and technology otherwise suppressed. And this brings us, at last, to Lyne's version of the Hypothesis itself. There are three aspects to his version: (I) Public Consumption Relativistic Physics Versus Occulted Aether Physics, \" See chapter four of [he present book, as well as Reich of lhe Black Sun, p. 335. 85"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"\"From Russia with Love\" (2) The National Security Act and Scientific Suppression, and (3) The Role of azis in the above. a. Public Consumption Versus Occulted Aether Physics Lyne outlines his case for an occulted physics and technology in a series of clearly stated and provocative questions, and then an equally clear and provocative answer: Ls it possible that an entire area of physics has been declared virtually \"occult\" and \"off-limits\" to tbe public or to private individuals, by a powerful group, so that aLL science education or data generally availabLe to the public has been \"screened\" to eliminate references to it? Is it possible that the actual science involved in \"electro-propulsion\", has been replaced with a \"bogus science\", which has been promoted and promulgated to the extent that no one except the 'esoteric elite' knows the truth? And if so, has the \"occult\" science become the exclusive province of a very few specially selected corporate/government \"priests\"? ..... The high priests of this occult knowledge are the eLite owners of the coercive monopolist corporate banking, industrial, mineral and related interests, who in tum allow the initiation of certain scientists, military and government officials into their secret teaching only insofar as it is necessary, to execute and maintain a conspiracy of giant proportions, so that the technology can be classified as a \"stale secret\" which can be controlled and enforced by means of unconstitutionaL \"national security laws\", military and civilian legal authority, and poLice. These measures are intended to protect the archaic technology and resources controlled by the elite, from the competition of a truLy free market society.58 Note the insinuation that the national security apparatus of any nation is involved in this conspiracy. We shall return to this aspect of Lyne's version of the Hypothesis in a moment. For Lyne, the suppression of \"occulted aether physics\" requires a program consisting of two central elements: (1) the suppression of exotic physics that at one time or another entered the public record, regardless of how obscure the record or how limited the \" William Lyne, OCCIIII Elher Phsyics: Tesla's Hidden Space Propll/sion Syslem and the Conspiracy la Conceal It(Lamy, New Mexico: Creatopia Productions, 2003), pp. 1-2. 86"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell public may have been. As will be seen in a moment, this includes various tactics to make it difficult to reconstruct the suppressed physics. (2) The second element is the creation of an alternative version of physics for \"public consumption\" or as Lyne puts it - also clearly delineating where he thinks the blame lies for the dead end of physics in the 20the century - giving the public \"relativistic bromides\" packed with exotic phrases like \"the 'fabric' of'space- time'\" and \"frame-dragging,\" all of which, he says, suggest the idea of what \"they\" wish to suppress, namely \"the existence of an ether (sic, et passim),59\" even though that aether is an erroneously conceived \"relativistic\" aether. 60 The reason is deceptively simple: \"'Ether Physics', by its very nature and name, is subatomic physics.,,61 Relativistic physics, on the other hand, is the physics of the very large. And as numerous physics texts and popularizations have reiterated countless times, the quest of physics since relativity and the advent of quantum mechanics has been to somehow squeeze the two theories together. So much for the second element; it is clear that Lyne believes Einstein's relativity theories to be a crucial component of the creation of a \"public consumption physics,\" a physics guaranteed to dead-end. But what of the first element? How does one suppress things that are already part of the public record, even if that record is for a relatively small public, such as the professional community of scientists or scientific historians? Lyne's answer to this question is hidden in his - for once - well-documented though brief history of the aether, and it is worth citing his remarks at length: Atler some difficulty, I accessed a copy oflhe classic, A HisIOIJ' of the Theories of the Aether and Electricity. by Sir Edmund Whittaker (1951 revised and enlarged second edition, Vols. I and II). The 1910 first edilion of this book was probably the most comprehensive book ever published on ether theory as it existed in 1910, but the 1951 revision merely clarified \"acceptable\" ether physics. The first edition was printed in Scotland, under tbe title A History of the Theories of Ihe 59 Over the next few pages the spelling ofhaether\" varies.

The second edition incorporated \"new material\" related to quantum mechanics. Classical theory was in Vol. I, while Vols. II and II gave the origins of relativity and quantum theory up to 1926. Neither the 1910 first edition nor the 1951 revision mentioned Tesla, but the chronological sequence appeared to be \"skewered\" in the revised edition, with little or flO attempt to point ollt what the scietlliS1S were actually aiming ot.... 62 That is, two effective tactics in suppression of the public record are simply to scramble the chronological sequence of, and delete the practical motivations behind, the theory in question. A third tactic is evident in a later remark: Though it was said by Whittaker that the Hall Effect, like the magnetic rotation of light, occurs only in ponderahle hodies and not in lhe \"free ether\", this statement was patently false, since the effect actually depends on the conductivity of a medium. This was a definite lie Ofl Whittaker's part, prabably \"required\" ullder the /95/ revisioll. The fact that the effecl occurs in \"ponderahle bodies\" and \"conduclive media\" however, is all-important for electropropulsion, since it shows the reaction hetween such bodies and media and the underlying \"etheric framework\" which is accessed in the process. 63 In other words, when all else fails, simply lie, or leave out part of the truth. Note also that Lyne is clearly implying that Whittaker was \"required\" to do so, i.e., that some pressure was exerted on him. This fact will become much more significant, since one of Whittaker's early 1903 papers was one of the founding papers of \"scalar\" physics, a non-linear form of aether physics, as we shall see in a subsequent chapter. Whittaker and the two editions of his classic history of the aether is thus a pivotal though (to the general public) still largely unknown figure in the story. At any rate, Lyne concludes that \"Whittaker's 1951 edition intentionally skewered important facts concerning electropulsion ....

Accordingly, this section will perhaps seem somewhat long and perhaps a bit technical. Nevertheless, it is essential to Lyne's argumentation that Tesla was an aether physicist par excellence 65 As Lyne puts it, \"It was my intent to examine known theory leading lip to Tesla, to see what he contributed to their discoveries, and to determine what happened since that time to obscure, misinterpret and ultimately conceal il.',66 Central to this reconstruction is the work of 19 th century physicist J.J. Thomson, discoverer of the electron. Thomson had theorized, based on Maxwell's earlier theory - that a charged spherical conductor moving in a straight line must produce displacement current in the medium (Phit. Mag. Xi (1881), p. 229). In 1893, twelve years later. he claimed to have discovered \"electromagnetic momentum\", saying •.... in an electromagnetic field there is stored in every unit volume an amount of mechanical momentum, proportional to the vector product of the electric and magnetic vectors.\" (J.J. Thomson, Recent Researches ill Electricity and Magnetism [ 1893), p. 13.) Thomson also was said to have developed the theory of moving tubes of forces - which harked back to Faraday's earlier work - saying in 1891 that molecular strllcn\"e is closely connected with tubes of electrostatic forces, with magnetism regarded as a secondary force. He sUlted that ..... the aether itself is the vehicle of '\" Lyne, Occult Ether Physics, p. 30, emphasis added. \"Electropulsion\" is Lyne's aptly coined tenn for propulsion methods relying on electrical charge differentials. 65 This much is certainly true, as any examination of Tesla's writings will demonstrate. What is unique in Lyne's interpretation is the driving and unifying motivation that he claims to detect in Tesla'5 work. As we shall see, Lyne argues his case well. 66 Lyne, op. cit .. p. 30. 89"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"\"From Russia with Love\" mechanical momentum, of amount (1/4 \" C) [D-B] per unit volume.\" (Phil.

And this, claims Lyne, is the single unifying factor of much 19 lh and early 20 th century experimentation. 68 But chronologically and empirically, this makes no sense, as Lyne points out, and with this next observation, the central figure of his version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis arrives on the scene: Nicola Tesla: J.1. Thomson's theory, which linked electromagnetism with momentum in a mathematical and unified way, on paper, somewhat repeated Tesla's earlier lecture of 1891, proven by his earlier experiments, but Tesla's theory was different from Thomson's whose theory was incorrect. Thomson's electromagnetic momentum could be created instantaneously only with Tesla's contrivances, which existed before Thomson's \"discovery\", only in Tesla's laboratory, so there is no way that Thomson could have reduced \"his\" theory to practice or experimentally verified it. fR Equally important to Lyne's argument that electrical momentum and propulsion was a central unifying motivation to the scientific pursuits of the 19 lh century, was the work of another Thomson, this time William Thomson (Lord Kelvin).7o ., Lyne, Occliit Ether Physics, p. 31. 68 See Lyne, OcclIlr E,her Physics, pp. 48-66. See especially the imponant remark Lyne makes on p. 58, in the context of the discussion of Tom Bearden's views on \"scalar\" or \"quantum potential\" physics in chapter five. Lyne states \"There was already a son of hattie brewing between the proponents of classical electrodynamics, and the proponents led by Maxwell of an electromagnetic theory of light. To the former, conductivity occurred in metal wires, etc., while with Maxwell. it occurred in the surrounding dielectrics and ether-filled space, with the conductors serving only to 'guide' the action. \" (Emphasis added). This is ro say that electrical circuits are not closed systems but open systems, and act as local \"structurers\" and transducers of the medium and its energy, a view well in keeping with Bearden's insights . • 9 Ihid .. , pp. 31-32, bold emphasis L.yne's, italicized emphasis added. 70 For the sake of clarity, J will refer to William Thomson as Lord Kelvin, so as not to confuse him in the reader's mind with 1.1.

(Kelvin) found that ponderomotive forces act between two solid bodies immersed in an incompressible fluid, when one of the bodies is immobilized and made to oscillate with a force which acts along a line between its center and that of a much larger sphere which is free. The free sphere was allracted to the small (immobilized) sphere, if its density was greater than the fluid, while a sphere of less density than the fluid was repelled or allracted, according to the ratio of its distance 10 the vibrator in relation to a certain quantity.74 Lord Kelvin's experiments were expanded upon by C.A.

Bjerknes showed that when two spheres immersed in an incompressible fluid were pulsated, they exerted a mutual allraction which obeyed NewlOn's inverse square law if the pulsations were in phase, while if the phases differed by a half wave, the spheres repelled.

Citing an article in the September 22, 1940 edition of the New York Times by William L. Laurence, Lyne notes that Tesla claimed to have discovered a new force which he called the \"teleforce.\" Expanding on his famous Colorado Springs experiments, Tesla explored this force in discoveries and experiments between 1900 and J 940, claiming to have found a new way to create waves in the atmosphere, a '''new' way to create a 'very great electrical force,''' as well as a new way to magnify that force, and a new means of electrical propulsion 84 Indeed, Tesla had maintained this vision of an electrical flying machine since the I870s, when it first occurred \" Ibid. 82 Ibid., p. 25. 83 Ibid. \" Lyne, OcclII, Elher Physics, p. 27. 93"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"\"From Russia with Love\" to him as a student.

In a lecture in 1938, Testa stated that the central theory of all the above five elements - his \"dynamic theory of gravity\" - had been worked out by 1893. 86 In that lecture, Tesla referred to two significant discoveries that he planned to \"give to the world\" when he had completed \"his secret developments. ,,87 Those two discoveries, according to Lyne, were the Dynamic Theory of Gravity and idea of \"environmental energy,\" i.e., the idea that \"there is no energy in matter other than that received from the . ,,88 environment. Lest Tesla's assertions be thought to be merely quirky restatements of relativity, it must be remembered that Tesla considered his theory wholly inconsisteot with the theory of relativity, and with the modem theory concerning the structure of the atom and the mutual interconversion of matter and energy_ Tesla continuously attacked the validity of Einstein's work; and until two or three years before his death he ridiculed the belief that energy could be obtained from matter. 89 In a certain sense this is due to Tesla's habit of thinking in terms of nineteenth century aether physics, but in another, it is due to the nature of the discoveries he was making since his Colorado Springs experiments, discoveries that took him into the most avante garde areas.

The first was a dynamic theory of gravity, which I have worked out in all details and hope 10 give 10 the world very soon. It explains the causes of this force and the motions of heavenly bodies under its influence so satisfactorily that it will put an end to idle speculation and false conceptions, as that of curved space ....

What Tesla is in effeci saying through his (always) carefully chosen language is that in any electrical circuit or conductor, it is not so much the power \"source\" that produces the power, but rather that such a source, along with the parameters of the circuit itself, is an open system transducing power from the medium.

Tesla wrote an unpublished article toward the end of his life called \"Man's Greatest Achievement,\" in which he states some very unusual, very new, and, as it turns out, very 01d,9J views of the aether: Long ago (man) recognized that all perceptible matter comcs from a primary substance, or a tenuity beyond conception, filling all space, the Akasa or lumeniferous ether, which is acted upon by the life-giving Prana or creative force, calling into existence, in never ending cycles, all things and phenomena. The primary substance, thrown into infinitesimal whirls of prodigious velocity, becomes gross matter; the force subsiding, the motion ceases and matter disappears, reverting to the primary substance. Can Man control this grandest, most awe-inspiring of all process in nature? ... Ifhe could do this, he would have powers almost unlimited and supernatural .... He could alter the size of this planet, control its seasons, guide it along any patb he might choose ... He could cause planets to collide and produce suns and stars ...

But what does all this mean? Here, it is best to cite Lyne's catalogue of Tesla's own statements, followed by Lyne's own summary of their implications. Lyne assembles a series of quotations by Tesla to demonstrate eight points: 1. \"The most probable medium filling space is one consisting of independent carriers immersed in un insulating fluid.\" 2. \"In his experiments he dwells first 011 some phenomena produced by electrostatic force, which he considers in the light of modern theories to be the most important force in nature for us to investigate.\" 3. ·'He illustrates how mechanical motions arc produced by a varying electrostatic force acting through a gaseous medium,\" 4. \"One of the most interesting results arrived at in pursuing these experiments, is the demonstration of the fact that a gaseous medium upon which vibration is impressed by rapid changes of electrostatic potential, is rigid.\" 5. \"'fthrough this medium enonnous electrostatic stresses are assumed to act. which vary rapidly in intensity, it would allow the motion of a body through it, yet it would be rigid and clastic, although the fluid itself might be devoid of these properties.\" 6. ·· ... on the assumption that the independent carriers are of any configuration such that the fluid resistance to motion in one direction is greater than in another. a stress of that nature would cause the carriers to arrange themselves in groups. since they 9S Tesla also shows himself quite familiar in this quotation with ancient metaphysical and esoteric doctrines of the materia prima with his reference to Akasa, or the Akashic field, a kind of eternal epbemeral \"Hall of Records.\" 96 Lyne.

Indeed, by discovering the twin characteristics of the aether as longitudinal compression and rarefaction, as well as vorticular motion, Tesla laid the foundations of \"scalar physics\" as we shall see when we examine the work of Tom Bearden. Tesla actually went so far as to discover the \"endothermic explosion\" (cold explosion) uses of such wave phenomena: Tesla discovered that by using a low frequency beam-directed pulse, he could cause, at the quarter wavelength. the eruption of a large electromagnetic pulse which CQuld, by carrying a much higher exciting wave, excite the atmospheric gases in a region, to explosively expand them, followed by a tremendous implosion and the absorption of a great amount of heat in the area, causing immediate freezing.

From what has been stated, it is obvious that Lyne views Tesla's theoretical and practical work as a prototypical \"unified physics\" that can develop a technology with a variety of applications, from propulsion to weaponry of planet-busting potential. b. The National Security Act and Scientific Suppression Tesla's post-Colorado Springs discoveries were deemed \"not fit for public consumption.\" And this required, of course, an entity to coordinate and monitor the suppression of such physics and to coordinate any further secret development of it, to promulgate a \"public\" version of physics destined to proffer untestable theories publicly while privately developing entirely different paradigms, and to coordinate the secret development of exotic physics and associated technologies. That entity Lyne believes was created, or perhaps better put, was sanctioned by the National Security Act of 1947. To corroborate this, Lyne observes that Tesla's contemporary, friend, and biographer, John J. O'Niell, who wrote the classic biography Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla, attempted no less than three times to publish the book, all in the same month! Lyne quips: radioactivity as environmental and hence a dynamic phenomenon, and not as an \"inherent\" property of certain types of unstable malter.

'''' Tesla, contrary to government disinformation, was a careful note taker. As Lyne puts it, \"the notes on his Colorado Springs experiments alone were enough for a large-format book of 433 pages.\"J05 And over his entire lifetime, Tesla managed to produce more than a railroad boxcar full of material, most of which was con.fiscated by the FBI on his death, as only 150,000 documents were released to his Serbian relations in Yugoslavia.'06 (1) Strange Nazi Parallels At this juncture Lyne's version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis begins to take its fmal shape. Lyne states that after the arrival of Von Braun and other Project Paperclip scientists in the US after the world war, the military-intelligence community from Air Technical Command at \"Wright-Patterson Air Force Base hurried up to the warehouses of the Custodian of Alien Properties, and took possession of all the Tesla materials. They removed them to Wright-Patterson, and every bit of them have been classified at the highest level ever since, the government having declassi.fied NONE of them.\"'O?

Similarly, and for our purposes, more importantly, Lyne points out the obvious fact that since such Nazi documentation as concerned itself with such exotic physics, weapons and propulsion systems was confiscated by America (or, equally plausible, remained under German control or at least influence), then the so- called \"plans\" and \"documents\" of the SS supposedly detailing Nazi flying saucers are also fakes, part of an elaborate dis information campaign.llo But oddly, and most chillingly, Lyne points out that the two largest and most notorious agencies established by the ational Security Act, The Central Intelligence Agency and The National Security Agency, are but direct English translations or metaphrases of Reichsicherheilhauptamt, the infamous R.S.H.A, which may be literally translated as \"National Security Agency\" and loosely also connotes a central, or main, clearing office, or \"central intelligence\" or \"security\" agencylll 108 William Lyne, Pentagon Aliens, p. vii.

Thus, Lyne maintains that before the war, Werner Von Braun and a small and select team of German scientists went to New Mexico and there performed preliminary experiments on Tesla's ideas, a project Lyne calls the \"p2\" project, after Tesla's two different potentials. 112 Having assured themselves of the viability of Tesla's science, Lyne asserts that Von Braun and company returned to Germany where the work was continued in great secrecy and behind a number of \"camouflage\" black projects, such as rockets and \"aerodynamic saucers.\" The cover-up continued after the war under the aegis of the National Security Act and the Nazi- influenced CIA, which had taken over the whole of German military intelligence on the Eastern Front, General Reinhard Gehlen's Fremde Heere Osl (Foreign Armies East).

Both Feet In Atlantis: the \"Jan Van Helsing\" Version On the decidedly bizarre end of the Two Space Programs spectrum are the curious allegations of the pseudonymous \"Jan Van Helsing,\" a researcher into the occult basis of exotic Nazi technology. Like the other pseudonymous source \"William Torbitt\" examined previously, Van Helsing outlines a scenario of a coordinated \"private\" group of secret societies behind the Nazis pursuing exotic weapons technologies. Unlike Torbitt, however, Van Helsing also displays evident sympathy for some of these societies and by implication for the Nazis themselves. Nonetheless, Van Helsing's allegations are too important to be ignored. Van Helsing published his views in a work entitled Secret Societies: Their Power and Influence in the Twentieth Century, a work not easily available except in an excerpted version on the internet. 114 Van Helsing repeats many of the themes of the Nazi UFO Legend, including those that place the beginning of Nazi secret weapons research in very secret pre-war projects of these secret societies, namely, the so-called \"Vril Gesellschaft,\" named after the \"vril\" or aetheric energy of Sir Edward Bullwer-Lytton's famous novels of a long-lost subterranean civilization that had 114 Q.v. www.galactic-server.netJrune/vrill.html. 104"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell preserved the secrets of tbis mysterious energy, and the more famous or infamous Thule Gesellschaft, the secret society that actually helped to midwife the Nazi Party into existence. These ideas are nothing new in the lore of the Nazi UFO legend. What is new with Van Helsing are the odd details that he adds to the mix. For example, Van Helsing states that the Vril Society \"was mainly occupied with tbe building of UFOs. They bad, next to Viktor Scbauberger and Dr. W. O. Schumann, also Schriever, Habermohl, Miethe, Epp and Belluzo working for them.,,115 ]n other words, Van Helsing makes the astonishing claim that all of the alleged \"flying saucer experts\" that were associated with the development of these exotic technologies since Rudolf Lusar first broke the story in the 1950s were members initially of a secret society whose primary purpose was the building of such craft. All the Nazis did, apparently, was to continue the project under their own occult-inspired jurisdiction: the SS. But beyond this, Van Helsing also makes two other assertions with this remarkable statement, one very blatant, and the other only implied. ]n the first case, he baldly asserts that world-renowned scientist and physicist W.O. Schumann, discoverer of the so-called \"Schumann Resonance\" of the earth, was himself an initiate into this society, and was cooperating on these projects. In the second case, Van Helsing is clearly implying by his unsubstantiated allegation that some group inside Germany was involved in the secret development of an \"off-the-books\" physics and technology long before the Nazis came to power. In this, his allegations are similar to those who believe that the 1890s \"airship\" flaps in the USA were brought about by a secret group that had covertly designed, perfected, tested, and flown the first \"airships\". Were these the only allegations that Van Helsing makes, it would be fairly easy to simply dismiss them with a smile and a chuckle, and move on. However, Van Helsing also couples his allegations to the known occult doctrines of these secret societies as the pril71G1y motivation behind the Nazi projects, and in so doing, proposes his own \"Nazi\" version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis. The importance of his allegations lies, 1\\5 Jan Van Helsing, Secret Societies: Their Power and influence in the Twentieth Cemwy. www.galactic-server.net/rune/vrill.hrml. p. 1. 105"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":".. From Russia with Lovell therefore, in its odd corroboration of Richard Hoagland's belief that many NASA launches and mission \"logos\" were coordinated in reference to occult doctrine and practice, particularly to celestial alignments. This strange history begins, according to Van Helsing, in 1917, during World War One, when The occultist BARO RUDOLF VON SEBOTTENDORFF. the Gurdjeff (sic) disciple KARL HAUSHOFER. the ace pilot LOTHAR WAIZ, PRELATE GERNOT of the secret \"Societas Templi Marcioni\" (The Inheritors of the Knights Templar) and MARIA ORSIC. a transcendental medium from Zagreb met in Vienna. They all had extensively studied the \"Golden Dawn\", its teachings. riLuals and especially ils knowledge about Asian secret lodges. Sebollendorff and Haushofer were experienced travelers of India and Tibet and much influenced by the teachings and myths of those places. During Lhe First World War Karl Haushofer had made contacts with one of the most innuential secret societies of Asia, the Tibetan Yellow Hats (dGe-lugs- pal. This sect was formed in 1409 by the Buddhist reformer Tsong-kha- pa. Haushofer was initiated and swore to commit suicide should his mission fail. The contacts between Haushofer and the Yellow Hats led in the T\\\\lenties to the fonnation of Tibetan colonies in Germany. The four young people hoped that during these meetings in Vienna they would learn something about the secret revolutionary texts of the Knights Templar and also about the secret fraternity DIE HERREN VOM SCHWARZEN STEIN (\"The Lords of the Black Stone,,).\"6 Again, there is, on the surface. nothing new about Van Helsing's allegations; one encounters the familiar names - Von Sebottendorff and General Haushofer, Hitler's \"geopolitics\" guru- in connection with familiar themes: the fascination for the Orient and for its \"secret wisdom\". But, again, Van Helsing imparts new information - again without the slightest substantiation - that is unique to him, namely, that the Vienna meeting was for a twofold purpose: (I) to acquire knowledge about some apparently (very) secret Templar texts, and (2) to acquire knowledge about an even more secret fraternity, the Lords of the Black Stone. And of course, lest it be forgotten, the words Black Stone, in German, are schwarzen Stein, abbreviated as 116 Jan Van Helsing, Secret Societies: Their Power and lnjluellce in the Twentieth Century. p. 1, w\\vw.galactic-scrver.neUrune/vril3.html. 106"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The SS Brother/wod of the Bell \"5S\". lt is not long, therefore, before Van Helsing couples this new twist to another ancient occult doctrine, the \"Black Sun\" (schwarze Sonne) of illumination, also abbreviated \"5S.,,1 17 Then in September of 1917, Baron Von Sebottendorff allegedly met with leaders and members of this mysterious \"Lords of the Black Stone\" fraternity in \"Untersberg to receive the power of the 'Black-Purple Stone' after which the secret society was named.,,118 Again, no substantiation or evidence of this assertion is offered. However, perhaps a very indirect corroboration exists in the form of the famous traveler-explorer-occultist Nicholas Roerich, an advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roerich, of course, had a similar preoccupation with \"magic stones\", namely, the celebrated chintimanti stone of Mongolia. In any case, whatever happened in September 1917 appeared to have been successful, for in 1918 a group formed around Von Sebottendorff in Bad Aibling, which would become the notorious Thule Society. [t is here that \"scientific magic, astrology, occultism and Templar knowledge as well as 'Golden Dawn' practices like Tantra, Yoga and Eastern meditation\" were all combined.,,1 19 And among this potent mix was also a tincture of messianism, for the Thule Gesellschaji also \"believed, following the Revelation ofIsis, in a Coming Saviour (German: Heiland = the Holy One), the 'Third Sargon' who would bring to Germany glory and a new Aryan culture.,,120 In other words, the program was a total one: the goal of the secret society not only continued to be to (re-)discover and (re- )construct a lost and exotic technology of hegemony, but it also sought to place its ideas and agendas into power. Once in power, it would maintain itself in authority by the very technological means it was seeking to (re-) discover.

Second, it provides a similar context from which to view the allegations of some that Hess was privy to whatever secrets that expedition found, and that these were the ultimate motivation for the Allied Powers keeping him - or his imposter - imprisoned for so long after the war. Finally, it provides an interesting context from which to view the Third Reich and its secret weapons black projects themselves, projects which included a heavy admixture of occult doctrine and experimentation. From a glance at the list, it is apparent that the SS itself is the visible extension of the Thule Gesellschafl into the Third Reich. Or, to put it differently, via the National Socialist Party, an occult secret society had seized the reigns of authority in one of the world's great powers, and could thus direct the entire energies of that state into the overt and covert pursuit of its agendas. Among the doctrines held by the Thule Gesellschafl that lay behind the Nazi ideology were an \"Ayro-Gennanic construction of religion ... by the philosopher Guido Von List... a leaning towards the anti-Old Testament\" views of an early Christian heresy known as Marcionism, 122 This was augmented by the \"esoteric history\" of the Aryans believed by the Thule Gesellschaft, a history reconstructed from ancient Gennan and Scandinavian myths.

Further expeditions searched in the Andes, the Matto Grosso mountains in the North and the Santa Catarina mountains in the South of Brazil, in Czechoslovakia and parts of England.,,125 As Van Helsing also mentions, Hitler's geopolitician, General Karl Haushofer, had his own personal dualistic twist to this doctrine, claiming that Thule was actually Atlantis and - contrary to all other researchers of Tibet and India - he said that the surviving Thule-Atlanteans were separated into two groups, a good one and an evi lone. Those who called themselves after their oracle Agharli - were the good and settled in the Himalaya region, the evil ones were the Shamballah - who wanted to suhjugate humanity and they went West.

But secondly, as the remarks immediately above make clear, his interest is not so much these allegations, but rather that they led to the development of an entirely different technology and science by a secret society founded for the purpose by the very man later to be Hitler's geopolitician! As if that were not enough, Van Helsing then goes on to make the following statement: During this early phase of \"aIJemative science\" Dr. W. O. Schumann of the Technical University in Munich. both a Thule and a Vril member, held a speech a section of which is reproduced here: \"In everything we recognize two principles that detennine the events: light and darkness, good and evil, creation and destnlction - as in electricity we know plus and minus.

For example, he alleges that this machine was tested for two years before it was \"dismantled and probably stored in the Augsburg works of Messerschmitt.,,14o Moreover, there were entries in the financial records of German aviation companies \"under the codename 'JFM' (for Jenseitsjlugmaschine)\" that showed \"payments towards financing this work.\" 141 But it is when Van Helsing arrives at World War Two and the continuation of these projects under the Nazis that his fantasia knows no hounds. For example, he alleges that \"at the beginning of 1943 it was planned to build in the Zeppelin works a cigar-shaped mother ship,\" a machine called the \"Andromeda Device\", with a length of around 150 yards, capable of storing \"several saucer- shaped craft in its body for flights of long duration,',142 or perhaps better stated, flights of Adamski-esque imagination. But immediately after these sensational and highly questionable allegations, Van Helsing again comes up with more unsubstantiated specifics: By Christmas 1943 an important meeting of the Vril Gesellschaft took place at the seaside port of Kolberg. The two mediums Maria Orsic and Sigrun anended. The main item on the agenda was lhe Aldebaran Project. The mediums had received precise information about habitable planets around Ihe sun Aldebaran and one began to plan a trip there.

Here Van Helsing is on more solid ground, for there was indeed such a group in the SS, whose top secret brief was precisely to research \"alternative energy.\" But Van Helsing adds his customary occult twist, for he calls this group \"Development Group IV of the Black Sun,\" or Schwarze Sonne, abbreviated \"SS\". The doctrine of the Black Sun (Schwarze Sonne) or Black Stone (Schwarze Stein) was the secret doctrine of the SS known only to Himmler's highest SS generals.

Percy and Mary Bellllelt are correct, then not only were the Two Space Programs that were begun by the Nazis during the war continued ajier the war both by the Soviet Union and the United States, they moreover exhibited much more coordination between them than the space programs of alleged rivals should really exhibit, especially at the height of the Cold War where the ultimate prize - the Moon - promised rich benefits in prestige and military position to whomever got there first. 6. The Dark Moon Version British authors David S. Percy and Mary Belll1elt are the latest in a long line of researchers who question the historical record of the Apollo manned Moon missions. This is not to say that they are of the typical \"Apollo-was-entirely-hoaxed\" genre. Quite the contrary. As they put their own case, the purpose of their book, Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistleblowers, is \"to question the entire validity of the official record of mankind's exploration of the Moon especially the Apollo lunar landings. We are not however claiming that astronauts from Earth have never walked on the Moon.,,147 That is to say, they believe mankind went to the Moon, but that it did not happen in the way we have been told it happened. 147 Mary Bennett and David S.

Like many others, they cite the usual discrepancies in lighting, varying angles of shadows within single frames, light sources from areas supposedly in shadow, and so on. Unlike many others, they do not cite these anomalies as proof that we never went, but only to raise questions about the official version of the way we went. And the Two Space Programs Hypothesis is crucial to their reconstruction of what they believe actually happened. On tbeir view, the Two Space Program Hypothesis takes on the following outline: • The foundations for the grand space project were laid down during WWII. • The project was conceived and designed as a collaboration between two superpowers. • The Cold War was a convenient cover under which aspects of this project could be implemented and hidden. • All these machinations were orchestrated at the very highest level, with only a select and hidden few ever knowing the overall objectives of the project. • These objectives have not yet been achieved in full. We are referring to a project that has been around at least since 1947 - and it divides into several sections. • Put another way, NASA's Apollo pbase, seen by the public to be the end result of a decision made in the 1960s by President Kennedy was in fact only a small (bUI significant) part of a greater plan. • \\Vhatever humanity has experienced concerning the rivalries between lhe super powers of this world, today, at some very high but invisible level, our ani tudes are being molded to suit an agenda which does not necessarily have all our interests at heart. 148 What is of interest here is the clear connection of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis to the famous events of 1947 - Kenneth Arnold's first \"UFO\" sighting in Washington state and the later even more famous \"Roswell incident\" with all its attendant 148 Mary Bennen and David S.

In this respect, Bennett and Percy are unique. Moreover, they repeatedly hint at a Nazi connection, or at least, impliea/ion to their approach, for \"without the remnants of Hitler's war machine, our first steps into space would probably have occurred decades later.,,149 According to Bennett and Percy, the deceptions that became so much a part of the public policy of NASA - deceptions already noted in this chapter in connections with other versions of the hypothesis - were already in place well before the agency had even been established. The policy decisions leading to these deceptions began, as they point out, in the \"pre- and post-war period in Germany.,,150 The deceptions originate, in fact, with a deliberately muddied picture of Operation Paperclip. As Bennett and Percy quip: Now follows some interesting arithmeric. We are told by (David) Baker that the Gennan scientists began arriving at Fort Bliss in October 1945 (that is the advance guard of Von Braun and his small team of five) and by March 1946 their numbers had peaked - at the grant total of thirty nine. (Paperclip scientists) Stuhlinger and Ordway infonn us that there were three shipments and a IOlal of 1/8 men arriving in America between November 1945 and February 1946. So by 1946 the American Army have already lost 85 scientists. Were they declared AWOL or were they housed elsewhere, and not at Fort Bliss? \\\\fere some of them at Ahnogordo perhaps? From 127 total German rocket scientists allowed into America under Operation Paperclip we have a IOtal of 6 + 118~4.'\" But their suspicions predate even Operation Paperclip and the inability of the historical record to come up with anything like a consistent number of GenTIan scientists and technicians actually brought to the USA. The Two Space Programs may have actually begun, at least on the Allied side of things, during the war itself. In evidence of this allegation, Percy and Bennett proffer the R.A.F's massive 600 bomber raid against the Peenemlinde facility ill 1943. 149 Ibid., p. 165. IlO Ibid. \"' Mary Bennell and David S.

From nine minutes past midnight on August 18 and over forty seven minutes, 600, yes six hundred, Royal Air Force aircraft marked targets and then dropped 1,593 tons of high explosives and 281 tons of incendiary bombs onto PeenemHnde. However, from the beginning the start point of the bombing run was altogether mis-identified - the northern pcninsular (sic) of Peenemunde being lit by the target indicators rather than the designated Ruden Island situated two miles further north. As a result of this initial 'blunder', the air raid failed in two-thirds of its avowed objectives .... Instructions from the highest level, it seems, had been to target personnel and certainly not the V-2 rocket production facilities. 152 Indeed, even in targeting personnel the raid was not much of a success, since \"of the eight hundred personnel on the ground who did die about half were from the prisoner labor force (mostly Soviets) and the other half were technicians and tbeir families.\"t5> The important scientists - Kurt Debus, Werner von Braun, Hermann Oberth et al - survived. So this raises the specter of a last minute change in the operational plan of the raid, a change effected at the highest level.

After careful consideration of the various accounts, Bennett and Percy concluded tbat both the Soviets and Americans arrived at the notorious Mittelwerk - the underground factory for building V-2s using concentration camp slave labor, constructed by SS General Kammler- at the same time and moreover cooperated in divvying up the booty! 155 Such glaring discrepancies Most certainly uphold our theory that this entire period was being organized as a cohesive whole and was not just a 'race' against time to see who could bag the bigger haul of documents, materials and men. This plan was surely a precursor to the ·space race' story, which was also designed to look like one thing but actually to function in a completely different way.'56 While the USA was shipping a few hundreds of German scientists to the USA, along with Von Braun and the precious documents he brought with him, the Soviet Union rounded up over three thousand technicians who had worked on the rockets, and whose new job for their new Soviet masters \"was to re-establish the documentation taken by von Braun.,,157 It was a convenient division of the spoils. And perhaps a bit too convenient. Bennett and Percy point out that in 1958 a British publisher, Robert Maxwell, attended symposia in Moscow for the international geophysical year. While there, Maxwell returned to his hotel room one day with a sixty three page manuscript containing what were supposedly \"book titles\" and asked his wife to photograph the pages quickly, as the papers absolutely had to be returned before lunch. His wife recounts how by page thirty two she noticed thaI they were not book titles at all, but were \"Die deutschen Firma, deren Einrichtung demontiert lind zur Ausflihr nach der Sowjetunion bestimmt sind.\" Which translates as: \"German finns whose equipment is to be dismantled and transported to the Sovier Union.\" ...

We shall see in a moment how this idea actually - and most curiously - is able to explain and unite the various versions of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis. Bennett and Percy's version of the Hypothesis now reaches its [mal and full development. Noting that the Soviet Union began to return these Gennan technicians in three drafts, beginning in 1952, and ending in 1954 when the last of the technicians were repatriated to Germany, they make clear one crucial difference between the Soviet Union's use of Nazi scientists, and the American one. In the Soviet Union these technicians were principally employed teaching Russian university students, which students in tum gained practical hands-on experience by working in the Russian space program while they were still sll/denls. /59 In this one may detect the steady hand of Sergei Korolev, as well as appreciate the reason for the early Soviet successes in space achievement. The Soviets at least appeared to be serious about freeing their program from undue Nazi influence as quickly as possible. And this brings us, finally, to Bennett's and Percy's version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis: Most conveniently, at the end of WWlI the political globe had been divided into two - one 'public sector' in the West and one private sector in the East. What could be more simple than to exploit this division and lower the iron curtain in exactly the same way as the safety curtain comes down in the theatre. This ruse enabled the organizers of the space project to go to work in relative obscurity. I n the sense that two teams were targeting the Moon there was always a space race. In reality the objectives were not those of competition. These two teams, while wearing different colours, were in truth on the same side. And even if many of the key players were unaware of the real script, it is likely (in our view) that at least both Korolev and von Braun were aware of the true situation. l60 '\" Ibid.

Indeed, as they point out, control of these two programs was vested in no more than \"a few score men\" who also \"controlled the services of some of civilization's most highly trained specialists\" and \"the large funds appropriated for armaments.\"161 But to assert that the two superpowers' space programs were carefully contrived along \"public\" and \"private\" lines is to suggest a degree of coordination between them that hitherto was hardly ever seriously suggested. However, this, Bennett and Percy urge, is precisely what the record seems to indicate. \"The American/Soviet space timetable demonstrates how carefully progress in space had been shared between them, with alternating monthly flights in some cases.

Moreover, \"this awareness of ET was the driving force behind their mission to land on the Moon.

While not offering much to substantiate this astounding assertion, they do offer a couple of clues, namely, that in addition to a public and private consumption space program, there was also a public and private consumption physics that accompanied the two programs. First, they note that during the era when both superpowers were still conducting atmospheric tests of hydrogen bombs, these tests curiously produced auroral displays in the opposite hemisphere from that in which the detonation took place. That is, hydrogen bombs are partially harmonic devices. l66 Very little is ever publicly discussed in physics texts about this phenomenon. The question is: why? 163 Mary Bennett and David S.

There is a significant phenomenon concerning the alleged outward journey to the Mooo during 'Apollo I I' which has to our knowledge never been elaborated upon, explained, or indeed mentioned in relation to any of the suhsequent Apollo 'trips' - a phenomenon which may have assumed giganlic proportions for NASA and the space scientific community. So much so that (as far as we can tell) it has been 'locked down' in an attempt to sweep any discussion or knowledge of it under the carpel. To what are we referring? It is the neutral point, which is also called the equigravisphere. This location is just what it says it is: • The point between two planetary bodies where the gravitational 'pulls' between the two bodies cancel each other out. • Once this point is space is passed, a craft is no longer affected by the gravity of the planetary body which it (is) leaving but is now progressively under the influence of the planetary body towards which it (is) moving.'·' The \"Neutral Point Discrepancy\" is one of the glaring features of the Apollo programs and their published data, and it raises a number of very important questions. It was Sir Isaac Newton who had first calculated the Earth- Moon neutral point using his theory of gravitation. That theory gave him an average Earth-Moon distance of 238,900 miles, and the neutral Eoint thus occurred at approximately 23,900 miles from the Moon. l 8 This of course gave the now familiar figure that the Moon's gravitational attraction was about 1/6'h that of the Earth. But then came a 1969 edition of Time magazine, an interview with Werner Von Braun himself, and the beginning of a persisting mathematical mystery concerning the Earth-Moon dual planetary system. Time reported that \"43,495 miles from the Moon lunar gravity exerted a force equal to the gravity of the Earth, then some 200,000 miles distant.\" And that, note Percy and Bennett, \"gave a '.7 Mary Bennett and David S.

The difficulties that this poses - which Bennett and Percy never adequately address - will be seen in a moment. In any case, Bennett and Percy note that a mere two weeks after the Time magazine article, Werner Von Braun quite suddenly resigned all his NASA posts and took a position as Vice President of Engineering for Fairchild Industries, leading them to ask a question many other researchers have asked in regard to the Neutral point Discrepancy: \"Could that Time magazine article ... have anything to do with Wernher von Braun's somewhat hasty departure for pastures new?\",70 It is my opinion that it definitely did, and the possible reasons - once again - will be seen in a moment. Whatever else the Time article may have done for the space science community, at the minimum it began, according to Bennett and Percy, a process of \"arithmetical obfuscation\" that can only be seen as deliberate, since to view what happened next as not being deliberate would be akin to charging NASA with gross mathematical incompetence. For example, in the 1981 edition of Baker's Space Technology the Apollo II distance to the Moon is given as 253,475 miles. But in 1989 the book Apollo JJ Moon Landing gave the distance as just under 250,400 miles. Then in 1996, Baker's Spacejligh/ and Rocketry gave the neutral point as 38,925 miles from the Moon and 214,550 miles from Earth, giving a total distance to the Moon of 253,475 miles. Then, to really complicate matters, George Pinter assured authors Bennett and Percy that the neutral point really was exactly what Von Braun told Time magazine, namely, 43,495 miles. 17J Yet, prior to the Time article, and according \"to the majority of references\" the old Newtonian figure was still being used to calculate the neutral point. 172 169 Ibid., p. 393. 170 Ibid., p. 394. 111 Mary Bennett and David S. Percy, Dark Moon, p. 393. 172 Ibid., p. 392. 125"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The question is of prime importance, since either figure for the neutral point gives very different gravities for the Moon, and consequently, very different trajectories for any craft going there, and, more importantly, very differentJuel and thrust requirements for any rocket-powered craft lifting off from the lunar surface, such as the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module). Obviously, this also raises a significant set of questions. \"Is it not interesting,\" Bennett and Percy ask, \"that no sources agree on the exact distance of the Moon's orbital path?,,173 Moreover, in order to trajectory any craft to the Moon, both NASA and the Soviets would have had to know this average distance \"to the last inch,'. So why is it so difficult for NASA to confirm some set figure? \"Why is the Earth/Moon centre-to-centre distance missing from the published Apollo information? Where one can find the craft's trajectory, the Earth/Moon distance is often missing or vague. Where one can locate the Earth/Moon distance, the craft's trajectory is often missing or vague.\"t74 To confound matters even further, \"space experts at NASA or elsewhere, do not state whether they are using planetary surface-to-surface or centre-to-centre measurements. Nor do they always state whether they are using nautical miles or statute miles. Nor do they stick to anyone system.,,175 In short, \"the only consistency in the Earth/Moon measurement scenario is the inconsistency of the data emanatingji-om official sources. ,,176 Percy and Bennett's way out of this impasse is to posit that the 23,900 mile figure - the Newtonian figure - is correct, and that the figure revealed by Von Braun to Time magazine is the \"experienced\" neutral point. Their reasons for doing so are plain: NASA and the Soviets used the Moon's 1/60 as part of the calculations for their successful slingshot manoeuvres around the Moon and also for the calculations relating to energy requirements for their crash lander and soft lander probes, including those that actually returned samples to the then Soviet Union. If the evaluation of the lunar gravity had been 173 Ibid., p. 391. '74 Ibid. 17' Mary Bennen and David S.

It hardly stands to reason that Von Braun was \"resigned\" from NASA for having made a whopping mistake in his interview to Time. Nor does it stand to reason that he was \"resigned\" from NASA for having deliberately lied to Time. The only scenario that makes sense is that he was forced to resign because he revealed something that he should not have. If one assumes that the 43,495 mile neutral point was accurate and not merely an \"experienced\" neutral point as Bennett and Percy would have it, then this raises a number of significant points: I. This neutral point calculation was clearly made much earlier in both the Soviet and American space programs than it was publicly revealed by Von Braun. If, as Bennett and Percy state, the Newtonian figure had been used for early probes, these would have either crashed into the Moon or careened off into space. Telemetry data would have eventually given scientists a correct neutral point calculation. 2. But this raises a new question. For the above scenario to have occurred, then probes would have had to have been launched to the Moon much earlier than the public record shows. The question thus is, when was the 43,495 mile neutral point figure actually known, and who discovered it? 3. The Time magazine neutral point also raises another signal difficulty, and that is that with a neutral point of 43,495 miles, the gravity of the Moon would be a whopping 60% that of the Earth! 178 As Bennett and Percy rightly point out, this dramatically increases the energy, and hence the fuel, requirements for any craft landing on the Moon's surface and subsequently taking off again from it. 177 lbid., p. 395. 178 This neutral point figure raises another difficulty. one to which I averred in my book The Giza Death Scar, pp. 2l9-220. 127"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"\"From Russia with Love\" 4. This in tum raises a significant question regarding the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) of the Apollo missions, the craft that actually landed on and then blasted off from the surface of the Moon. Many researchers have pointed out that the LEM has little blast signature from a rocket when it is taking off from the Moon to return the astronauts to the command module. This, so many say, is evidence of a hoaxed Moon shot. I do not believe this explanation to be plausible or credible. For one thing, a rocket exhaust in a vacuum leaves little visible plume. But what the lack of blast signature may also indicate, I believe, is that the rocket was not the primary lift component of the LEM. In other words, if - and it is a very considerable if - the gravity of the Moon is considerably higher than the public has been told, then this would account not only for the unusually \"heavy\" movements of the astronauts while on the Moon, but also would tend to indicate that the primary lift component of the LEM was not a chemical rocket at all, but another fonn of technology altogether. And that means a secret technology, and a significant aspect of the space program that is also secret, In other words, Von Braun had let something slip, something whose significance, if followed through to its logical conclusion, pointed not so much to the Apollo missions as having been hoaxed, but as having occurred by means of a science and technology vastly different from the public version. Von Braun's remark plus the lack of much of a rocket blast from the LEMs when lifting off from the Moon may indicate the existence of an off the books planetary science - the Moon's actual versus its publicly-stated gravity - and an off the books technology.

Conclusions and Speculations A glance at the basic features of the several versions of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis is now in order: 128"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Tire SS Brotlrer/lOod of tire Bell I. The Torbitt Version has the following features: (a) A worldwide network of dummy corporations exists to further and protect big oil intercsts. These entities are a literal \"Murder Incorporated\" since they are not above using assassination and other illegal methods to protect their interests; (b) This network is intertwined with a network of Eastern European emigre communities, which are in turn mostly the creatures of Gennan military intelligence on the Eastern Front during World War Two, and were thus directly answerable to General Reinhard Gehlen and possibly his successors; (c) These business and emigre networks are intertwined with the American intelligence community via the FBI, CIA, and NASA security via the organization known as the Defense Industrial Security Command (orSC) under the direction of Werner Von Braun; (d) By implicating Von Braun, the Torbitt Document implicates the wider Nazi connections associated with the Gehlenorg and with Operation Paperclip, though the motivations for Nazi involvement in the Kennedy assassination are never clearly spelled out. One is left to surmise that at some level the policies of the Kennedy Administration threatened some hidden technological and/or policy agenda of the space program. 2. The Hidden Planetmy Geology, Climatology, and Archaeology Version: (a) In any version - the \"absurdist\" or the more plausible models of Hoagland and others - the common feature is that NASA (and by implication the Soviets) know of artifacts 011 the Moon and Mars, relics of a long-lost technologically sophisticated civilization; (b) NASA and associated agencies have suppressed this information, or, when it is already available to the public, has attempted to sway publ ic opinion to the view that such 129"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"\"From Russia with Love\" photographic evidence is either a \"trick of light and shadow\" or artifacts of faulty computer image enhancement and processing; (c) At the same time, NASA has released deliberately tampered photographs and otber data to mask possible artifacts on the Moon and Mars and any evidence that might indicate contemporaty life forms on Mars; (d) NASA further shows repeated evidence of having scheduled launches for significant missions on dates and times that possess astrological and occult significance, and moreover has consistently employed Masonic and other esoteric symbolism in its mission logos. This in turn suggests a hidden space program or agenda is being manipulated and planned around occult lines. It should be stressed that all of the above points are stated only with regard to the American space program, and are not made of the Soviet space program l79 3. Jim Keith's Casebook on Alternative Three Version has the following characteristics: (a) The actual television \"documentary\" and the book by the same name, Alternative 3, are elaborate pranks and hoaxes; (b) Nonetheless, the broad outlines of the scenario probably contain some truths; (c) The USA and USSR have conducted a highly secret joint space program coordinated by some unknown entity; (d) The USA's intelligence community was deeply penetrated in a classic \"Trojan Horse\" operation by General Gehlen's Fremde Heere Ost, subsequently known as the Gehlenorg, under the guise of \"fighting Communism\"; the Gehlenorg maintained extensive human intelligence networks in 179 To my knowledge, no such \"occult\" or \"esoteric\" analysis of Soviet launches, such as what Hoagland has undertaken for NASA, has ever been made.

Tn the context of the overall argument of his book, it seems clear that Keith had in mind that this entity had some ties to the postwar \"Nazi International.\" 4. The William Lyne Version: For our purposes, Lyne's version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis is significant for three reasons: (a) Lyne deliberately connects the covert suppression of alternative physics and its secret development to Nikola Tesla whose ideas, he maintains, were subsequently taken up by the Nazis, expanded upon, and developed. In Lyne's view, the secret suppression and development of this technology is directly linked to facets of Nazi ideology that favor \"corporate fascism\"; (b) In Lyne's view, this covert development of \"Tesla technology\" concerns mostly the development of new energy and propulsion sources and technologies that make the \"public consumption\" technology of space exploration by chemical rockets entirely obsolete; (c) This covert \"corporate-fascist\" development of alternative technology was begun by the Nazis before the war and continued by them - under various corporate and U.S. Government agency sponsors - a fier the war. 131"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"nFrom Russia with Love\" 5. The Jan Van He/sing Version contains perhaps the most interesting - if unsubstantiated - features: (a) German research into exotic physics and propulsion systems began long before World War Two under the direct inspiration and auspices of various secret societies; (b) These societies in tum held doctrines that were later to become part of the ideology and belief system of the Nazi Party, among them the doctrine of racial purity, and the extra-terrestrial origin of the \"Aryan\" race; (c) Similarly, these societies maintained that this race and its high culture had \"sunk\" or disappeared beneath the earth in vast subterranean cities under the poles and the Himalayas; (d) These societies in tum helped midwife tbe Nazi Party into existence, and their most hidden doctrines - The \"Black Stone\" and the \"Black Sun\" - became tbe hidden doctrines of the upper echelon of the SS, which also continued tbeir research into exotic physics. 6. The Dark Moon Version: The Dark Moon version is in many ways the most subtle of the versions, with the exception of Richard Hoagland's, for authors Mary Bennet and David Percy are far from maintaining that there were no Apollo moon landings. They question, rather, the details of the record and the technological and political implications that those details seem to suggest: (a) Central to one of their arguments is the Neutral Point Discrepancy between tbe Earth and the Moon. As has been seen, Bennett and Percy use this discrepancy to argue - in my opinion erroneously - for an \"alternative physics\". While the Neutral Point Discrepancy does point in that direction, I believe that it may be taken as a significant indicator that what Von Braun let slip in his Time magazine interview was in fact a piece of information that implied tbe existence of a very advanced technology of propulsion in 132"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) in addition to - or perhaps in place of - its conventional rockets. The existence of such a technology points to the existence of a coven space program; (b) In Bennett and Percy's version, the two space programs of the USA and USSR in fact represent the public and covert aspects, respectively, of one program being coordinated and manipulated behind the \"public consumption events\" of the Cold War. This of course implies some entity or agency of coordination existing both within the Soviet Union and the United States; (c) In their version this coordination was planned during World War Two, implying that the Nazis and their space scientists were somehow linked to, or were identical to, the hidden agency coordinating the Two Space Programs after World War Two and during the Cold War. 7. Combining The Versions: If one now combines the common features of these various versions of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis a rather interesting picture begins to emerge. (a) Two of the versions - Lyne's and \"van Helsing's\" - maintain that the origin of the Two Space Programs occurred before the war, and that both of them occurred in conjunction with independent entities conducting exotic research; (b) Two of the versions - Hoagland's and \"Van Helsing's\" (!) - maintain that some aspect of the hidden program and agenda is dominated by occult and esoteric themes; (c) Two of the versions - Jim Keith's and \"William Torbitt's\" - connect this hidden space program to a carefully hidden and extensive Nazi network of intelligence agents and scientists, and imply a \"Trojan Horse\" deep penetration of the post-war American intelligence, military-industrial, and aerospace communities; 133"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"\"From Russia with Love u (d) All of the versions either explicitly or implicitly imply the existence of an off-the-books development of a new technology and an underlying framework in a theoretical physics that is very different from that found in texts \"for public consumption;\" (e) One version - Lyne's - explicitly offers a \"hidden history\" of physics to buttress its claims, offering an interpretation of some ofTesla's late work; (f) One version - Hoagland's - also explicitly states that there is a new type of \"hyperdimensional physics\" connected with the discovery of artifacts on Mars; (g) One version - Bennett and Percy's - explicitly states that there was a covert element of cooperation between the USA and USSR in early space exploration, though it does not clearly name the entity for coordinating such cooperation; (h) One version - again Bennett and Percy's - also suggests an element of suppressed physics and planetary mechanics by exploring the problems surrounding the Earth/Moon system's Neutral Point Discrepancy, and this implies the possibility that an alternative and secret propulsion technology may have existed in the L.E.M.(Lunar Excursion Module). Viewed in this way it is clear that no matter how one approaches the data, there does appear to be a solid case that much more was and is afoot in the American and Russian space programs than has been publicly revealed. Additionally, it seems clear that at least some of this hidden component involves the planetary physics that has been carefully hidden from the public, or, when that fails, the data so hopelessly obfuscated that any mathematical or physical calculation becomes problematic, since it is dependent on the already obfuscated data released by the space agencies. This also implies the prospect that at some level there may exist a hidden technology at work. The television footage of the LEM takeoffs from the Moon, which this author believes to be genuine and /lot hoaxed, suggest one of two things: first, the 134"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell standard explanation: a rocket lift-off from a low gravity surface, with a barely visible flame plume because of the vacuum. Or it may represent the possibility of the existence of an exotic propulsion technology. The relative lack of an exhaust plume, plus the almost steady rate of ascent might point to the existence of a very di fferent means of gelling off the moon than we have been told. 8. Possible Entities and Requisites Jor Coordination This picture raises yet another significant question: What entity or entities would be capable oj coordinating such a massive venture and such an equally massive \"public relations\" campaign, including the suppression of alternative science and technologies and their covert development? If one excluded a high-level and very top secret diplomatic collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union at least in the version of Bennett and Percy, then that still would not explain the other versions of the Hypothesis, those of Hoagland, Lyne, or those who maintain NASA has suppressed significant facts about planetary geography. So, if one views these various versions as somehow related, as disparate glimpses of the same two-track space program, again, what entity could possibly coordinate it all? To answer that question, one must assume that such an entity have certain features: I. Adequate financial power and backing; 2. An international base and extension both inside the West and the Soviet bloc; 3. Adequate penetration at various decision-making levels in the USA's and USSR's space programs (and anyone else's that might come along); 4. An ideological and heavy financial commitment to the development of off-the-books technologies; 5. A thorough knowledge of the occult, ceremonial magic, and astrology, and the demonstrated willingness to schedule space missions according to those occult parameters; 135"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"\"From Russia with Love\"' 6. An ideological commitment to the exploration and military exploitation of space; and finally, 7. A willingness to resort to and the ability to use \"active measures\" to coerce compliance to its goals when necessary. Seen in this way, there really are only four possible entities in the world that posses various combinations of the above, and only one of them possesses all of them: I. International banking and finance; this group lacks only a clear and consistent connection with number 5 above. That is, a consistent, demonstrable, and significant correlation to occult activity and practice; 180 2. International ji-aternities, such as the Masons; this group lacks only numbers 2 and 3 above, since the extent of its activities behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War is largely unknown; 3. The Vatican; certainly not lacking in international extent, financial power or knowledge of esoteric doctrines, this entity obviously lacks only numbers 6 and 7 above; 4. The Nazi International; this is the only entity that exhibits significant measures of possession of all the above characteristics, though it should be pointed out that the Soviets repatriated most German scientists by 1954, and that the KGB was - as far as is known - relatively successful in infiltrating the Gehlenorg's Eastern European networks and shutting many of them down. 181 Nonetheless, the heavy reliance of the Soviet program initially does raise the remote prospect that recruiting may have been done by 180 It does not lack a clear connection to Nazism either before, during, or after the war, as will be seen in a subsequent chapter. 181 It goes without saying that not much at all is known of Germany's Blindesnachrichtendienst. It alone, of all the major intelligence agencies of the world, unlike the Israeli Mossad, the Soviet KGB, the British MI·6, the French Slirete or even Chinese intelligence, has had next to nothing written about its successes and/or failures, other than General Gehlen's own memoirs. 136"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Tire 55 Brotlrerlrood of tire Bell the expatriate Germans while working inside the Soviet Union.

A means of corroborating this hypothesis will be to see if there is any indication that wartime research begun by the Nazis was continued by them for a period after the war, and to see if this research was carried out in apparent conjunction either with the US or with USSR's space programs, or in conjunction with both. But if there are l\\\\fO space programs and if there is a suppressed physics and technology, all of which dating from the Second World War and in some sense stemming from it, then what might that physics and technology be?

Igor Witkowski on the Bell It is due to the research efforts of Polish military journalist Igor Witkowski, and the best-selling book by British author Nick Cook, The HUllt for Zero Point, that anything at all is known of the Bell. And until the publication of Witkowski's The Truth About the WundenvajJe, Nick Cook's book was the only book in the English language that contained any information at all on the Bell, summarizing Witkowski's years' of investigation 2 With the publication of Witkowski's research in English, however, one is in a position to see why the Bell was given the Third Reich's highest c1assi fication. Indeed, one can see why some may have resorted to a program of murder to protect its secrets. To appreciate this object's true significance, however, it is necessary to understand what it was, what it did, what the physics behind it may have been, and, thereby, what the Germans were possibly hoping to achieve with it. We will begin with a survey of I Igor Witkowski, The Trw\" About the WundenvajJe, translated from the Polish by Bruce Wenham, (Farnborough. England: Books [nternational and European History Press, 2003) p. 284. - It should be pointed out that Geoffrey Brooks' book, Hiller's Terror Weapons, also contains information about the Bell.

The Significance of the Story of the Bell Before proceeding to summarize Witkowski's lengthy and weighty research in his chapter on the Bell from his book on German secret weapons, The Truth About the WunderwaJJe, a word is necessary about its significance. As is well known to UFOlogists, the \"Nazi Legend\" of UFO origins has been around since the end of the Second World War and the publication afterward of Major Rudolf Lusar's book on German secret weapons, where the first brief mention is made of the subject, accompanied by the first \"schematic\" of an alleged \"suction-type\" German saucer. As many have pointed out, the story rests on few sources, which, when traced back, seem to lead nowhere, except to those sources' own questionable connections, associations, and agendas. With Witkowski's research on the Bell, however, one has something entirely different. The story is significantly different from the stories surrounding the \"Nazi legend\" and its familiar names of Habermol, Miethe, Schriever, Epp, Schauberger and so on. With the Bell story, one has, as will be seen, clear descriptions of its design, mode of operation. and eJJects. as well as clear indications of known personnel involved with the project and clear corroborative evidence in the form of installations and residual physical signatures. To put it succinctly, the story of the Bell is the actual probable basis of the Nazi UFO legend. 2. An Obvious Question and a Not So Obvious Answer For Witkowski, the investigation all began in August of 1997, when he was asked a very obvious question, a question that in fact hovers over every author who has ever investigated the mystery of wartime Nazi secret weapons research: Just exactly what was the 142"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood o/tile Bell so-called \"Wonder Weapon\", or WUlldenvafJe? For Witkowski, the journey began when a Polish intelligence officer, who had access to Polish government documents regarding Nazi secret weapons, first made him aware of the Bell. Among other things he asked me if I had ever come into contact with a device developed by the Germans. which was code-named \"the Bell\", and made a sketch of it. On a circular base was some kind of bell jar. cylindrical in shape with a semicircular cap and hook, or some other clamping device at the top. The Bell jar was supposed to be made of a ceramic material, resembling a high voltage insulalOT. Two metal cylinders or drums were located inside.) Nothing about the description of the object aroused any interest in Witkowski, but he could not let the subject drop, since the individual who had approached him impressed him with his knowledge. \"This was no amateur living in a dream world. Of that I was sure.'''' But what had really piqued Witkowski's interest were the individual's descriptions of the Bell's \"quite simply unearthly effects\" when it was in operation, effects that conjured in Witkowski's mind the final scene from Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark, effects that were \"absolutely shocking.\"s This description, plus the man's evident sincerity and expertise, made the question he asked Witkowski even more significant: (He) asked me the outright disamling yet seemingly trivial question: if I was able to state with full responsibility that the \"Wunderwaffe\" - that \"wonder weapon\", was the V-lor V-2, as was often mentioned. If in any German documents or in any original sources in general, I had come across information unraveling what the \"Wunderwaffe\" was. He stated that after all it could not have referred to the V-lor V-2, since firstly these weapons had been from a military point of view 110t very effective (and therefore not \"wonder\") and secondly that the term \"Wullderwaffe\" had begun to appear in earnest already ajier the \"V\" Weapons had been deployed in combat. This .... vas indeed intriguing. Later from the point of view of this, I looked over various volumes 3 Witkowski, Tile T nlth AboUi the WIlndenvoffe. p. 23 I . , Ibid. , Ibid. 143"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"\"Das Laternentriigerprojekt\" from my library and in actual fact it appeared that some kind of unusual weapon had existed, practically unknown till this day' In other words, Witkowski had come across one component of the Allied Legend - that the WundelwafJe referred to the V -I, V-2 and various other rocket projects of Nazi Germany - and to nothing more. But the historical record suggested otherwise, as Witkowski notes; the term WundelWafJe clearly began to be applied by the azis to something that was not any kind of rocket, even if that something was only a figment of Dr. Giibbels' Propaganda Ministry. But tbe uniqueness of the Bell and the revelations of tbe intelligence man continued to preoccupy Witkowski: My aforementioned informer strongly emphasized that what was involved was a uniquely classified project, lite most secret research project ever realized in lhe Third Reich! Therefore it is surely clear that regardless of the scale of difficulty it was worth verifying such a statement.' In other words, beyond atom bombs, hydrogen bombs, fuel air bombs, advanced rockets, stealth materials, guided missiles, sound cannon, wind and vortex cannon, electromagnetic railguns, laser beams, nuclear powered aircraft, and all the other exotic weapons technology the Nazis were developing, there was one project so important in its scope and terrible promjse that it - as will soon be seen - merited its own unique classification, and that project was the Bell. Witkowski began to research the story, and uncovered what is perhaps the most important story to come out of World War Two. 3. The Personnel and a New SS Player on the Scene: the Forschungen, Entwicklungen, Patente When Witkowski was able to assemble at least a partial list of scientists and military personnel involved witb tbe project, a very odd picture emerged.

This cell was designated \"FEP·'. which was an abbreviation of the words \"Forschungen. Entwicklungen, Patente\" - research. development work, patents. The chief of this \"FEP\" cell was a certain Admiral Rhein. while the described project was co-ordinated by a quite mysterious individual - namely SS-Obergruppenfiihrer (Four Star General) Emil Mazuw. Why mysterious? Simply because despite possessing one of the highest general's ranks in the SS. practically nothing is known about him. I got hold of his dossier in the USA in 1999, but through this he became in my eyes an even morc obscure figure. It followed both from his dossier as well as cards from the course of his service, that Mazuw had been at the very top of the SS elite. I-Ie was promoted to the rank of SS Obergruppenfiihrer on 20 April 1942, in other words he had possessed the highest possible SS rank at that time (in 1944 the SS OberstgruppenfUhrer rank was further established, four people being promoted to it). He was awarded with the Honorary saber of ReichsfUhrer SS (Ehrendengen des RFSS) and honorary SS ring with skull and cross-bones (SS Totenkopfring). Such a ring was given by Himmler for special service to the organization. Their bearers constituted the highest caste of SS-men. given admittance to the greatest secrets. Each ring was personally dedicated by Himmler .... Mazuw already had it in 1936. He was therefore one of the powers behind the throne of the Third Reich, almost unknown to this day' What is interesting here in the light of my own, and other's, previous research into the secret weapons think tank of SS Ober- gruppell/iihrer Hans Kammler's, is that the Bell project appears to be under the mysterious \"F.E.P.\", which in turn is under an 8 Witkowski, The Truth About the WlIlldenvajJe, pp. 236-237, emphasis Witkowski's. 145"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"\"Das Lalernentriigerprojekt U Admiral, implying a Kriegsmarine connection with whatever exotic technology and physics the Bell represented.

But this may only be an apparent contradiction. At the rarefied levels of 5S Obergruppenfiihrers, contact between Mazuw and Kammler - both involved in sensitive black projects - would have been inevitable. And we know for certain that Kammler himself was in charge of Bormann's special evacuation command at the end of the war, the command which it appears successfully evacuated the Bell from Lower Silesia via a Junkers 390, about which more in a moment. But what of Witkowski 's statement that he knew of no direct or known association of Mazuw with the SS' \"occult bureau\", the Ahnenerbedienst? The answer, as in Kammler's case, must be speculative. However, given that, at its highest level, Himmler intended for his SS to be a kind of \"black knights of the round table\", and given that his chosen twelve \"black knights\" with access to the \"SS occult center\" at the castle of Wewelsburg had to be of at least Grllppenfiihrer (general) rank, then again, it would seem unlikely that Mazuw did not know of the SS' occult activities and interests.

Did he, like KammJer, disappear into the bowels of some Allied country's post-war classified projects or perhaps - an equal possibility - simply disappear, to continue the project independently? And the presence of a navy Admiral in the parent organization, the F.E.P., raises a further question: why the indirect connection to the German navy? Does this relationship perhaps indicate something about the nature of the Bell itself'J b. Prof Dr Walther Gerlach Unlike Emil Mazuw, Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach was and is quite famous, and for any number of reasons. As Nick Cook noted in his Hunt for Zero Point, Gerlach was a Nobel laureate for his work in spin polarization. A first class physicist, Gerlach went on to specialize in gravitational physics, on the basis of his pioneering experiment 12 that earned him the Nobel prize. But as any researcher of the German atom bomb project knows, Gerlach was also nominally the head of atom bomb research in Nazi Germany by war's end, and was one of the scientists interred by the British at Farm Hall in England, where the scientists' conversations were secretly recorded. Gerlach was also expert in two other obscure topics, both of which, as we shall see, are closely associated with the Bell: the transmutation of elements, and the \"fluorescence of mercury ions in a strong magnetic field, in other words, referring to the behaviour of mercuric plasma.\" Gerlach had evidently been involved in the topic \"for a long time, because as far back as January 1925 he wrote to Arnold Sommerfeld about the spin ... of 12 The Stem-Gerlach experiment. This experiment, along with Einstein's experiment on the photo-electric effect which earned him the Nobel prize. and the well-known Michelson-Morley experiment, are perhaps three of the most important experiments in the development of modern physics. 148"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell ionized mercury.\" In such matters, Gerlach was \"faultlessly well- informed.\"I] Even more mysteriously, Gerlach, one of the world's premier gravitational physicists before the war, never returned to the subject after the war. Nick Cook comments in his well-known book The Hum for Zero Point that Gerlach thus acted as if \"something had scared him beyond all reason.,,14 While Cook meant his comment in a speculative sense, there is perhaps some truth to it. If he was genuinely frightened, and if this is the reason for his curious post-war silence about spin polarization and gravitation, then this could be due to two causes. First, as the lead scientist involved with the Bell project, and as a loyal Nazi, Gerlach would have been privy to the curious and strange results of the Bell's operation and possibly have even personally witnessed some of these effects. As we shall see, these effects would have frightened any rational human. So, one explanation - the one that seems to be implied by Nick Cook, in fact - is that Gerlach saw or wilnessed something in the very project he headed that had frightened him into post-war silence. But there is a second, and r think, more plausible explanation for Gerlach's apparent fright-into-silence. Indeed, it is an explanation that would seem to give a factual basis to Cook's speculation that Gerlach was \"frightened\" into post-war silence on these admittedly esoteric topics. As Cook himself notes, following Witkowski's research, the SS shol the sixty-some scientists and their assistants who worked on the project, rather than let any of them fall into Allied or Russian hands. IS As we shall see, there appear to be only a few scientists, two of them well-known in their way, that survived the SS' massacre: one was Kurt Debus (about whom more below), and the other was Walther Gerlach. This allows us to undertake something of a reconstruction, speculative though it will have to be.

That this is the most rational conclusion is evident from the fact that if the SS bad bargained with the Allies or Soviets to exchange this project in return for their lives, then the process would be self-defeating, if the Soviets or Allies were denied the very technicians tbat made the project possible. Such scientists and technicians would have been in the Soviet's or Allies' \"intelligence targets acquisitions and booty\" list, so to speak. By its actions, in other words, the SS is clearly signaling that it has no intention of letting the project fall into Soviet hands, and it is equally possible that it has no intention of letting it fall into Allied hands either. 16 So why did Gerlach and Debus escape? They escaped simply because of their sheer notoriety and value to the project. 17 For the SS to have murdered these men, and dumped them unceremoniously into an unmarked mass grave in Silesia, would have inevitably attracted Allied and Russian interest. ..... and questions, after the war.

Gerlach, in particular, was the theoretician, capable of fortllulating the \"big picture\" of whatever it was the Nazis had discovered with the Bell. Such men would be needed ajier the war if the project were to be continued and advanced. Indeed, as will be seen later in this chapter, it may have been Gerlach or someone in his close circle of friends and associates in the physics community, that initiated the Bell project. So what frightened Gerlach? Very simply: perhaps the SS \"allowed\" Gerlach and Debus - and any other big name scientist that might have been involved with the project - to witness the executions of their comrades. Or perhaps the SS communicated their fates to Debus and Gerlach in some other fashion. In either case, the message was clear: \"keep quiet on this subject, and keep cooperating.\" If that was the message to the two men, then it certainly worked, for Gerlach never even intimated in the Farm Hall Transcripts of his involvement with any project during the war that involved his specialty: gravitation. IS And as for Kurt Debus, he apparently never mentioned the more exotic technologies to his new employer after the war, as we shall see below. [n any case, I believe the SS murders of the Bell's scientists are the best explanation for Nick Cook's observation that Gerlach never touched the subject of spin polarization and gravity after the war, acting as if \"something had scared him beyond all reason.\" 18 \\Vitkowski does mention Ihm according to his sources, Gerlach did speak a great deal in the Fann Hall Transcripts about magnetic fields, a10mic nuclei. the earth's gravitation, and \"extraterrestrial space.\" (The Trwh AboUl the Wrmdenvaffe. p. 255). If this is true thcn it puts a whole other perspective on the classification of the Fann Hall Transcripts and why they remained classified for so long. Perhaps Gerlach's comments also caused him to be brought to this country after his internment in England, since as has been seen, he was subsequently interrogated in the U,S.A\" where his wartime research diaries remain classified to Ihis day.

This was perhaps invented to honour one of the scientists, who admittedly was nol a member of the research team, but was in some sense connected with the whole project. It concerned Dr Otto Ambros - then chairman of the so~cal1cd \"S\" committee. responsible for chemical warfare preparations in Speer's Annament Ministry. I must admit that from the beginning the plot connected to Ambros was totally belittled by myself. as not matching the whole picture. As it was to become evident a few years later, this was a big mistake - although there was never any doubt that chemical weapons \\\\lcre nol responsible for \"the Bell's\" operation, or any kind of chemical agent.\" This is the same Otto Ambros that was also appointed by I.G. Farben director Karl Krauch to oversee the construction and operation of its huge \"Buna\" synthetic rubber plants at Auschwitz, a plant that Carter Plymton Hyrick has quite persuasively argued was not a Buna plant at all, but a huge uranium enrichment facility.2t Thus, while Witkowski does not seem to be aware of the 20 Witkowski, The Tntth AbolIIthe WIII,del1vqffe. p. 235. 2\\ Carter Plymton Hydrick, Critical Mass: pp. 72-80.

If Ambros was intimately involved with the SS in the enrichment of uranium, and presumably in the recovery of other exotic isotopes, then he would certainly be involved in the Bell project if allY aspect of lhat project required the use of radioactive isotopes. This last condition, radioactive isotopes, I believe is one of the significant clues into the nature of the device and what the Germans were hoping to accomplish with it, as will be seen subsequently in this and later chapters. The fact that his position at the Farben \"Buna\" plant also placed him in the orbit of secret SS research and security jurisdiction of the Auschwitz camps is also another connection that would seem to corroborate Witkowski's revelations that Ambrose was somehow involved with the Bell project. ~ ..... r_ .... _ ........... -- ,- ,-- , - . _\" ft.Ji,... __ 1M BASI\"';\"'~~Rr .. ,c.' ==-- ---- _.;<_.-.- ----\"-- ;..-. . ~tll.AJo\" Dr. Kurt Debus' POW Card 154"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell e.

So what, then, is a rocket scientist doing in a project like the Bell? According to Witkowski's meticulous research, Debus was not a rocket scientist at all, but rather, was interested in the extremely avante garde notion (even for today) of magnetic fields separation. 22 Moreover, he had apparently designed the power supply for the Bell. His parent institution was the institute of High Voltages at Dannstadt Polytechnic (Technische Hochschule). In 1942 he was transferred to the research institute of the AEG consortium in Berlin - Reinickendorf, in addition he also co-operated with the centre in Peenemfinde. He was the author oj several publications and patents regarding high voltage measurement technology. He developed among other things instruments for high pressure measurement and high voltage discharge parameters measurement. At the AEG research institute he constructed a power supply unit, supplying over I million volts current and took pan in the equipping of a supersonic wind tunnel. He also took pan in the development of measurement instruments for the V-2 test launch pads. 23 Needless to say, such interests would not only have made Debus an invaluable contributor to the Nazi rocket program, but more importantly, such experience in the measurement oj high voltage discharge parameters would have made him an expert in phenomena of a wholly different nature, a phenomena that one might qualify under the broad label of\"Teslian.\" But it was Debus' character as a loyal Nazi, much like Gerlach, that led Witkowski to discover and corroborate one of his informer's crucial pieces of information: that the Bell was considered to hold such potential that it was given its own unique classification among all the Third Reich's admittedly exotic secret weapons projects. Debus, according to Witkowski, had informed on one of his co-workers at AEG, one Richard Cramer, to the Gestapo, in 1942. Cramer was sentenced to two years in prison. BUI Cramer was apparently no ordinary German, much less an ordinary engineer, for the chairman of the AEG Research Institute, Prof Dr. Carl Wilhelm Ransauer, wrote a letter to the Gestapo: 22 Wilkowski, The Truth About the WundenvajJe. p. 256. 23 Ibid., emphasis added. 156"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Tire SS Brotlrer/rood of tire Bell Mr. Engineer R.

(I) .. Kriegsentscheidend\" As for the tenn Kriegsentscheidend, Witkowski notes that this term was highly unusual. While the term \"important for the war\" (Kriegswichtig) was a technical term implying a lifting of administrative restrictions in order to procure necessary war 24 Witkowski, The Trlllh About lhe WIIlldenvafJe. p. 257, emphasis Witko\\'v'ski's. 157"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"\"Das Laternelltriigerprojekt\" material,25 the tenn \"decisive for the war\" (Kriegsentscheidend) occurs only in this document and only in connection with whatever research the A.E.G., Dr. Debus, and Mr. Cramer, were conducting.

From Limpinski's descriptions of the transcripts, as compared to their \"public consumption\" declassi fied version, \"something completely different followed\" whenever Gerlach was present and the subject of conversation turned to physics. For \"the topics of conversations were most often: 'atomic nuclei', 'extraterrestrial space', 'magnetic fields' and 'the earth's gravitation. ,,,29 Clearly, Gerlach and Company were involved in something more rarefied than mere atom bombs. Debus' involvement with the Bell raises yet another disturbing series of questions. What was such an ardent Nazi doing as a director of the Kennedy Space Flight center in Cape Canaveral, a post which he was appointed to in 1963? And why would he even be interested in mere rockets when the Bell held so much more potential not only for propulsion, but for so many other things? Why did someone, whose expertise was in the distinctively Tesla field of high voltage electricity discharge measurement, not only find himself involved both in the semi-secret V-2 program and the much more secret Bell project during the war, but after tbe war 25 Ibid., p. 256. \"Ibid. 27 Ibid., p. 255. 28 Ibid. 20 Wilkowski, The Truth Abollt the WlInderll'ajfe. p. 255. 158"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"TheSS Brotherhood of the Bell why was this electrical engineer involved as a director of the Kennedy Space center? 4. Dr. Hermann Oberth Takes a Trip with some Friends Dr. Kurt Debus is not, however, the only Nazi \"rocket\" scientist who was involved with the Bell. Another is the well-known Dr. Hermann Oberth, who, like the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and American Robert Goddard, is one of the three founding fathers of modem rocketry. Oberth's involvement remains a mystery, for some time between September 15 th and September 25 th 1944 he apparently took a \"business trip,\" along with other \"Bell\" project scientists Herbert Jensen, Edward Tholen, and the enigmatic Dr. Elizabeth Adler, from Prague, to Breslau, and eventually to the region where the Bell itself was being tested. 3o Of course, readers familiar with Tom Agoston's work on the Kammlerstab/' or with my previous book on Kammler's super-secret black projects \"think tank,,,32 will recognize immediately the significance of Prague as the home of a number of Nazi secret weapons projects, and its significance for its close proximity to the headquarters of Kammler's secret weapons \"think tank\" at the Skoda Works in Pilsen. And readers familiar with the \"Nazi Legend\" of the UFO will likewise immediately recognize Breslau as the borne of the alleged secret \"flying saucer\" research being conducted there. So it is indeed curious, from a prima facie standpoint alone, that Oberth, a relatively well-known figure, should be accompanying an obscure mathematician whose specialty is unknown, and two other scientists of relative obscurity, on what is apparently a \"fact- finding\" mission to the centers of the Third Reich's most sensitive - and still unknown - secret weapons projects! But Witkowski's commentary on Oberth's involvemenl is perhaps even more unsettling: 30 Ibid, p. 257. 31 Tom Agoston, Blunder!

Namely that in principle it is unknown what Prof. Oberth was engaged in during the war. One could have the impression that this is some kind of light at the end of the tunnel, which until now has been cloaked in the darkness of night. After all it is known for sure that Obcrth was not connected with the centre in PeenemUnde, since in this case he would have undoubtedly held at least one of the positions of command. in other words the fact of his engagement would have been known (thousands of specialists employed there worked afler the war in other countries. from the USA and USSR to even Egypt and so is out of the question that a possible secret of this kind could not be kept hidden). So it seems that some kind oj alternative program had existed. being carried out Jar a long time, and quite a serious one at that. JJ That is, Oberth's presence on this trip, particularly in the company of the mysterious Dr. Elizabeth Adler, whose only known conneclion to German secret weapons projecls is to Ihe Bell, implies the presence already in Nazi Germany of two \"space\" programs, the one for \"public consumption\" represented by the V- 2 and various other rocket projects, and the other, represented by the Bell. Oberth was perhaps the world's then-leading theoretician of the problems and solutions for long IeI'm manned space flight. His presence in the circle of scientists involved with the Bell, such as Dr. Adler, Dr. Gerlach, and Dr. Debus, is yet another clue as to the possible principles of its operation and the possible purpose of the project. We may summarize the possible clues represented by these individuals and organizational relationships surveyed by Witkowski as follows: Individual or Organization F.E.P. \"Admiral Rhein\" A.E.G.(AlIgemeille Elektricitiits Gesellschaji) and the HW A (J-IeereswajJellamt) SS Obergruppenftihrer Emil Mazu\\1,.'

Indeed, such an interpretation would explain the nominal though tacit involvement of the German navy, for manned spaceflight would require the construction of pressure vessels for outer space flight that would entail similar types of expertise as used in the construction of submarine pressure hulls. Additionally, the Gennan navy would clearly be interested in exotic propulsion for its U- boats, to allow them greater underwater cruising time as well as speeds. [n any case, the presence of Debus, A.E.G., and the Army Ordnance Bureau (HeereswajJenaml) that also hovers in the background would seem to indicate a more exclusively \"weapons\" preoccupation with the project. This indication, while mentioned by Witkowski, is, in my opinion, given rather too short shrift in favor of the \"propulsion\" explanation he seems to prefer. However, as the next two chaplers wi II seek to demonstrate, one must not be too quick to dismiss this aspect of the project.

The Operation of the Bell and Its Effects: Witkowski's Reconstnlction of the Bell In outlining Witkowski's presentation of the known operating parameters, construction parameters, and effects of the Bell, I shall attempt to be as thorough as possible in citation of his research, since much of what he says bears directly on my own admittedly more speculative interpretations of some aspects of the Bell. In doing so, I maintain, in concert with Witkowski and Cook, that at a minimum the Bell represented such a breakthrough in \"field propulsion,\" but I maintain that the Bell represents much more than that. I believe that a propulsion breakthrough was the motivation of the project, but I also believe, that along the way and perhaps even near the very beginning of the project before the full- sized \"Bell\" was built, that the Germans also encountered some un-anticipated effects that also became principal areas of investigation for the project. As I will attempt to show, in the light of contemporary models and experimentation, the Bell exhibits many hallmarks of a device deliberately designed to cohere or \"tap into\" the Zero Point Energy, and of a device designed to do so not only for propulsion purposes, but for weaponization. It is thus best seen, perhaps, as a prototypical \"scalar\" device, a prototypical technology of an extremely unified physics. With this in mind, we tum now to Witkowski's survey. I. Where it All Happened According to Witkowski, the principal laboratories for the work on the Bell were in Lower Silesia, in the town of Neumarkt (modern day Sroda Slaska), and Leubus (modern day Lubiaz), disguised inside the facility Schlesische Wekstiitten dr Fiirstenau. The corporate backing was provided by A.E.G. (A llgemeine Elekticitiits Gesellschaft) and the giant Siemens electrical firm.

It could be calculated what was the intensity of the radiation in 1945 and generally it was very high.\" 1n other words, whatever had been tested at the Henge - and there is every indication that it was the Bell - it not only required a sturdy structure to keep it down but also it gave off strong, heavy, radiation. 2. The History and Code-Names of the Project While experiments on the Bell first appear to have been undertaken in May and June of 1944,38 the project itself was conceived some two and a half years earlier, meaning that it required that long to bring whatever theory that underwrote it to practical and technical manifestation. The entire research project as such was created in January 1942 - under the code-name \"Tor\" (\"Gate\"), which functioned until August 1943. Alter this it was renamed or rather divided into two \"sub-projects\". The code-name \"'Tor\" was replaced by the code-names: \"Chronos\" and \"Latementriiger\". Both referred to \"the Bell\", but the project had been divided il1to physical and medieal-biological aspects. It was 110t established which code-name corresponded to a given aspect of the work. The system powering \"the Bell\" probably received the code- name Charile_Anlage ... 39 The code-names are suggestive, since \"Chronos\" means \"time\" in the Greek, and \"gate\" is suggestive enough. Both taken together suggest that at least part of the intention behind the product was to engineer time. If so, it is another indicator that the Nazis had abandoned Special Relativity with its locally flat space. Indeed, they were perhaps experimenting in a kind of \"hyper-relativity\" or a locally-engineered space-time curvature. The significance of tbe code names, then, points to a very radical and exotic physics, one 31 Igor Witkowski, personal correspondence to the author, July 23. 2005. 38 Witkowski.

But what of the other code-name, Lalernentriiger? Literally, it means a \"lantern bearer\" or \"lantern carrier,\" i.e., the individual who lit gas street lights in the era before electric lights and photovoltaic cells dispensed with the need for such lamp-lighters. Bur there may be something more significant in the choice of this particular code-name, as Witkowski notes: \"(One) can look at this from yet another angle. It could be, as it was suggested to me, a not too literal translation of a certain ancient name - the name of 'Lucifer', i.e., 'he wbo carries the light.\",4() [n any case, the important points for our purposes are not only that the code-names may be indicative, at least in a general way, of the exotic physics the project was to investigate, but also that the project was apparently underway for at least two years before a practical technology - the Bell itself - resulted. This implies a high degree of theoretical background work was its inspiration, and that in turn means we must investigate the clues very carefully in an attempt to reconstruct what that theoretical basis might have been. 3. The Last Flighl of the Ju 390 So what happened to the Bell and its research team? As detailed in two of my previous books Reich of the Black Sun and The Giza Death Star Deployed, most of the scientists and technicians were murdered by the SS, and the project hardware itself was evacuated. Indeed, there is now strong evidence that \"Project Lantern Bearer\" (or if one prefer, Project Lucifer) was evacuated in April of 1945 by a six-engine Junkers 390. This is intriguing, since one of the last pictures of the Junkers 390 was taken at approximately the same period at an airfield in Prague. Since at the end of the war there was only one Ju 390 left in existence, this means that it flew from Prague to near Ludwigsdorf (probably the aerodrome at Opole, in Poland), picked up its additional cargo there, and then, according to an SS officer who was involved in the project and his interrogation records which 4l) Witkowski, The Trlllh Abollllhe Wlllldenl'lljJe, pp. 235-236. 167"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"\"Das Laternentriigerprojekt ll Witkowski found in the Berlin Document Center, it was flown to Bodo airbase in Norway, after which, like the Bell and General Hans Kammler, it simply disappears. 4/ The Last Known Picture of a Ju 390, Coincidentally Taken in Prague in J 945.

Witkowski has uncovered certain circumstantial information that appears to corroborate the \"American scenario.\" Among the many other scientists involved with the Bell, there was olle Herbert Jensen, whom we have not mentioned until now. Jensen accompanied the well-known Hermann Oberth, and the very mysterious Elizabeth Adler, on their \"business trip\" from Prague to Lower Silesia.

As for Gerlach and Debus, we have already speculated that their high profiles perhaps saved them from the SS' death squads. Perhaps this is also why Gerlach, having been thus \"warned off' the subject of spin polarization and gravity research, never publicly returned to these subjects after the war. In this regard it is also noteworthy that Gerlach, after his internment by the British at Farm Hall, was also the only Farm Hall scientist who was subsequently transferred to the United States for further intensive interrogation. In my view it is extremely significant that his wartime work diaries were appropriated by the American ass, where they remain classified in the CIA archives. Almost nothing is known of their contents. 43 The fact that Gerlach was singled out for such interrogation and that his wartime diaries were placed under tight classification speaks volumes.

In the light of Carter Hydrick's thesis that Martin Bormann actually aided the United States in the surrender of the U-234 and its valuable cargo of fissile uranium and atom bomb components, Brooks' remarks again underscore the significance and importance as a \"decisive war-winning weapon\" that the Bell had for the Nazis: The Nazis were particularly anxious to protect docUinents containing the highest classifications of secret knowledge designated Geheime Reichssache relating to the development of arms, aircraft and submarines, The most important of all these, files relating to a super aviation fuel and advanced aircraft, went by long-range Junkers Ju 390 transport aircraft directly to Argentina, From the point of view of the US Government, the 260 tons of strategic material aboard the German U-boat U-234 escorted into Portsmouth Navy Yard, New Hampshire, on 19 May 1945 is so absurdly secret that the fact that it is classified as top secret is a secret, as are the documents pertaining to Dr Heinz Schlicke and the nature of the assistance he afforded the Manhattan Project in the three months after his capture. The most secret item of cargo aboard U-234 remains the eighty small cases of uranium powder which have never appeared on any USN Unloading Manifest and which will have been the fissile material for a rudimentary atomic explosive.

While this may seem odd or unusual, it should be recalled that a similar classification scheme has been alleged for captured \"UFO\" technology in the post-war USA, rating it higher than the hydrogen bomb.

Radl disclosed, in documents Witkowski uncovered at the American archives' Berlin Document Center, that Skorzeny had engaged in numerous acts of sabotage behind Russian lines in 1944 because he had \"come into contact with the 'wonder weapon' and as a result (had) 'been possessed' by the idea of'Sonderkampf' (' Special Warfare '), regarding the use of this weapon, to such an extent, that he considered it the only sure way to win the war.,,50 But the matter did not rest there. After the war, according to reports in the Spanish press that were soon followed by similar articles in the American press, Skorzeny had attempted to sell the secrets of this unknown WunderwafJe to the Americans.

The various plants, animals, and presumably hapless concentration camp victims suffered \"various types\" of damage, the most dominant form being \"the disintegration of tissue structures, gelation and the stratification of liquids ~among others blood) into distinctly divided fractions and others.\" I In fact, during the first series of tests, apparently conducted from May to June of 1944, \"these kinds of side-effects caused the death of five out of seven scientists engaged in them. As a result, the whole first research team was dissolved,\" and it became a high priority for the project to limit these effects 62 In other words, the deadly effects of the Bell were not, at least initially, what the Gernlans were apparently after. Its purpose was something different. As we shall see subsequently though, such results and its potential for a deadly new type of weapon could not have been lost on the Germans. Indeed, while Witkowski tends toward the view that the Bell represented a secret project in propulsion of some sort, its classification as Kriegsentscheidend and its clear claim to the title of \"WunderwafJe\" would seem to call for more speculation in this direction, based on Witkowski's disclosures. We will return to this subject momentarily. The oddest changes in organic materials \"were observed in the case of green plants.\" During the first phase, spanning about five hours after the test had been completed, the plants paled or became grey, suggesting chemical decomposition or the decay of chlorophyll. Extraordinary is that despite this, such a plant lived normally, by all appearances, for a further period - the order of a week. This was followed by immediate, almost rapid or cascade (8-14 hours) decomposition to a greasy sllbstance, \"with the consistency of rancid fat, ... enveloping the entire plant.

Unwary, they were exposed to its unusual effects, and the cellular structure of their bodies and fluids broke down completely. As we shall see, such effects are one clear signature of a \"scalar\" device. But these were not the only strange effects associated with the Bell.

Wilkowski's Reconstruction of its Possible Physics Obviously, the above list of the device's construction, its operation, and effects, paints a very unusual picture. What sort of physics lies behind all of it? What were the Germans attempting to accomplish with this bizarre device? Obviously, to have such a complex device in operation by the end of the war would have required some initial testing, planning and designing, taking years of research in its own right. So what were they looking for? What might have been the inspiration? And finally, why would such a device, beyond all the other exotic weapons in the Third Reich's arsenal - an arsenal that included fuel-air bombs, guided missiles, deadly chemical and nerve gases, and possibly even the atomic bomb - be uniquely classified as Kriegsentscheidend, as \"decisive for the war\"?

As Witkowski puts it, the Bell \"possessed so many characteristic features that finding some kind of unequivocal explanation seemed to be attainable.,,67 According to him, these are: • The employment of very high voltages. • An emphasis of the phenomenon of \"magnetic fields separation\". • The occurrence of Hvortex compression\". • The fact that the device generated very powerful magnetic fields. • The spinning of masses I bulky elements as a means to achieve the above etTects (directly or indirectly) • As a result: the generation of powerful radiation. • The continuous character of \"the bel/'s\" operation - i.e., non- pulse • The reference about transforming mercury into gold. 68 This list is interesting, especially as regards the second to last point, the hypothesized \"non-pulsed\" nature of the Bell's operation. This is, of all the material in Wikowski's research, the one item that lacks any corroboration. While Witkowski is correct that this was its most likely mode of operation, there is one clue that the Bell may also have been a pulsed device, and the clue comes from Witkowski himself: the description of its sound like a hive of bees. Such a sound is characteristic of a rapidly opening and closing high voltage direct current switch, such as the type Tesla used in his Impulse Magnifying Transmitter experiments \" Igor Witkowski, Tlte Trutlt About the Wundenvaffe. p. 235. 66 Ibid. \"Ibid., p. 245. \" Igor Witkowski, The Truth About tlte WUlldenvaffe, p. 245, emphasis added. 180"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of tire Bell with direct current. The \"buzz\" sound is characteristic of such devices. The last point brings up yet another oddity in the long list of oddities associated with the Bell, and that is transmutation of elements. It will be seen in the next chapter that there was a curious reference in the Farm Hall transcripts on two separate occasions to a \"photochemical process\" of isotope separation. 1 speculated that it might be some analogue or derivative to cold fusion. But here one encounters the reference in the context of a project having little to due with \"photochemistry\" except in the loosest of senses. As for the reference to transmutation, this is a partly solved problem, for there exists in the Frankfurter Zeitung und Handelsblall, for the evening edition of Friday, June 18, 1924, an article on precisely the transmutation of mercury into gold - long before the discovery of nuclear fission - by none other than Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach!69 Gerlach speaks of such transmutation being possible through the bombardment of a target with \"rays\" of an unspecified nature, and then goes on to speak of the scientific feasibility of alchemy! Seeking to piece all of these pieces together, Witkowski contacted Polish physicist Marek Demia_ski, a specialist in gravitational physics. Outlining the Bell's peculiar properties, Demia_ski concluded that vortex motion might be a key to generating gravitation, and then added that mercury would \"best suit this purpose\" as being \"a substance of high density and simultaneously as a liquid.,,70 Indeed, if the Germans \"had succeeded in aligning the axes of nuclei rotation in one direction, with the aid of a strong magnetic field\" then ~erhaps they had achieved some sort of gravitational breakthrough. I Witkowski next tackled the problem of the apparent high voltages used in the Bell. \"It must have led to a discharge, and consequently it must have been a question of plasma physics.\" If indeed it was the case as Demia_ski suggested that the active substance in such a device be characterized by low viscosity, then til Ibid., p. 257.

This in turn creates a kind of local \"space time continuum\" or localized space curvature. During the period he was formulating these observations, Witkowski visited the Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser Microfusion in Warsaw, where he was met with an incredible site, a plasma trap, having all the characteristic appearance of the Bell!

Nobody yet, nobody after the war - has built a \"plasma focus\" device chiefly for the fasl spinning of heavy ions ... the internal construction of every plasma is purely static. The conception of rotating or coumerrotating cylinders remains unknown. oOOdy has struck upon the idea of doing this! 7S Thus, Witkowski was led to his final reconstruction of the Bell, and the principle of its operation and the reasons the Germans chose this peculiar method of designing a \"plasma focus\": I imagined a large. metal drum, in which a small amount of mercury was present. The drum would then be accelerated to a speed of say tens of thousands of revolutions per minute. Under the influence of the centrifugal force the mercury, as a liquid, would cover the walls of the drum crearing a thin layer. After achieving the target speed a high voltage electrical discharge would be created between the circumference of the drum (the mercury layer) - and its axis - the core. Theoretically this would accelerate the ions of mercury towards the core, with a speed of many kilometers per second. But since the mercury would already possess a certain torque, in due measure of approaching the core its angular velocity would increase ... thus developing an increase in rotational speed. In the case of the drum with mercury this would lead to an overlapping of the two speeds - created by a preservation of the torque and a result of the flow of electric currenl. From my approximate calculations it followed that by this means it would be possible to achieve a speed of the ultimate \"'compressed\" vortex of the order of even hundreds of thousands of revolutions per second. 76 And with these tremendous speeds of rotation with a plasma whose a..yes of rotation were all polarized (lined up in the same direction), it followed that enormous kontrabaryc (anti-gravitational) effects 74 Igor Witkowski, The Trlllh AbDUl the Wlllldenvoffe, p. 250. 7S Ibid. 76 Witkowski, The Trlllh Abolll lite Wlllldenvaffe, p. 251. 183"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"\"Das Laternentriigerprojekt\" might result, since the recent physics literature indicates precisely h . b d· 77 suc a connectIon etween mass an rotatIOn. But what of the transmutation part of it? Sensing that such vorticular structures are an inevitable template of matter itself, Witkowski \"recalled the work of the Russian scientist Genadiy Shipov and works of the German physicist, Professor Burkhard Heim (working during the war at the Goettingen University). In all their works there was reference to changes being created in the structure of materials by artificially generated gravitational waves.,,78 As will be seen subsequently, this is a signal clue that much more was involved in the Bell than a mere plasma focus trap, 77 Wikowski cites Japanese ex.periments in this regard, but one might also point to the various ex.periments of physicist Di Palma. 78 \\Vitkowski, The Truth About the Wundenvaf/e. p. 253.

Gravitational research is, in one respect, obviously the motivation and putpose of the Bell. In his recent July 23, 2005 correspondence with the author, Witkowski also makes another connection that is well worth pondering. Connecting the idea of Umagnetic fields separation\" with atomic spin polarization, Witkowski then goes on to state: \"'We know from contemporary references that the 'separation' may be achieved in various ways, like by a superconductor or through a so called pinch in plasma. As I intetpreted this, it may refer to a relativistic isolation of a \"reference frame\". h's an idea that has been derived from Einstein's theory, before the Second World War. NASA has launched the Graviry Probe B spacecraft last year (which has fast spinning balls surrounded by a material superconducting in this temperature, in order to isolate the magnetic field, therefore to basically verify the same effect only that without plasma.) They quoted a different reference however: the theory developed in Germany and Austria before the war mostly by Hans Thirring, a theory of spacetime and gravity which takes into account such a \"separation\" - if not for NASA, the work would be largely forgotten.\" Witkowski also mentions in his letter that Thirring was a close associate of Dr Walther Gerlach. 184"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell even one incorporating the insightful concept of rotating the active substance to achieve maximum spin polarization, a concept well in keeping with Gerlach's interests.

A Story from the Neo-Nazi Fringe Amazingly, there is a story from the Neo-Nazi fringe element in North America that oddly corroborates many detai Is of Witkowski's reconstruction. The story is made the more remarkable for the fact that it appeared prior to the publication either of Nick Cook's Hunt for Zero Point or of the research on which its revelations on the Bell were based: Witkowski's The Truth About the WunderwaJJe. The story emanated from notorious \"holocaust revisionist\" Eric Zundel's Samizdat Press in Canada. The story allegedly came from a \"Prof. Dr. Friedrich Kuhfuss, who died in Barcelona, Spain, in exile, having never been captured by the Allies.,,79 Deep among the near-primeval, dark and foreboding forests, somewhere in one of the many hilly areas of Germany, there was a secret base simply called X. To the outside world it looked like an ancient hunting lodge, perched atop a small hill. Only two meandering winding roads led up to the \"Jadgschloss\" as German woodsmen and small farmers of the nearby village (about 8 km distant) would simply call it. ...

Nobody was to fraternize with these people and all strangers or strange happenings were to be immediately reported to the S.S. Ortskommandatur .... A few days later, truck after truck loaded with construction equipment of every conceivable description rolled through the village .... Soon loud and frightening blasts could be heard day in and day out, reverberating through the valleys. After a few months they ceased. Then huge, slow-moving, flatbed trucks began to arrive carrying loads, covered with tarpaulins all chained to the platforms and guarded by soldiers. This went on for many, many weeks. By now the whole village was rife with the most unbelievable rumours. One night, the entire village was awakened and terribly frightened by sound of such high pitch and frequency that had commenced only as a hardly audible humming, that it was soon realized that something very unusual was happening. They rushed outside and to their utter amazement and bewilderment they saw a brilliantly illuminated \"thing\" hovering in the air in the general direction of the Jagdschloss. Then, just as violently as it had announced its arrival the sound died down, the light faded and the strange \"thing\" settled behind the treetops, out of thc sight of the relieved, yet still shaken local people .... Soon several of these strange vehicles, each a little different from the other, were flying about, at first slowly but later at such fantastic speeds that it was difficult to follow them with the naked eye .... Sometimes, when flying so fast, they made frightful noises, big bangs, that reverberated around rhe valleys rather like heavy thunderclaps . .. ... So, the months became years, then one day long columns of trucks clogged the roads. Since there were two roads into and out of the Jagdschloss it was difficult to know what was transpiring, but soon they knew. Less and less flying \"things\" were seen and soon the camp was only a shadow of its former self. One day all work ceased, tremendous explosions ripped, once again, through the valley, smoke rose from the area of the Jagdschloss and a few weeks later the Russians rode into town, unopposed, raping and looting everything in sight .... Little did (the Russians) realize that in those caved-in caverns, with electrical cables and wires dangling from now damp ceilings, on the debris- littered floors, in seemingly endless halls, with strange burn marks on the concrete floors, walls and ceilings, had taken place one of the wonders of the world ... only worthless bits of pieces of metal, nuts, bolts, steel rods, rubber tires, some leather and some strange-looking 186"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"rhe 55 Brotherhood of the Bell and feeling \"slack like,\" grayish substance was to be found amongst all the rubble. 80 There are a number of things that would tend to indicate that this story is pure fantasy. First, and most importantly, the idea of SS officers openly carrying briefcases of secret research in the local Gasthaus is utter nonsense. For the loyalty-and-security obsessed 5S such breaches would have been unthinkable; but, if committed by any member, swiftly and ruthlessly dealt with. Secondly, as Witkowski stated in a personal letter to this author, neither the more modern Schloss or the mediaeval castle at Fiirstenstein were ever used as hunting lodges 8t But there are also a number of things to notice here that corroborate Witkowski's reconstruction of the Bell in a general fashion, and that therefore tend to indicate that the story contains some elements of truth; indeed, it contains many elements in common with Witkowski's history of the Bell project, a coincidence made more compelling for the fact that it predates Witkowski's published work, and for the fact that it comes from a source with profoundly pro-Nazi sympathies. The latter point would, in fact, tend to indicate that someone, somewhere, and independent of any government, knew all about the project and what it had accomplished. First, the story concerns a heavily forested and hilly area of Germany, which Schloss Fiirslensleill certainly qualifies for. Secondly, the area, and hence the project reported by the story, were under SS jurisdiction. Thirdly, there was a concentration camp involved to supply slave labor for the construction and presumably for the project. 82 Fourthly, the story indicates that a great amount of blasting occurred, which strongly suggests that a great deal of underground construction took place. As Witkowski notes, there are clear indications that the whole complex of Fiirstenstein was full of tunnels and galleries constructed during 80 Friedrich Marrem.

Fifthly, very obviously the object reported by the village inhabitants in the story gave off strong field effects, a similariry witb the Bell that is all too palpable. Sixthly, it is also clear from the story that heavy electrical cabling was involved, yet another connection with the story of the Bell. Seventhly, there is the report of a \"slacklike\" gray substance found among the rubble, clearly recalling the reports of blackish or grayish goo that resulted from the Bell's tests on organic materials. Eighthly, the story recounts the burning and scorching of concrete and stone walls, tending to support the idea that whatever was involved put out strong radiation, another parallel with the Bell as recounted by Witkowski. Finally, the story records the fact that the site was apparently quickly and thoroughly evacuated by the SS, along with more blasting, an indicator, perhaps, that some of the tunnels and galleries were sealed by the SS to prevent whatever that remained from falling into Russian hands. Here again, the broad outline is consistent with the story of the Bell, with the SS' removal of the object and execution of some of the scientists and technicians involved. However, one must weigh this against the unbelievable elements of the story. It is not only unlikely but entirely ludicrous that SS officers involved in a top secret black project would, on their \"off hours,\" glibly be carrying about secret papers in their briefcases or talking more or less openly about their work at the local Gasthaus. 7. Mercury Vortex Engines ... Again As was mentioned previously, Witkowski does not take his analysis of the Bell any further than to imply that it was a uniquely designed plasma vortex trap that perhaps achieved extraordinary kontrabaric effects. Those effects, if one is to believe the reports of inhabitants of the region who spoke of \"flying barrels\" or even if one is to credit the story from the Neo-Nazi source above, would have been so sensational that the Nazis would have given the device extreme classification. But Witkowski is alive to the fact that the Bell might represent much more.

They had applied after all ideas from XXI century physics. How is it, that they were conscious of bringing about a major turning-point? \\Vhat arguments did they lay down (before the launch of work) that caused them to win the race for funds with the great and influential annaments consortiums? And they won decisively. It seems that the whole issue is something morc than just a technical problem. The unusualness of all this is summed up by the fact, that descriptions of mercuric propulsion had appeared as long ago as in anciem times - in alchemy and old Hindu books - onc can easily check this. The \"Samaranganasurradhara\" a book at least 2,000 years old, said for example: \"By means oJthe power latem in the mercury >'vhich sets the driving whirlwind in motioll., a man Sitting inside may travel a great distance in (he sky in a most man1elolls mallner ... 81 Witkowski is clearly suggesting that the inspiration for the project might have come from the SS' preoccupation with the occult, and Fom its investigations of the possible SCientific underpinnings in various occult and esoteric treatises. We have encountered this theme before, and, as regards the so- called \"mercury vortex engines,\" shall have more to say in chapter Stx. But here Witkowski ends his reconstruction of the Bell and his own speculations as to its operation and the actual goals tbe Germans hoped to achieve with it. In doing so, a number of significant questions remain unanswered. It will be recalled from the foregoing presentation that Witkowski rightly understands the importance of the rotation of the mercury or Xerum-525 substance in the device. But, having once mentioned it, he never considers what the Germans may have been hoping to accomplish by counter-rotation of the same substance. In short, the kontrabaric effects of the Bell are explained by one rotating cylinder. So why were there two cylinders on a 83 Igor \\Vitkowski, The Truth Abolll the WunderwajJe. p. 284, emphasis Witkowski's. 189"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"\"Das Laternentriigerprojekt U common axis rotating in opposite directions? Equally important: what was their configuration? Was one cylinder inside the other? Or was one cylinder on top of the other? A related question is this: beyond the possible esoteric and occult inspirations, what in the physics literature of the day might have formed the basis of the Lantern-Bearer Project? As we shall see, the Germans had a number of scientists other than Gerlach who realized the importance of vortices for the very building blocks of matter. Once this idea is stated, one inevitably sees the implication, for if vortices constitute the fundamental building blocks of matter, then they also constitute a template of action for the transmutation of one form of matter into another, as well as a template for a variety of other actions as well. Yet another question to be at least speculatively answered is why the device was enclosed in a ceramic, bell-like shell? Was this choice of material, and its shape, significant? Similarly, the characteristic sound the Bell made while in operation was like a beehive. This sound could be indicative of a rapidly opening and closing switch to pulse the device with high voltage (most likely, direct) current. Finally, the Bell's effects on living organisms - whatever its extraordinary kontrabaric and \"temporal dilation\" effects might have been - surely could not have been lost on the Germans either. Clearly they were in the presence of a phenomenon that could be applied in a variety of ways, as a means perhaps of propulsion, perhaps even of communication, and perhaps also as a weapon. The phenomenon the Nazis had accessed via the Bell was a unified phenomenon and pointed to an underlying unified physics. The question is, what is that phenomenon? What were the Nazis after? Did they know what they had accessed? Why does the figure of Gerlach keep popping up? Why, for example, is an expert in spin polarization, gravitation, transmutation of elements, and mercury plasma, placed in charge of Nazi Germany's public atom bomb project? Why are his diaries still classified? Why would an anti-gravity device suddenly become a WunderwafJe? What possible type of physics could underlie all these things? 190"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell Witkowski himself points the way to the theme that will guide us in the next few chapters: vortices. 191"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"5. \"Working in jfielb.£i of ~b!,.£iic.£i tbat hJere jMon.£itrou.£i on a :mail!, ~a.£ii.£i\" \"(Scalw) weapons are the most powelflll andjlexible weapons on earth.

The \"Artificial Rubies\" Passageji-om The Farm Hall Transcipls (Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 142-132) On pages 142 and 143 of Reich of the Black Sun I observed that one of the interred Farm Hall scientists made a rather astonishing statement, a statement made astonishing not only for its \"matter-of-fact\" passing nature and brevity, but also because it called forth almost no comment from the editor of the transcripts: Then, on July 21, 1945, the handsome and cynical Horst Korsching, discussing the prospects for making a living with Diebner and Bagge, offers a curious observation: \"BAGGE: For the sake of the money, I should like 10 work on the uranium engine; on the other hand, I should like to work on cosmic rays. I feel like Diehner about this. \"KORSCHING: Would you both like to construct an uranium engine\" \"DI EBNER: This is the chance to earn a living. \"KORSCH ING: Every layman can see that these ideas are exceedingly important.

In modern high-teeh jargon, the operation would probably be referred to as an \"55 research think tank.\" Some work on second-generation secret weapons, including the application of nuclear propulsion for aircraft and missiles, was already well advanced. 4 What is interesting is the juxtaposition of these two quotations, for while Agoston offers no evidence for his assertion that the SS was working on the development of lasers during the war, he nonetheless clearly states that this was an avenue of research being pursued. Thus, the subsequent appearance of the Farm Hall Transcripts in the early 1990s oddly corroborates Agoston's assertions with Korsching's very curious reference to artificial rubies, a then costly and time-consuming process that surely would have merited more than merely making rubies for watches. Since the transcripts had not yet been declassified by the British government when Agoston wrote his book, we can only assume that AgostOD did not know the contents of the still secret Transcripts and was basing his assertions on his confidential talks with Dr. Wilhelm Voss, who first disclosed the story of Kammler's black projects secret weapons think tank. 3 Joseph P.

While we do not yet know how far they pressed this research, nor to what degree of success, it is in any case not of immediate concern, since the theoretical possibility of lasers already existed within quantum mechanics at that time. But what is of real interest is the type of physics that Agoston's and Korsching's remarks - made decades apart and independently of each other - indicate about the nalllre of the physics concepts the Gennans were investigating, in this case, aspects of quantum mechanics and coherence. As was seen in Reich of the Black Sun, Nazi ideology itself, with its rejection of \"Jewish\" relativistic physics, would have naturally turned to the horne-grown, \"purely Aryan\" and equally successful, quantum mechanical theory as a conceptual basis from which to pursue its advaoced projects. We shall relllm to this all-important though brief clue, coherence, in a moment. For now, let us turn our allention to a second odd quotation, another weird glimpse into the possible areas of physics the SS was investigating. 2. The Farm Hall Transcript's Indications of a German Photochemical Process of Isotope Separation and Enrichment As recounted in Reich of the Black SlIn, once the interred German scientists had learned of the Allied a-bombing of Hiroshima, they then begin to debate how the Allies could have \"done it so soon,\" a discussion that naturally quickly turns to the question of separating and enriching enough uranium 235 isotope. In one short exchange between Karl Wirtz and Otto Hahn, the discoverer of nuclear fission, the deduction is quickly made by Hahn that the Allies could only have achieved the production of a uranium a-bomb with such processes, a sentiment quickly echoed by Wirtz with his comment \"They have it too, ,,5 a short admission pregnant with implications that methods of isotope separation were clearly known and available to the Gennans during the war.

WEIZsACKER: What do you do with these centrifuges? HARTECK: You can never get pure \"235\" with the centrifuge. But J don't believe that it can be done with the centrifuge. W1RTZ: No certainly not. HAHN: Yes, but they could do it with mass spectrographs. Ewald has some patent. D1EBNER: There is also a photochemical process. 6 As Reich of the Black Sun goes on to indicate, this little exchange is a sign that perhaps the scientists are playing out a farce on their British captors, and that the farce may even be continuing by the British themselves in their declassification of the transcripts. What do I mean by this? What I mean is that the British declassification is significant for when it occurs, and I only explored a few of the possible reasons in the previous book: Note that the transcripts are declassified by the British after the German reunification in 1989, an oblique admission, perhaps, that there was no more purpose in maintaining whatever secrets they still held, since there would now be other sources available to tell the story that had been long suppressed: that the Nazis had been either perilously close to, or had aCIl/ally acql/ired the atom bomb before the Allies' To see what the \"farce\" being played out by the interred German scientists and the British government's declassification may be, one needs to examine a significant question that [ only hinted at in 6 Bernstein, Hiller '.'I Uranium Club, p, 118, emphasis added, cited in Reich ojtheB/ackSl/fl,pp.144-145. , Joseph P.

II But perhaps we really do know what this mysterious though unknown photochemical process of isotope enrichment is. A clue is again afforded by the timing of the declassification of the Farm Hall Transcripts: after German reunification. But their declassification also occurs after another significant event, the discovery and publication of the firs! cold ji/sion experiments by Pons and Fleischmann. Most do not associate cold fusion with isotope separation and enrichment, but the fact of the matter is, by very easily engineered processes that might bes! be called precisely\" e/ eClrolylic \" or \"photochemical \", n uc 1 ear transmutation of elements has been observed in laboratories all over the world since then, and using materials relatively easily 8 Bemstein, Hitler's Uranium Club, p. 148, cited in Reich of the Black Sun, p. 148. 9 Jeremy Bernstein, the editor and annotator of the transcripts. 10 Referring to Bernstein's comment on p. 120, n. 38, of Hitler's Uranium Cll/b. \"Joseph P.

The literature covering these cold fusion transmutations is easily available on any internet search. 12 [f this or something similar is indeed what the Germans meant by a \"photochemical process,\" then the contents of the Farm Hall Transcripts are nothing less than revolutionary, for it means that we have a second indicator, in a very different way, that the Germans were researching the phenomenon of quantum coherence of the medium in a variety of systematically pursued ways. IJ On this view the timing of the release of the transcripts is significant in a dual way, as occurring (I) after German reunification and (2) after the first public release of cold fusion experimental data. The implications of the transcripts' two allusions to such a photochemical process by interred German scientists in 1945 is staggering, for if they had actually discovered and conducted such experiments - and there was certainly ideological impetus from the Nazi government in its pursuit of \"energy independence\" to do so - and if they had advanced from an initial \"Pons and Fleischman\" apparatus to a more sophisticated version that accomplished the transmutation of elements at room temperature, as in the recent Japanese experiments, then we have a second, though still tenuous, indicator that the SS was pursuing some very extraordinarily advanced physics conceptions indeed. And there would have been little if anything required in such experiments that did not exist in some form available to the Gernlans during the war. 12 Q.v. the crucial paper on penn eat ion methods for transmutation by Yasuhiro IwamuTa, Mitsuru Sakano, Takehiko Itoh, \"Elemental Analysis of Pd Complexes: Effects of D, Gas Penneation,\" Japall Jallrnal oj Applied Physics.

As for the SS and fusion research, German researcher Karl-Heinz Zunneck states that fusion energy was one area or the 5S's investigations, though he does not indicate how far it had pressed this research (see Karl Heinz Zunneck, Geheimtechfl%giefl, WlIllderwaffe IIlld die irdischell Facetrell des UFO-Phiillomells, Schleusingen, Gennany: Amun Verlag, 2002), p. 151.) 13 [ realize that at this juncture the teon \"quantum coherence\" seems to have little to do with cold fusion, but will expand the term to a more accurate description later. Suffice it to say that the only viable explanations for the anomalous excess energy present in cold fusion experiments is that some aspect of the vacuum energy has been cohered and entered the experiments via mechanisms not yet fully understood. 198"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell Small wonder then, that when Wirtz begins to talk of irradiation at particular wavelengths that the other scientists appear to begin talking all at once, as if to drown out his comments from the British recorders, an effort that, if one takes Bernstein's editorial mystification as any indicator, was entirely successful. 14 What do we have, then, at this juncture? First, we have allusions, from the same source, to two different phenomena - lasers and a \"photochemical process\" of nuclear transmutation - involving quantum coherence at some level. Second, in the case of the reference to artificial rubies and their implied use in lasers, we have further corroboration from an independent source of research, Agoston, whose corroboration of the \"laser\" side of the story comes prior to the release of the Transcripts themselves and Korsching's passing remark about artificial rubies. Finally, the declassification and release of the Farm Hall Transcripts themselves may be significant with respect to timing in a dual sense, as occurring after German reunification, and after the first public release of cold fusion laboratory data by Pons and Fleischmann. 3. Back to Roswell and the Majestic 12 Documents: Another Odd Corroboration of Possible Nazi Knowledge of Cold Fusion This last point, and the reference to cold fusion, is highly significant for yet another reason. In Reich of the Black Sun I also attempted to subject some of the Cooper-Cantwheel Majestic-12 documents to an analysis of their technical descriptions of the crashed and allegedly \"extraterrestrial\" vehicle(s), with a view to determine if the technical data warranted a conclusion that the crashed and recovered vehicle(s) was necessary piloted by \"ET\" and if the technical data as summarized in the documents conclusively demonstrated a non-terrestrial origin for the craft. 15 14 Bernstein would certainly know of cold fusion, so his mystification may reflect rather his own adherence to that school of \"public consumption physics\" that rejects a priori any validity to cold fusion claims, since they represent an \"open systems\" paradigm and approach 10 COP> I systems.

One of the objects recovered and described in those documents was a circular plastic tube, about one inch in diameter, through the center of which ran a copper tube. A liquid solution appeared to exist inside the tube, which the document implies is \"water.\" At this juncture, as I noted in Reich of the Black Sun. the Nazi \"Project Paperclip\" rocket scientists were brought in to examine the craft and make a pronouncement. Two of the scientists who allegedly examined the craft were Von Braun and Von Karman, \"who were unable to identify\" the craft as a Nazi V-Weapon. However, they were able to hypothesize that its propulsion was via \"a very radical form of propulsion via a charge differential, a fact that suggests that while they may not have been able to identify it, they at least may have had their strong suspicions.,,16 Additionally, the almost Single-mindedly \"terrestrial\" nature of the technology described should be clearly obvious: a simple plastic tube, approximately an inch in diameter, filled with a substance that is apparently water, in the center of which is a rod wrapped with a coil of \"what appears to be ... copper material.\" Moreover, apparently enough examination or analysis and speculation had been done for the investigators to conclude that the doughnut reactor was somehow a \"heavy water\" reactor, and that the German scientists are already thinking in terms of a fusion rather than a fission reactor. This is perhaps significant, for the equipment described, in the context of fusion, suggests the same apparatus set up, in some respects, as the process later known as cold fusion. 17 Why would the scientists Von Braun and Von Karman have even been thinking in such terms in 1947? Clearly, one reason is that if the Majestic-12 documents are indeed genuine, and therefore describing real events, then any hot fusion reaction would simply have disintegrated any such \"plastic doughnut\" in a matter of nanoseconds. Consequently, this means that the Nazi rocket scientists are thinking in such unconventional terms that it compels the possibility that they might have seen or heard of such technology before. This is another indicator, from yet a totally 16 Ibid., p. 306. 17 Ibid., pp. 306-307. 200"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell different quarter that a very different habit of \"physics thinking and conceptualization\" may have been very common currency within the bowels of the Third Reich's secret weapons projects. It may further indicate yet again that much more was being done at Peenemunde during the war than research into mere rockets. We now have an extremely odd assortment of statements indeed. One group of German scientists are talking about \"photochemical processes\" of isotope separation and enrichment, which sounds an awful lot like cold fusion, while yet another group of German scientists from a wholly different weapons project is talking about more or less the same thing, and yet a third scientist from the first group is found making one short but highly provocative statement about artificial rubies. Taken together these are strong indicators that within the \"reach\" of SS Obergruppenftihrer Hans Kammler's black projects empire the idea of quantum coherence was apparently a central research preoccupation, and that a variety of avenues were being pursued to make the \"coherence\" of the zero point energy - and weapons based upon it - a practical possibility. But there is yet a final quotation that we must examine with regard to whatever exotic and unifying conceptual foundations the Nazi physicists and engineers may have been seeking. 4. A British Intelligence Agent's Statement on the Monstrolls Areas of Physics being Developed by the Kammlerstab As recounted in Reich of the Black Sun, a statement was made to German atom bomb project researchers Edgar Meyer and Thomas Mehner by an anonymous British intelligence source, an individual who had been a part of the British and American intelligence teams sent in to vacuum Kammler's Black Reich- within-the-Reich of every patent and secret weapons project they could find. The man referred to a \"fourth team\" within SS Obergruppenftihrer Hans Kammler's secret weapons \"think tank,\" The fact that he chose to remain anonymous speaks for itself; clearly, there is someth ing extraordinary and much more dangerous than nuclear or thermonuclear weapons in the SS' bag of\"alchernical physics:\" 201"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"to \"Iorkillg ill Fields of Physics that were MOllstrous 011 a Daily Basis\" Yes, and then there was also the fourth team, about which we heard rumors during the last phase of the war.

I mean 10 imply thai these specialists worked in conceptions IhollO/ally abandoned convelllional physical laws. f8 While this quotation clearly pointed in the direction of some of the more exotic weapons projects that were subsequently outlined in Reich of the Black Sun, the fundamental question it poses nonetheless remains: just exactly what type of strange physics were the Germans actually up to with their \"implosion engines\", \"blade less turbines,\" radar absorbent materials research, and even the Bell itself? Were all these projects merely indicative of some mad, insane hodge-podge of a desperate Reich trying to save an increasingly disastrous military situation by snatching at any means to achieve it whatsoever? Clearly such an explanation would explain much of the case, but not everything, and particularly not the quotations being examined in more detail here. So is there an underlying conceptual foundation for all these things, a conceptual foundation that would call forth such a sobering evaluation from a British intelligence agent implying monstrous areas of physics and the destruction of the world in a context that clearly implies he is not referring to mere atom or hydrogen bombs? To answer this important question, one must examine the statements of Lt. Col.

B. Bearden's Reconstruction of the History of Scalar Physics Lt. Col. Tom Bearden has been a consistent proponent of the possibility of accessing the so-called \"Zero Point Energy\" or ZPE by means of what he calls \"scalar physics\" for almost two decades 20 More importantly, one consistent aim of his works has been to point out the extreme power and danger of such physics when it is weaponized. Indeed, much of his writing was initiated by the concern to alert the West and America to the dangers of an on-going Soviet quest to perfect scalar weapons. [ recounted much of the history of the Soviet development of such weapons in my book on the Weapon Hlpothesis of the Great Pyramid, The Giza Death Star Deployed 2 That history is reprised, and expanded, here. To understand why the Soviet Union would have developed such awesome weaponry - and their potential power wi II be discussed below - one must go back to the end of World War Two, the beginning of the nuclear age, and the Cold War. One must comprehend the geopolitical and military situation of that time not only from the Russian point of view but from Slalin's point of view. Fully one half of the fifty million military and civilian casualties of World War Two were suffered by the Russians.22 20 More recently, Col. Bearden has also used the tenn \"energetics\" - coined by the Soviets themselves - and \"'quantum potential weapons\" to refer to this type of physics.

For the German Wehrmacht, the sheer scale of operations on the Russian front dwarfed all others; all other fronts, the Italian and French theaters, were for the Nazi military colossus a mere sideshow. The barbarity of that campaign and the enormous loss of life it caused were the result, not of a conflict between good and evil, but of two barbarous, genocidal and paranoid regimes intent on their own survival and the utter annihilation of the other. After a three-month campaign in 1941, the Wehrmacht came within a hair's breath of doing just that, and the Red Army, after clawing its way back with rivers of its own blood, over the next three and a half years, finally succeeded. Consequently, by the end of the war, Soviet Russia was in tatters. Not only had she lost approx.imately sixteen percent of ber pre-war population, but the cities of European Russia were piles of rubble; her workforce, industry, and infrastructure were severely dislocated and strained. Her manpower reserves were exhausted, her economy was a shambles, and her people understandably war weary. To make this dismal military picture even more bleak, America had successfully developed the atomic bomb and deployed it in war. To the Western All ies, therefore, the picture looked as if the Red Army - superbly equipped and competently led - was poised to roll over Western Europe. But to Stalin and his marshals tbe situation was bleak. He needed to demobilize, but in effect, could not, since the Red Army was his one credible bargaining chip. Only its sheer size, its quality of arms and its leadership, offset the American atomic monopoly. Therefore, much to the chagrin of Soviet economic planners, they had to do the impossible.

Large review institutions were quickly set up. staffed with the best Soviet scientists and support translators and teams. One such search institute involved some 2,000 Ph Os along with their support staffs. Soviet ships brought in shiploads of copies of all the scientific journals of the West - from the beginniog - , and they were reviewed paper-by- paper, page-by-page.

Soviet physics in particular was, due to Russia's isolation and communist ideology, in almost the same situation as physics had been in the Nazi Reich. Bearden's argument now takes a decidedly speculative tum, but one that is very convincing. Arguing that the Soviet have scalar weapons because certain events and physical anomalies in post- war history bear the clear signature of scalar physics, he then poses the question of how and why the Soviets were led to develop such weapons.

Two of them were by the well-known mathematician and theoretical physicist E.T. Whittaker, and one was by a physicist named Barns. Of the three, the Whittaker papers are breathtaking in their implications, not the least of which because they can be made to work within the context of the later- developed quantum theory. The first paper, a lengthy and highly mathematical tome, is a masterpiece whose full implications - in spite of its benign and somewhat intimidating title \"On the partial differential equations of mathematical physics\" - are spelled out by Whittaker in the conclusion of the paper(l have italicized the significant portions that bear directly on Bearden's analysis which follows): It is clear from the foregoing that the field of force due to a gravitating body can be analyzed, by a \"spectrum analysis\" as it were, into an infinite number of constituent fields; and although the whole field of force does not vary with time, yet each of the constituent fields is of an ulldulatory character, consisting of a simple wave-disturbance propagated with uniform velocity ....

T. Whittaker was also a physicist who believed ardently in the aether, i.e., in a medium or mechanism of electromagnetic energy propagation. Indeed, he is the same Whittaker who wrote a classic history of the concept of the aether. Note also that this paper was originally published in Germany, and therefore, the Germans could hardly have been unaware of its existence or of its importance as a non-relativistic physics as they sought to explain the curious anomalies of the Coler Coil or their late war radar experiments, Indeed, their experiments with radar, l8 E.

To understand what Bearden means by \"scalar\" waves in the medium or vacuum, we must now go further into the history of where public consumption physics went wrong. According to Bearden, it began to make its first massive wrong turn after Maxwell. Maxwell first formulated his equations in a mathematical language all but extinct today, a mathematical language called quaternion geometry. This mathematical language differs significantly from the standard \"linear algebra,\" \"tensor calculus\" and \"vector analysis\" in which the standard electromagnetic theory is usually couched in textbooks and physics lectures. In short, the equations one learns in physics textbooks and physics courses today as Maxwell's equations are not Maxwell's original equations! They are edited equations. But to understand what effect this simple change of mathematical language - from quaternions to vector analysis - had on physics, we need to understand a few simple concepts. First, there are two type of effects that electromagnetic fields can have on charged particles: (I) translation, and (2) stress. There are two types of translation, or movement. The first type is simple translation in a straight line, producing the electrical, or \"E\" field itself. The second type of movement is that of a spiral, mathematically symbolized as the \"B\" field. We will not be dealing with the \"B\" field immediately.

Thus, in systems where a large number of translation vectors are involved, \"the entire system can be replaced by a single vector,\" the resultant, which describes the actual translation that results from the original vectors. J9 Now observe that if no translation occurs, the resultant is a \"zero vector.\" However, one must always recall that one is dealing with geomelly and not simply mathematics or numbers. One can therefore envision a multitude of multi-vector systems resulting in a zero translation vector, and yet which have profoundly different internal stresses and geometries: 39 Bearden, \"Maxwell's Original Quatemion Theory was a Unified Field Theory of Electromagnetics and Gravitation:' Proceedings of the international Testa Society, 6/24-6/68, p. 6/24. 214"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell If one were trained to think only in tenns of the conventions of linear algebra to replace multi-vector systems with a resultant vector, then in each of the three cases or systems above, one will replace the entire system with a zero resultant vector. This means that the internal stresses of the systems and their rotational characteristics - each obviously quite different - are all replaced by a zero vector, and thus the three systems are erroneously reduced to physical equivalence by a mathematical convention! Now we are in a position to see what a scalar is, and why Maxwell deliberately chose quaternion geometry to write his equations, for he had in mind when he did so precisely the types of physical stress situations that are simply represented by the vortices in the above diagram. In standard linear algebra, each of the arrows in the above system would be mathematically represented like this: v(vector) = ai + bj + ck. Thus, if the total sum of all such vectors is no translation, then one will replace all such mathematical expressions with a zero vector. But as we have seen, each of these systems contains an internal rotation or stress, so something remains. The question is, how to represent it mathematically? 215"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"\" JVorking in Fields of Physics that were Monstrous 011 a Daily Basis\" In quaternion geometry, a quaternion is simply a \"scalar\" plus a \"vector,\" and a \"scalar\" is simply a pure magnitude, a \"number\" that has no direction. It simply \"is.\" Thus, a quaternion (q) is a scalar(s) plus a vector (v): q=s+v Substituting our previous expression of a vector into this, we get q = s + ai + bj + ck. Thus, for the hexagonally shaped system above, one would have six different expressions resembling q = s + ai + bj + ck. Now imagine we multiply each of these vectors. According to tbe special rules in linear algebra for multiplying such things, we know that zero times zero is zero. So in linear algebra one would end up with notbing once again, a zero vector, since no translation bas occurred. But in quaternion geometry the scalars, which are 1I0t zero, all multiply, and give - according to the rules of quaternion multiplication - the following result: where Ov is the zero vector and tbe squared quanlllles are the multiplied scalars. Thus, in quaternion geometry the internal stress is preserved even though there is zero translation occurring. The scalars thus represent pure magnitudes of force \"locked within\" a structure possessing no \"direction\" or \"translation. \" Now we are in a position to understand what scalar physics is: it is not standard vector or \"linear\" physics in any sense, but is the 1I0n-lillear physics of imernal stresses in the local medium. We are likewise now in a position to understand the enormous implications of the end of Whittaker's paper quoted above, implications that Bearden's analysis makes quite clear: (The) interference of scalar potentials - each of which is actually a set of longitudinal (electromagnetic) waves, and not a scalar entity at all, but a multivectorial entity - produces (electromagnetic) fields and waves and their dynamics.

Thus, Whittaker \"decomposes\" the scalar entities into pairs of such pressure waves or \"stresses\" in the medium. Combining, or \"interfering\" such waves thus causes the standard electromagnetic fields and waves observed in standard physics. And most importantly, this can be done \"at a distance.\" But what does this mean? Simply put, since every atom and every type of atom consists of particles with charge and/or mass, then every atom has its own peculiar \"scalar signature\" or \"resonance\" (recall the diagrams above and imagine the mathematical notations that would describe each in quatemion geometry). Thus, to produce an effect on any one of these systems, one simply has to \"work backwards\" as it were, and configure its scalar signature, decomposing each of the scalars into its own pair of bi-directional longitudinal pulses and waves.

(Whenever) one activates a large scalar (electromagnetic) weapon, one immediately places the entire earth in deadly peril. The slightest misstep, and it's curtains for everyone. And it's curtains for the earth as well. 49 It takes only a little imagination to see that this principle could be pressed even farther, to the inability of the planet to damp its violent, scalar-induced acoustic cavitation. The planet would consume itself in a violent explosion making a hydrogen bomb look like a firecracker. But in any case, as Bearden makes abundantly clear, scalar weapons possess planet-busting potential. This in turn corroborates yet another seemingly fantastic assertion that German researchers Mayer and Mehner made in their own investigations of the Nazi atom bomb.

Did the Third Reich really prepare the Doomsday Weapon? And if so, where is this technology today? Was it discovered by the Allies or does it lurk secretly deep in the earth waiting for its rediscovery? Is such an Ultimate Weapon has already been in existence for more than fifty years, then it is a le,itimate question to ask what today's military really, actually possesses. I Such planet-busting potential over the vast stellar distances of the solar system would seem to be the best and most viable candidate to fulfill this role for it is the only physics that lay within the possibilities of the then existent technology that had the requisite destructive power and enormous range. Additionally, as will be argued subsequently here, there is every indication that this type of physics is exactly what is being presented in the technology of the Bell and various other experiments the Nazis were conducting. b. The Scalar Template and Weapons Applications It will be recalled that any physical object, from an atom of any particular element, to planets, has a \"scalar signature\" that is unique to it. Thus, the notion of a \"template\" containing information loaded into that scalar signature - or one might say \"modulated by it\" - means that scalar physics is an extremely flexible physics. Depending on the configuration of the signature and the amount of power used, one might induce beneficial biological or psychological effects at a distance, as well as being able to induce disease, disordered or traumatic psychological states, alter weather, or, indeed, draw energy out of a target and \"freeze\" it to death, or slowly load energy into it and cook it, or instantaneously blow up an entire region of an enemy country. The template is a kind of \"scalar magician's\" pentagram, with its 5<1 Mayer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis der deutschen Atombombe, p. 91, q.v. also my Reich of the Black Sun. p. 96. 51 Ibid., see also Reich of the Black Sun. p. 96 221"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"\"JVorkillg ill Fields of Physics that were lWOIutrous 011 a Daily Basis\" incantations and formulas (equations) producing the desired action from a distance trom the system one wishes to influence 52 3. The Implica/iolls of Beardell 's Recolls/mclion of the History of :lcala!' I'h)'sics Thus far, Bearden's speculative history of Soviet scalar weapons development is clear enough, and the reason for Stalin's motivations in pursuing them are clear and plausible. But as I noted in The Giza Death :ltar Deplo)'ed, there was also another source feeding the Soviet interest. This source raises certain questions about the actual Soviet capabilities, and where they actually came from. In his seminal work on the subject of scalar weapons, Fer De Lallce, Bearden states that \"Beside Russia, two other nations - Brazil and (a) 'little friendly nation' - also had developed quantum potential weapons.,,53 A little further Oil, he adds the following very significant details: Brazil implemented an energetics weapons program after it emptoyed the repatriated Dr. Hellmann, a German scientist taken to Russia after WW 11 along with the German radar team.

Also, when the U.S. made David Bohm persona non grata in the McCarthy witch-hunts, Bohm was later employed in lecturing and teaching in Brazil for some time. At the time our own scientists continued to pontificate as to whether they liked or could lolerote Bohm's quantum potential and his hidden variahle interpretation of quantum mechanics. Meanwhile, the KGB weapon scientists and the Brazilian Hellmann project seized upon Bohm's hidden variable theory with alacrity as soon as he published his seminal paper. Those two weapon groups were already familiar with the 52 Bearden is quite clear and consistent throughout his writings that scalar physics can be used in any number of beneficial or malign ways, including the biolo~ical and psychological uses indicated above.

Hellmann was apparently one of the Nazi scientists, a part of a \"radar team\" brought to the Soviet Union in their own \"Operation Paperclip\" style use of former Nazi scientists to fuel their own secret weapons projects after the war; 2. Hellmann disclosed that he had been involved in development of Soviet electromagnetic weapons that could freeze large areas of the oceans' surface, a clear signature of scalar weaponry in its \"endothermic energy extraction\" mode of deployment; finally, and most importantly, 3. Bearden implies that not only were the Soviets aware of Whittaker's mathematical papers and their profound implications, but that the Nazis were as well. This is a clear indicator that the Nazis may have been behind the initial development of the theory of scalar electromagnetic physics and the first prototypical scalar devices and weapons. While Hellmann's claims about freezing vast areas of the oceans' surface sound wild and fantastic, what is even more important is the fact that similar research was undertaken by the Nazis during World War Two into the development of a \"cold bomb,\" a \"bomb\" that would in effect drain the energy from a region 55 This clearly implies a theoretical basis in scalar electromagnetics, but even more importantly, this implies that the 54 Bearden, Fer De Lance, pp. 52~53, italicized emphasis Bearden's, bolMace emphasis added. 55 To the best of my knowledge, the first comprehensive survey of Gennan research into the \"cold\" or \"endOlhermic\" bomb in English was the German Research Project of Henry Stevens. 223"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"\" Working in Fields of Physics that were ,Wonstrolls 011 a Daily Basis\" theoretical and initial experimental research were already begun by Nazi Germany. Thus, the Soviets did not, after all, achieve their breakthrough. They borrowed it from the Nazis. Moreover, as was indicated in Reich of the Black Sun, the Nazis had expressed an interest in Dr. Nowak's \"molecular bomb\", a bomb of great explosive power brought about by supercooling matter and then suddenly heating it 56 Scalar electromagnetics would be the best and most efficient way of accomplishing both the necessary cooling and sudden heating and explosive expansion of matter. Finally, as I reported in my second book on the \"scalar\" weapon hypothesis for the Great Pyramid, The Giza Death Star Destroyed, there was an event that occurred in early 1943 on the Eastern Front, during the German retreat from Stalingrad, where an entire German regiment was wiped out after the appearance of a strange \"energy bubble\" over the unit. The \"bubble\" exploded all the ammunition in the German regiment, wiping the unit out to a man. As I noted there, the circumstances of this strange event have all the hallmarks of a German secret weapons test of a decidedly scalar weapon, for needless to say, the \"energy bubble\" clearly has all the signatures of a scalar weapon 57 Such \"bubbles\" or glowing plasmas of ionized atmosphere are clear signatures of \"scalar\" weapons at low power usage, as Bearden clearly states: (There) is another incident of a gigantic test of a Soviet scalar EM howitzer deep within the Soviet Union. This is a CIA report, released under the Freedom of Information Act One can be quite sure that the incident occurred as stated. The phenomenon was seen from t\\\\o'o aircraft approaching Mehrabad Airport in Teheran, Iran on June 17, 1966 and reported by their pilots.

The sighting was shielded from most ground observers' view at the airport itself due to an intervening mountain range that masked most of the phenomenon from the ground. The silent, expanding globe was observed for four or five minutes before it faded away. Again, this is positive evidence of the testing of a giant scalar EM interferometer, in the \"midcourse ABM globe\" type of action. However, note Ihe date - mid 1966! The Soviets have Iherefore been testing such scalar weapons of enonnous size and power for at least nYQ decades. This implies that development must have staned at least a decade earlier, or in the mid \"SOS.:58 By \"_midcourse ABM globe type of action'\" Bearden is referring to the ability of scalar weapons to create a highly charged \"bubble\" that would scramble or knock out the electronics of any vehicle or missile entering it. This alone would have made scalar weapons an invaluable prize to the Soviets - or anyone else for that matter - for it would render one's opponent's missiles and nuclear warheads so much dead and useless mass, and accordingly, give all that much more weight to one's own nuclear deterrent. But this is only a circumstantial argument that the Nazis were after scalar weapons. To make such a case stronger, one would have to find evidence that Nazi scientists and their conceptions were the feedstock to this Soviet scalar weapons project. Bearden confirms the worst by offering the following infomlation: One of my close colleagues has validated that the German radar learn had some severe instrumental anomalies while still in Germany. We think this is what they were: In W\\\\'l1 the Germans invented radar absorbing materials, to coat their submarine snorkels and prevent Allied antisubmarine warfare bombers from tracking the snorkels and destroying the subs. A wide variety of highly nonlinear, doped materials \",'ere investigated. In addition to single beam radar cross section, the Germans also examined the materials in multi-beam illumination circumstances. It appears that, in some multibeam experiments with some materials, conditions were just right so that the multi-illuminated absorbing material acted as a pumped phase conjugate mirror (PCM), and wave-to-wave interactions emerged. This meant that \" Bearden, Per De Lallce, pp. 266-267. 225"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"\"Working in Fields of Physics that were Monstrous on a Daily Basis\" the absorber material peM would suddenly gatber up all the energy in the pumping beams, use one of the otber beams as a signal input beam, wrecking the experiment and creating ha,'oc in surrounding equipment. When the German radar learn went to Russia, their knowledge of these anomalies went with them. In the desperate Russian scientific climate to find just such anomalies, this startling and anomalous phenomenon would have been exhaustingly examined and studied, once the German radar engineers got to Russia to their new laboratories. In short, it appears that the Russians quickly came up with what today is called \"nonlinear phase conjugate optics,\" but first in the radar band rather than optics. So before 1950, it appears that the Russians already had working pbase conjugating pumped phase conjugate mirrors for the radar bands and in other bands.\" Now observe carefully the implications of Bearden's remarks. First, the phenomenon of phase conjugate mirrors was a direct result of late war German radar experiments on highly non-linear radar absorbent materials (RAM) that they had invented during the war for their V-boats.6() This is as much as admitting, in a round about fashion, that it was not the Soviets that came up with it, but the Nazis. Secondly, it is to be noted that Bearden clearly implies that the Nazi radar team stumbled across the phenomenon accidentally. We shall offer evidence - when we turn to a consideration of the speculative physics of the Bell itself - that the Nazis were not blindly stumbling about in quest of a breakthrough, but rather, pursuing all available means to acquire scalar technology and weapons. Their discovery was therefore not accidental. They were looking for it. Thirdly, if it is the case that the Nazi radar team's observed anomalies were merely the result of happenstance, then there is an implicit contradiction between Bearden's remarks here, and my earlier remarks implying that both the Soviets and the Nazis were surely aware of E.T.

In other words, if Bearden's case that the Soviets developed scalar weapons is based upon (I) Strange installations or devices having no conventional explanation; (2) Strange effects being observed that can only be signatures of a scalar physics and its associated technologies; (3) The crucial role of wave-mixing on non-linear materials such as in the late war German radar experiments; (4) The equally crucial role of rotating non-translational vorticular systems in scalar physics theory; (5) A speculative reconstruction of the history of scalar physics based upon probable reconstructions of forgotten physics papers such a Whittaker's, surely known to the Nazis as well as the Soviets; and, (6) Research and Review Institutions or \"think tanks\" in the Soviet Union scouring western physics journals for an area for breakthrough and weaponization into a post-nuclear super-weapon, then by the same token, and as should be now equally apparent, all these things are equally true of the wartime situation of Nazi Germany, and clearly signatures of Kammler's special \"think tank.\" But one must go further than this: every observed effect oj scalar devices finds an earlier echo in events during the Second World War, and the only known experiments that could be construed as having scalar characteristics were conducted by the Nazis. In my opinion then, this means that the case for a Nazi origin of scalar weapons is much stronger than for a Soviet one. So, might the Nazi radar team's experiments have been deliberately looking for such an effect? Might the radar team have been yet another component of the same project represented by the Bell? While there is no direct evidence, there are a number of factors that would seem to argue persuasively that this is indeed the case. To understand why, we need only look more closely at the Nazi radar absorbent material itself, and what the radar team 227"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"OJ IVorkillg ill Fields of Physics that were JWoIIstrous 011 a Daily Basis\" was initially looking for, and the theory of radar that it implied the Germans were working with. As we shall see, it is a theory profoundly di fferent from the standard theory of radar as a \"bounce\" of a signal from a reflecting target. As was described in Reich of the Black Sun, some of this radar absorbent material consisted of rubber, into which small iron and zinc balls of speci fie diameter had been pressed during molding. These balls were resonant to certainfi'equencies known to be used by British and American radar. In the earliest materials, only certain frequencies would be \"absorbed\" by the material. The Germans knew that eventually the Allies would change their frequencies, and thus the material would be useless. Hence it became necessary that the newer radar absorbent material be absorbent to a wider band of frequencies, and hence the need to test several frequencies on this material. But now notice that the German team is intel/ering several beams of different frequencies on this material. This means, in short, that they have realized two things that are not part of the theory of radar in any standard text to this day: (1) that radar is not a \"bounce\" as much as the target itself is a \"secondalY transmitter\" resonant to certain frequencies. The radar signal thus stimulates a current within the target via resonance, and this then is transmitted back to the radar antenna where the amplifier amplifies it; (2) by interfering several frequencies on the same target composed of radar absorbent material capable of absorbing di fferent frequencies, they are trying to determine if nonetheless a secondary transmitter effect results, nullifYing the material's stealth properties. In short, this means that they were expecting some sort of \"anomalous return\" to their antennae. What exceeded their expectations, in other words, was not the result, but its intensity. This further implies that they might also have been aware of the role of longitudinal waves as a means to ach ieve the phenomenon. To sum up, the nature of the experiment's configuration suggests that the Nazis were well aware of \"scalar physics\" and its peculiar properties, for they clearly perceived radar as a \"resonance-and-secondary-transmitter\" effect, and not merely a \"bounce.\" In other words, even to have conceived of such an experiment, the Nazi radar research team had to have known that 228"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell all material, including highly non-linear material, has a resonance.

In other words, Freya had three sending antennae, one of which doubled as a receiving antenna. This system is somewhat obscured in the schematic of the drawing, which, if one studies it closely though, also indicates that the radar unit's two \"side\" antenna are sending pulses. Why is this three-antenna sending system so important? And what does it have to do with scalar weapons? First, such plural sending antennae would have been necessary for a simple, prototypical phased array radar. If each antenna sends out a pulse slightly out of phase with the pulses from the other antenna, the result is that the signal of the whole apparatus can be caused to 230"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell \"bend\" or \"shape\" itself in a certain way, and bence, one can bend the signal to look \"over the horizon.\" But as has been noted already by Col. Bearden, the other thing such radar sets can do is interfere electromagnetic waves on non- linear material, creating the longitudinal or scalar wave in the medium. Thus, such radar devices are potential proto-typical scalar weapons, as the following diagram of Bearden of a scalar device sending out two pulses, not only out of phase but indeed, at different times and velocities. The pulses only overtake each other on the target, producing the longitudinal wave: Bearden's Diagram of a Scalar Weapon Pulse As any cursory examination of Bearden's diagram with the wartime German schematic of Freya will attest, there is little basic conceptual difference between the two types of operation. While this is not to suggest that Freya was a scalar weapon, it is clear that such phased array radars constitute the first elements in such a system, for by simple reconjiguration, one may advance ji-om the idea of out-aI-phase pulses to out-aI-phase pulses jired at dijJerelll times and arriving 011 target at the same lime.

An Odd Allied Intelligence Reporllndicating Ihe Nazi Operation of Scalar Weapons The destruction of a German regiment on the Russian front in 1943 by what appears to be a scalar weapons test 61 remains speculative.

He counted up to 30 planes. They were flying in close formation. While PW watched them pass by, he saw what he believed to be a small fighter plane (grey color, no identification marks) climb and approach the Allied fonnation from an easterly direction. PW states that the \"fighter plane\" was flying at abnormally high speed at that it 61 Georg, Star Wars, p. 116.

At that point, successful delivery of an a-bomb to any Allied strategic target could only have been accomplished by a Luftwaffe bomber, since the V-2 and V-I would not have had the ability to lift such a heavy weapon, nor the range to deliver it to any worthwhile Allied target. Hence, the last anecdote makes sense. But it is the first story that contains the reason for keeping this document under wraps for so long. Notably, two elements are not \"pure fantasia,\" since the Messerschmitt 163 \"Komet\" was in fact a small rocket plane capable of great speeds. Moreover it had a distinctive shape that, once an individual had seen one, would have allowed it to be readily identified. So this element rings true. The second element that is not \"pure fantasia\" is the \"cloud\" apparently fired by the \"fighter plane\" at the Allied formation. This has all the hallmarks of the \"Kugelblitz\" system first detailed by Renato Vesco, a gas that was used to ignite or neutralize Allied ignitions. But here the connections to known German secret weapons projects end, for the \"cloud\" then behaves in a most un-gas-like manner. [t neither explodes, nor do the Allied planes' ignitions explode or simply stop. There are no planes falling from the sky, no crashes on the ground, no debris, no nothing. However, the signatures of the \"gas cloud\" are remarkably similar to the glowing globes that apparently annihilated a German regiment on the Eastern Front in 1943, and remarkably similar as well to similar globes spotted by various pilots near the former Soviet Union and adduced by Bearden as demonstrations of scalar weapons systems by the Russians. 66 The report is clear: the Allied planes simply '\" See my Giza Deorh Srar Deployed. pp. 109-111.

So we have, from an unlikely source, yet another indicator that Nazi Germany most likely was developing scalar physics and scalar weapons as a component of its most sensitive and secret weapons projects. 4. Conclusions and A Post-War Scalar Postscript: the \"Scalar Weapons\" Nations and Germany It is significant that Bearden initially maintained that in addition to the Soviet Union there were three other nations possessing scalar weapons. More recently, Bearden maintains that A friendly little foreign nation does have such weapons including (quantum potential) weapons that operate in multiply connected spacetime .... That little nation has been responsible for our continued survival and has continued to deter the planned KGB Strategic energetics strikes upon the West. There are indications ... that at least one - and possible two - other friendly Western nations also possesses 67 such weapons. One can only surmise - though it is rather obvious - that the \"friendly little nation\" Bearden refers to is Israel. The reason why it most likely is Israel requires some explanation. In my second book on the Great Pyramid Weapon Hypothesis, The Giza Death Star Deployed, I argued that tbese three nations were most likely France, Japan, and the then West Gennany.68 As argued there, West Germany would have pressing geopolitical and military reasons for developing such weapons, since it could never hope to offset the American and Russian - not to mention French and British - preponderance in nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, even if it chose to develop its own atomic 61 Bearden, Fer De Lallee, pp. 15-16 68 Q.v. Joseph P. Farrell, The Giza Dealh Star Deptoyed, pp. 99-104. Bearden makes the astonishing, and quite disturbing, assertion in Fer De Lance that the notorious Japanese yakuz3 - the Japanese \"mafia\" with its own neo- fascist and nco-imperialist ideology - has recently acquired scalar weapons. In effect, this means that Japan has, since the yakuza is intimately connected to the mainsprings of Japanese economic and governmental power. 236"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Tlte SS BrollterJlOod of lite Bell and hydrogen bombs. Additionally, West Germany had outstanding treaty obligations against the development of atomic weapons 69 Scalar weapons were not covered in these treaties, and thus afforded the fastest and cheapest method for Germany to acquire strategic weapons that would level the super-power dominated playing field. Their existence in the contemporary German arsenal would also explain two recent events: first, the recent decision of the German government to take all of its nuclear power plants out of commission, since the \"left over plutonium\" would no longer be needed for any bombs;7o and secondly, the sudden \"reunification\" of the two Germanies after a series of devastating earthquakes hit the Soviet Union in 1989 71 In other words, Germany may have sent the weakened Soviet Union a clear \"scalar message\" not to interfere in the reunification. 72 But all these were merely circumstantial arguments and speculations. Is there any hard evidence to suggest that Germany actually is one of the early \"scalar weapons\" powers? 69 In the previous book on Nazj Secret weapons, however, I mentioned that it is my srrong belief, based on the evidence presented in Zdenek Cervenka's and Barbara Rogers' book The Nuclear Axis: Ihe Secret Collaboration Between West Germany and SOli/II A/rica, documenting that it was in fact West Germany that was Ihe technological source behind South Africa's and Israel's developmen! of the atom bomb. 70 Of course, this is not the official Gennan government explanation for its decision. The official explanation is coucbed in the politically acceptable currency that the decision was taken for \"environmental reasons.\" This is not to say that this was not a genuine factor in the Gennan govenunent's decision, but only to say that it was probably not the ultimate motivation. 71 Earthquakes, it will be recalled, are a signature of the use of a scalar weapon in its lowest thresholds of destructive potential. 72 That Germany seems the obvious choice only requires a moment's reflection. Other than Russia. one cannot honestly maintain that France or Great Britain would have been in a terrible hurry to see Germany reunified. Japan. China, and the U.S. would have been most likely indifferent to il. Israel would have been implacably hoslile bul probably ultimately acquiescent, and South Africa apathelic or perhaps mildly hostile. Only Brazil may have had some sympathy for the reunification, given its own rc-liance on Gennan scientists in its own scalar program. But in the final analysis, if those unusually destructive earthquakes were induced, then the finger points to scalar weapons, and to Gennany, as to no other. 237"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"\"Working in Fields of Physics that were Monstrous on a Daily Basis\" Indeed there is, and it comes from Bearden himself. Very early on in his research, Bearden \"upped\" the number of nations possessing scalar weapons, or what he called \"Triad\" nations, from three to approximately ten nations: Some 10 nations, for example, now have scalar interferometry weapons, and even the Japanese Yakuza has them and also has their own facilities for producing them in Japan, including small portable units developed for use in assassination and terrorist type warfare within a targeted nation - the United States of America.\" For now the enormous implications of an independent criminal syndicate possessing such weapons must be put aside. We shall return to the subject when we consider the problem of independent Nazi survival and continued independence of their black projects. For now, it is to be noted that the number of \"scalar deterrent\" nations has considerably expanded, and this in tum leads us to consider the South African, Israeli, and West German a-bomb program. Indeed, Bearden himself points the finger in this direction: According to (syndicated newspaper columnists Jack) Anderson and (Lee) Van Alta, a South African navy contingent was \"in the area\" (of the test) at the time of the 1979 Vela (satellite) detection, and Israel and South Africa were cooperating on an atomic bomb project as early as 1966. Apparently U.S. announcement of an impending South African atomic test in the Kalahari Desert in 1977 led to such outcry that the test was suspended. Anderson and Van Atta cite succeeding visits to South Africa by Israeli scientists, technicians, and defense officials. However. since the actual Vela detec/iolls showed some deviations from what would be expected fi\"om nuclear tests, one can speculate that Anderson and Van Alta have presented evidence/or the development of scalar electromagnetic weapons by fwo additional countries,74 One may further speculate that this could reveal what has been checking the Soviets from simply moving against the West with scalar electromagnetic weapons. 7S 73 Bearden, Fer De Lance, p. 35. 74 Namely, Israel and South Africa. \" Bearden, Fer De Lance, pp. 353-354, emphasis added. 238"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell While columnist Jack Anderson knew that there was a hidden \"third partner\" in the Israel-South Africa project, he was never able to pin down who it was with any certainty. But with the research of Zdenek Cervenka's and Barbara Rogers' book The Nuclear Axis: the Secret Collaboration Between West Germany and South Africa, we now know that this hidden partner was West Germany. Thus, if Bearden is correct, that the Vela satellite detected not an atomic explosion, but an explosion brought about as the result of a scalar weapons test, then the conclusion follows that Germany was, from that point on, a \"scalar weapons power.\" If this is the case, then one is confronted with a disturbing pattern, for it would appear that scalar weapons research was begun by Nazi Germany at some point prior to or during the World War, and essentially continued by the same personnel - in various countries and at their expense, including Germany itself - after the war. This in tum permits one to speculate that perhaps all these disparate \"scalar weapons\" projects and its \"not for public dissemination\" physics were coordinated from some hidden center. ln any case, we are now in a position to summarize why Bearden's historical reconstruction of the development of scalar weapons must be amended to show their origin, not in post-war Soviet programs, but in wartime Nazi Germany's secret weapons black projects. (a) First, there are the references to Nazi Germany's interest in building a \"cold bomb,\" and Hellmann's assertions that the Soviets were constructing a weapon to freeze portions of the ocean. Such \"endothermic\" weapons are clear signatures of a scalar weapon being used in its mode of extracting energy from a distant point. (b) Secondly, there is the report of the annihilation of a German regiment by an \"energy bubble\" on the Eastern Front during World War Two. As was indicated, this too is the signature of a scalar weapon in yet a different mode of deployment.

(d) Founhly, there is the presence of one of the chief scientists involved in these radar and scalar weapons projects, Dr. Hellmann, both in the German, Soviet, and subsequent Brazilian programs. Taken together these things outline a strong circumstantial case that Nazi Germany was the true origin of scalar weapons, and that during the war the Germans were indeed \"working in areas of physics that were monstrous on a daily basis,\" pursuing the ultimate planet busting doomsday weapon. And significantly, it appears that West Germany, at least, vigorously pursued such weapons after the war 76 76 This permits another speculative reconstruction of history. It is known that Chancellor Adenauer agreed to re-aml West Germany and undertook by treaty with the United States, France, and Great Britain, not (Q build atomic, biological, or chemical weapons on Gennan soil as a condition of re·annamenL ,\"Vhat is liule knovro, of course, is that Adenauer made it very clear to the other Western Allies that Germany, as a sovereign nation, would not hesitate £0 develop such weapons if the international situation required it. Might the motivations for Adenauer's acquiescence, then, have been that the West Gennan government already knew of the possibility of weapons far more destructive and far cheaper than atomic and themlOnuclear weapons? Clearly it did, for it strains credibility to think that with so many former Nazis in his government, not to mention General Reinhard Gchlcn's extensive left-over-from-the war spy network, that they were totally oblivious to the possibilities, nor oblivious to tbe accomplishments ofSS General Kammler's black projects \"think tank.\" It likewise strains credibility that any self-respecting German government would rely on [he good graces of Britain, France, or [he United States to ensure its security.

But in the aftermath of the war and the advent of the nuclear age, particularly after the Soviet Union acquiring its own atomic and hydrogen bombs, the need for some sort of defense against them became immediately felt. One of the first efforts to improve on the \"burst\" devices came in 1957, with a patent from the Gennan Siemens firm - US Patent Number 2,904, 692, by inventor Wilhelm Gscheidlen - for the collimation of gamma rays by means of a series of metal baffles with pin-hole sized holes, arranged sequentially, to achieve a lensing effect that would concentrate high frequency gamma photons into a beam, using a cobalt 60 source J But as Vassilatos notes, \"such systems lost much of their initial energy before passing through the multiple baffles of the collimator itself. Ultimately, these pinhole camera systems failed from inherent problems of fundamental incoherence from the source itself, an intriguing engineering problem requiring the discovery of new phenomena for its solution.'''' That is, the sources of gamma rays in these systems was rather like a light bulb, emitting gamma rays of various frequencies. No matter how efficient the collimator baffle system, the beam would still spread out - like a \"gamma ray flashlight\" beam - and thereby lose much of its energy. The goal was for gamma ray coherence, a gamma ray laser whose awesome power can only be appreciated by comparison to ordinary optical lasers, which can cut through steel with ordinary ligbt. The next step was taken in the early 1960s, with so-called Clear Atomic Light\" systems, which relied on a system of underground tunnels and a reflecting mirror able to direct the light generated from a nuclear explosion to tbe surface through a tunnel in a concentrated beam. Such systems, in other words, took the radiation from a nuclear explosion and directed it in a beam. Needless to say, using the weapon also destroyed it, since they could never be more than one shot affairs.

These experimental weapons were part of PROJECT DEFENDER, the original Star Wars Defense Initiative of President Eisenhower. This Project investigated the use of directed hOI nuclear plasmas (PROJECT CASABA), high energy particles (PROJECT HOWITZER), and primary experimentation with X and Gamma Ray LASERS' These CAL or Clear Atomic Light systems quick.ly moved out of their underground tunnels and bunkers and became more portable, and potentially space-based, weapons platforms. The well-publicized X-ray laser systems of the early 1980's were based on these early CAL systems, the small nuclear device being housed in a hemispherical or \"tanklike\" structure surrounded with rods of radioactive material. When the device is detonated, the rods become transmitters of deadly cohered, or lasing, x-rays, incinerating anything in their path almost instantly. Given that a beam of enormous diameter can be constructed with such a device, \"one is able to produce\" a high frequency, high power x-ray laser beam \"for the specific purpose of destroying missiles or cities alike. The length of the rods employed determines the amplification factor.,,6 These weapons would have the additional advantage over more indiscriminate hydrogen bombs in that they would leave no residual radioactive fallout in their targets.? Thus, the engineers and scientists in America's black projects were confronted with two unpleasant facts. On the one hand, the older \"electrical burst\" method of generating such intense beams - the method pursued during the World War, while providing intense rays, also required the construction of enormous installations to generate the rays, thus rendering them impractical as weapons. On the other hand, x-ray lasers were deadly, of sufficient power to be used in an offensive strategic mode, and were far more efficient 'Vassilatos.

But they could only be used once, since firing the weapon also destroyed it. Yet another problem attended the pursuit of X-ray and gamma ray lasers (gamma ray lasers are often called GRASERS). Since these high frequency radiations (gamma rays are much higher frequency than x-rays and hence pack even more of a punch) were able to permeate almost all forms of matter, creating an optical cavity to achieve coherence (the action that makes an ordinary laser beam) for these frequencies was difficult. Ordinary mirrors and lenses did not effect x-rays or gamma rays. The quest, in other words, had turned to reusable and \"portable\" x-ray and gamma ray lasers, for obvious reasons: \"Becoming operative at the flick of a switch, these weapons represent potentially more of a threat than a single strike nuclear warhead. Any single electronuclear weapon can be fired repeatedly, the equivalent radiant firepower of several warheads.\"g One method was quickly found, employing the plasmas created by sudden vaporization of heavy metals with ordinary optical laser light. Once having created a plasma of such material, this in tum was then pulsed with lasers to create an amplification and cascade effect that resulted in X-rays and gamma rays approaching coherent, or lased, nature 9 \"These 'Z-Pinch' plasma devices fire beams easily capable of melting clean holes directly through thick walls of metal and stone.\"IO J. Enter the Mossbauer Effect It is in the search for reusable X-ray and gamma ray lasers that one encounters a physical effect that might bear directly on the physical and theoretical thinking behind the Bell. The effect is known as the Mossbauer effect, and it concerns the relationship of acoustic and inertial stress and the effects of these on the gamma lasing activity of radioactive materials.

Mossbauer found that he could stimulate his isotopes inlo a supersaturated stale by continually supplying them with the requisite quanta. Brought to a state of supersaturation, Mossbauer observed the sudden release of gamma ray bursts several orders in magnitude greater than the input. Furthermore, when properly directed, the gamma burst came as a single coherent emission. Mossbauer had found the means for creating a true gamma ray LASER. After Rudolf Mossbauer discovered the primary aspects of his strange effect, otbers began discovering its ancillary phenomena ..... Some experimenters disovered that the mere prox.imity of gamma absorbent matter near a gamma isotope source effectively modified the source, an anomaly. The coherent gamma emissions of Mossbauer resonant stimulations were strangely linked to their absorbers, a relationship modified by motion alone. Special radioisotopes were rotated on special high speed rotors, demonstrating a phase modulation effect... Slotted shields were made 10 rotate at high speed between isotope sources and absorbers, adding evidence that phase shifts were indeed occurring .... These findings strongly suggested the possibility of directly modulating Gamma Ray streams by movement alone .... (the) mere application of stress on the isotope samples was found to produce successions of powerful gamma ray bursts. Here was an unexpected \"piezonuclear\" corollary to the Mossbauer Effect. Isotope samples were applied to loudspeaker cones, and physically vibrated in the presence of absorbenr materials ... .Indeed, certain experimenters discovered a strange effect of vibration upon the isotopes themselves. With applications of increasingly high pitch, the loudspeaker-fixed isotopes produced continual bursts of coherent gamma ray energy. Here was evidence that the mere compression of specific isotopic material could produce an intense gamma supersaturation. What had been observed constituted an avalanche process, one capable of organizing coherent gamma emissions. The application of audio signals (400 cps) caused remarkably intense gamma emission in these isolOpes. It was soon found that ultrasonic vibrations produced staggering gamma emissions .... A growing wave of gamma photons is thus both stimulated and driven along by compressional waves alone .... 246"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Tile 55 Brotller/lOod of tire Bell Researchers who studied the compression phenomenon may not have been prepared for the resultant gamma yield when shock impact was applied to the isotopes. Huge coherent gamma ray bursts were produced throughout the smal] isotope core, a radiance which may have produced the first uncontrolled gamma ray '''event'': an explosion of pure and penetrating gamma superradiance, The development of gamma burst \"explosives\" has well remained completely shrouded in secrecy.11 What emerges from the Mossbauer Effect is that abrupt shock - acoustic or otherwise - of certain radioactive isotopes or compounds can cause the emission of radiation to cohere, like a laser beam, giving off deadly effects. One can imagine tben, in reference to the Bell, that if such radioactive material was spin polarized, and then repeatedly pulsed, what sort of deadly effect would result. One might obtain a kind of \"super GRASER.\" Tn any case, Mossbauer's Effect had enonnous implications for the development of strategic offensive directed energy weapons, for the effect made reusable gamma ray lasers a possibility. But there were still obstacles to be overcome, and the one who did it was Josef Eerkens. Eerkens (1962) discovered that the application of strong axial magnetic fields to rod shaped samples (of specific Lanthanides) could produce a more highly coherent organization of gamma ray emissions. A \"superradiant\" beam was found 10 emerge from both ends of such rods. The discovery that gamma ray emissions could be cohered in prcferred directions was yet superseded by methods which actually effected the direction of gamma bursts through a single rod end. Eerkens found it possible to cause the coherent gamma burst to emerge from a designated rod end, by pulsing the rod with gigacycle ultrasound. Producing traveling compression waves in the isotope rod, it was found possible to actually direct the mounting gamma cascade from end to end. The powerful coherent gamma blast was thus capable of being directed, a previously unheard potential. In the Eerkens design we see a true Gamma Ray LASER, or GRASER ... Eerkens founds that the same radioactive materials could be forced to discharge their radioactivity in sudden voluminous bursts when properly stimulated.

(The) frequencies necessary for the control of radioactivity is given as lying between 1 and 10,000 Gigacycles.\" That is, acoustically modifYing and pulsing the environment was the method to stimulate gamma photon cascade and lasing action. In other words, radioactivity is a reaction of an element to its environment. Moreover, the fact that this was achieved acoustically suggests that the effect is a scalar one, since acoustic waves are the 3-space analogue of longitudinal waves in the medium. B. Plasmas. Rotation, Pulses. and Zero Point Energy I. Plasmas and Transmutation There are further connections between the Bell and the strange world of alternative and suppressed physics, this time to one of the most famous names in \"alternative and suppressed\" physics next to Nikola Tesla: T. Henry Moray. Moray, as many know, perfected a device that seemed to draw energy from the active medium. Indeed, Moray spoke often and even wrote a book about the \"limitless sea of energy\" in which we move. And like Tesla, Moray designed his own devices, machines, and most importantly for our purposes, plasma tubes. The later years of Moray's research were dedicated to investigating a peculiar anomaly that occurred on the electrodes within his plasma tubes: Some of lhe electrode metal would transmute 10 another element. It exhibited a nuclear reaction as if the nucleus absorbed a proton or emined a beta particle. Because Moray was secretive about tbis research, linle is known. A clue might appear in Moray's patent; there is one paragraph describing how to make a particular lead sulfide mixture to be used as electrode material. Did Moray discover how to transmute lead into gold? The anomaly regarding transmutation of elements is hard to believe, except that il has been observed over the 12 Gerry Vassilatos, Declassified Patents of the Cotd War and SDJ, section 3.7 248"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Tile 55 Brotller/lOod of ti,e Bell last decade in the cathodes from cold fusion experiments, and these experiments are quite repeatable today. 13 Note here the appearance of nuclear transmutation - via some unknown mechanism - in the context of plasmas, yet another link to Gerlach and the Bell. But there is yet more. Engineer Ken Shoulders made a significant discovery. Shoulders figured out a way to launch a kind of \"coherent plasma\" that is simply a \"cluster of charges predominantly of one polarity,,,14 that is, Shoulders came upon the same principle of spin coherence, as exhibited in dle Bell, since charge is a phenomenon of spin, of vortices. When such a \"cohered plasma\" strikes an aluminum plate, scanning by electron microscope reveals that the tiny crater made in the metal by the plasma impact results in \"transmuted isotopes\" that are \"unusual and rarely found in nature.,,15 Moreover, one may easily see that such processes might be identified - somewhat loosely to be sure - as \"photochemical,\" confirming the possibility that similar processes or phenomena were discovered by the Germans during the war, and giving rise to the baffling \"photochemical\" statements of isotope enrichment in the Farm Hall Transcripts. Moreover, the Farm Hall Transcripts made it clear - in Wirtz's statement that was quickly hushed up by the other scientists - that the process involved \"bombardment by a particular wavelength.\" If the Bell was in part being used to research isotope enrichment or element transmutation, then its rOTating operation clearly implies that one aspect of its conceptualization was precisely resonance, or frequency. Since Gerlach was interested in the subject of transmutation, one may safely assume that the Bell was more than an advanced project in field propulsion. It was also an advanced project in the examination of the basic structure of matter and how to transform it. It was thus a project designed to explore the 13 Moray 8. King, The Energy machine of T.

The question remains: what was the basis of that unification? The uniqueness of the Bell is again manifest, even when compared to these contemporary examples, for the Bell, while clearly involving a plasma, and while clearly involving charge coherence or polarization, as in Shoulder's work, involves clearly one other aspect: counter-rotation, and with that, frequency, and the zeroing of electromagnetic vectors to create a scalar potential. 2. FOllr Mysteries and Ion Oscillation According to physicist and engineer Moray B. King, T. Henry Moray himself understood that there were four big mysteries associated with his machine: I) Wha, is the energy source driving the device? 2) How can thin wires conduct \"cold currents\" that penetrate glass? 3) HO\\v can a device pick up normal street conversations from miles away? 4) How can element transmutation occur at low energies? All of these anomalies seem to center around surging or oscillating ions in plasma, a theme that Moray emphasized throughout his book.\" In other words, Henry Moray understood that the four anomalies were connected to \"oscillating plasma,\" that is, to regularly pulsed plasma. But there are yet more possible conceptual foundations to the Bell. 3. Paul Brown's Glow Plasma Oscillator While reading Moray King's The Energy Machine ofT. Henry Moray, I came upon this picture of Dr. Paul Brown's \"nuclear battery\" and was quite stunned at the strong conceptual - and actual physical- resemblance between it and the Bell. \" Moray B.

It was after this investigation that the suppression problems really began for Paul Brown. for it appears he successfully created self-running, =ero-poinI energy device. 17 If this can be said for Brown's device, it is a small step to state the same of the Bell itself, since it operated on principles that, while certainly not identical, were similar.

Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics and Self-Organization In my books on the Weapon Hypothesis as an explanation of the machine-like properties of the Great Pyramid, 18 I touched upon an aspect of the emerging new physics called \"non-equilibrium thermodynamics.\" The physics emerged from the pioneering work of Ilya Prigogine, who noticed the tendency of systems, driven into extreme states of non-equilibrium, to self-organize. Three requirements had to be present for any system to self-organize: I) It must be nonlinear. 2) far from equilibrium, and 3) have an energy flux passing through it. The theoretical models describing the zero-poillt energy fulfill these requirements. Merging the theories of the zero-point energy with Lhe theories of system self-organization open the scientific possibility of activating a coherent ZPE interaction, which could become a basis for new technology.\" As King observes, these requirements \"point the way for inventing a system that could tap the zero-point energy:\" I) Work with a highly nonlinear system like a plasma, 2) drive it far from equilibrium by an abrupt discharge, and 3) work with the appropriate elementary particles which maximize their influence when interacting with the zero-point energy.20 Note what is involved here: plasmas which are driven to a far- from-equilibrium state by an abrupt discharge or pulse, and particles, which, on the view of Wheeler and others - as will be seen below - are but vorticular structures in the aether. Two of the elements of the Bell are involved in this - plasmas and rotation - and, if one recalls the \"beehive-like\" buzzing sound associated with the Bell, a sound characteristic of the rapid opening and closing of high voltage DC switches characteristic of Tesla's 18 See my The Giza Death Star, The Giza Death Star Deployed, The Giza Death Star Destroyed. 19 Moray B.

Oscil/ation of Plasma and ZPE Coherence Thus one arrives at one possible reason behind the Bell itself: If the abrupt motion of a single nucleus can activate the vacuum energy, what if we move a large number together?

All these factors suggest that the Germans were experimenting with the very structure and fabric of matter, energy, gravity and space-time with the Bell, and for various purposes: propulsion, weaponry, and so on. 21 This would seem to corroborate the assertions of William Lyne in his Occllit Ether Physics. 22 Moray B.

First there is the abrupt electrical pulse (which one must assume is rapidly repeated, if the plasma is to be maintained in the necessary state; hence, one has another explanation of the \"beehive\" buzzing sound Witkowski reports was associated with the Bell, since the sound is typical of rapidly opening and closing DC switches). The second crucial element is the \"bucking electromagnetic fields\", and the third is the counter- rotating electromagnetic fields, achieving symmetric compression through rotation 28 If one considers this list very carefully, it will be readily apparent that the Bell's design and operation, as described by Witkowski, contains all of these elements except that of abrupt and repeated pulsing. Even on Witkowski's description and speculative reconstruction of its operation and design parameters, one is in the presence of an intentionally designed quantum coherence device.

The VorticlIlar Mechanics of the Aether: The Theories ofo.e. Hi/gel/berg and Carl F. Krafft There are three laws of any adequate theory of the mechanics of the aether, or of any genuine \"hyper-dimensional\" physics based upon it. These are: I. Rotation; 2. Rotation; and, 3. Rotation. Perhaps this humorous point is overstated, but nonetheless, if there is any single concept that has run as a consistent theme in the previous chapters, from Witkowski's reconstruction of the Bell in chapter four, to Bearden's weaponized scalar physics and our simple schematic explanation of the non-translational, internal stresses of \"scalars\" versus \"vectors\" in chapter five, it is rotation, or, if one prefer the more accurate term: vortex mechanics. But is there any corroboration of any German wartimefoclIs on such a physics, beyond the work and interests of the great Gerlach himself? There is indeed, and, as we shall see, this vortex model of nuclear physics is afully developed theoty, though not, certainly, the mainstream theory. And not surprisingly, the Germans are in the thick and center of it. Two scientists - names carefully expunged from physics textbooks along with that ofNikola Tesla- in particular are involved: O.c. Hilgenberg, and Carl Friedrich (or Frederick) Krafft. The theory may be called \"the vortex aether theory\". In essence, a full theory of a vorticular aether was worked out by Dr. Hilgenberg before the war, complete with alternative explanations of phenomena often adduced as support for relativity. Hilgenberg worked these ideas out in a series of booklets published 29 And these in tum may have been calculated to be in resonance to the ion acoustic resonance of the mysterious \"Xerum 525'°, 257"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":".For Whom the Bell Tolls\" in Berlin: Ober Stromungsversuche mit Sen ken und Quellen. die das Wesen der Schwerkraft grundlegend erkliiren( 1939, \"Essay Concerning Flux with Sinks and Sources, clarifying the fundamental substance of the Force of Gravity\"), 0 be r Gravitation.

J1 Included in the vortex theory are some criticisms of relativity theory, as one might expect of a theory under development prior to and during the Nazi period. Like others, Krafft criticizes the dogmatic mathematical formalism of relativity by pointing out its tautological nature: Regardless of whether the velocity of light is actually constant. it is rendered constant in the Einsteinian equations by the use of variable units of measurement. It is therefore not surprising that the equations of special relativity have met all the so-called \"experimental tests\", because they are in substance nothing more than mathematical trueisms, and any violation of a mathematical trueism is unthinkable.

However, after much searching to obtain copies of Dr. Hilgenberg's papers [ finally managed to obtain a copy of this work, which is dated 1959. Close comparison of this work with Krafft's books, however, demonstrates that the vortex model was fully developed during the war, up to and including its modeling of quantum mechanics and atomic structure.

Positing an aether, Hilgenberg stated a law, in 1931, in opposition to Einstein's emerging \"expanding universe\" theories that were beginning to emerge,J6 which Krafft summarizes as follows: The following is therefore universally true for all media: Whenever a train of waves traverses a medium that has currents flowing across it, an observer who is at rest relative to the source of radiation will observe a diminution of frequency, and a simultaneous refraction of the ray in a direction opposite to the direction of the current it traverses. 37 The assumption of a vorticular structure in the aether as constituting the basis of observable particles and energy also bridges conveniently to the idea of a flux in the vacuum, or zero point energy, for \"if the elementary or subatomic particles are vortices in the ether, then it would be reasonable to assume that such vortices keep the ether in a turbulent and streaming condition.\"J8 As Krafft points out, the vortex model also has another powerful explanatory function in accounting for the persistence of the individuality of any given particle. The most outstanding characteristic of all elementary particles nf malter is their localized persislellce of individuality, and it is inconceivable how this can be explained on any other basis than vonex motion, wave motion, or motion into or out of a center functioning as a sink or source.

Krafft then makes a stunning series of statements whose similarities to the Bell and the type of physics it implies are obvious: If one proton and one electron produces the system of ether current shown in the diagram of the hydrogen atom (above), then many protons and many electrons should produce a similar system of ether currents, but on a larger scale.

Moreover, this theory was based on a very different and very simple conceptual foundation from relativity. And notably, one significant prediction of this theory is that local curvature of space is engineerable and that mass displacement effects are achievable by counter-rotation of plasma. In short, the theory is in radical disagreement with relativity which predicts space curvature only in the presence of very large masses. Additionally, if we assume that the Bell was a pulsed device, then it is reasonable to assume that in the process the Nazis, in their experiments on the Bell, discovered quite deadly field effects resembling the Mossbauer Effect, effects that betoken the scalar physics of Tom Bearden. 265"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"\"For IV/10m the Bell Tolls\" D. Back 10 Mercury Vorlex Engines But there is one last clue that must be examined. It will be recalled that Witkowski mentioned the mysterious \"Xerum 525,\" and that it was his opinion that this was a radioactive isotope of mercury, in compound with other elements: Before each trial some kind of ceramic, oblong container was placed in the core (il was defined as a \"vacuum flask\" ... ), surrounded by a layer of lead approx. 3 em thick. It was approx. 1-1.5 rn long and filled with a strange, metallic substance, with a violet-gold hue and preserving at room temperature the consistency of \"sJighl/y coagula/ed jelly\". From the produced information it followed that this substance was code- named \"IRR XERUM-525·· or \"IRR SERUM-525\" and contained among other COllstituellts the thorium oxide and beryllium oxide (beryl/;a).4J And, as was seen, Witkowski also ends his survey of the Bell with the comment that the Nazis might have been guided in their research from a most unusual source: (Yet) one more issue remains - how did it happen that scientists from the 1940s understood exactly where they were heading? They had applied aOer all ideas from XXI century physics. How is it, that they \\vere conscious of bringing about a major turning-point? \\\\'hal arguments did they lay down (before the launch of work) that caused them to win the race for funds with the great nand influential annaments consortiums? And they won decisively. It seems that the whole issue is something more than just a technical problem.

It is mercury in compound with other elements, for a little way on, the same text indicates that this is a very odd liquid indeed: \"Shaktipaniaraka mani should be placed in the mixture of magnet, mercury. mica, and serpent-slough.\" This suggests that the \"violet-gold hue\" of Xerum 525 might be the result of the mixture of mercury with quasi-crystalline or crystalline elcments, suspended in microscopic flecks in the fluid. The similarity of \"Xerum 525\" to this ancient Sanskrit text describing precisely an unusual form of propulsion achieved through the use of mercury certainly suggests, that at some very high and hidden level, someone in the Nazi Reich was reading ancient texts with a very practiced physicist's eye. In any case, this additional fact makes Witkowski's suggestion of an esoteric foundation to the Bell more credible. But there is one final thing to consider. The late Bill Clendenon, well-known UFOlogist and \"mercury vortex engine\" proponent, similarly stumbled on the ancient Sanskrit vim ana texts, and drew similar conclusions. At the time, some scoffed at Clendenon's ideas, and of course, at the time he wrote his book, MerclllY: UFO Messenger of the Gods, the story of the Bell had not yet become public in the upheaval of post- reunification Germany. And these facts make Clendenon's quotations and analyses (the italicized portions in the following quotation) of the vim ana texts all the more amazing: The Sanskrit SlJIl1arangallG Sureadhara says, \"Inside one must place the mercury engine wiih its iron heating apparatus beneath.\" Inside the circular airjt'ame, place the merclI/Y engine wilh its electric/ultrasonic boiler (J{ the boltom cenrer. 4S David Hatcher Childress.

E. Speculations: the Bel! as a Scalar Physics Device So, gathering together all the alternative notions of the previous chapters, what do we have? One may perhaps speculate along the following lines: I. The basic structure of all elementary particles is that they are vorticu)ar structures in the aether; 2. Mass and \"particle\" or \"system\" individuality arise and are preserved by means of this vorticular motion; 3. Since a vortex which is stable in the plane of the medium (i.e., not drifting in any direction) nevertheless still rotates around an axis, any particular vortex, of any size in any system context, may be said to possess a scalar signature. In effect, the \"scalar signature\" of any system is ultimately vorticular in structure and nature;49 4. Thus, the local spacetime \"medium\" or aether is engineerable and, contrary to relativity, it is not necessary knowledge of the so-called \"Vril\" force, which Illay be seen as analogous to the energy of the aether, or vacuum flux(p. 179), provided Ihal one IInderslands Ihis aether to be of a vorticular structure, Wilh a definite scalar signatllre in particillar zero-summed cases. and as also being the common substrme nol only of energy alld malter, but of mind.

Coherence of atomic spin should thus produce not only mass displacement effects that could be utilized for propulsion, but other phenomena that could be weaponized, since vorticular structures can produce standing waves in the medium; 6. This cohering action might be further stimulated by the use of radioactive isotopes subjected to sudden repeated pulses or stresses of an \"electro-acoustic\" nature, as in the Mossbauer Effect, or a continuous stress by counter- rotation to vector-zero electromagnetic vectors, or some combination of both. I believe that the Bell involved a pulsed aspect of some nature such as this, given Witkowski's testimony of its characteristic soulld; 7. Since atoms are aggregates of vortices, it is similarly possible to conceive of transmuting one element into another by reconfiguring its scalar signature - i.e., its \"aetheric\" longitudinal wave structure. Since vortices are accompanied by such structures, an alteration in the one would seem to imply an alteration in the other, and therefore, in the very structure of matter itself. Altering that wave structure could conceivably transmute any matter impacted by it, accounting for \"low energy transmutation\" phenomena. While the Bell demonstrably fulfills, in so many different ways, the paradigms of the alternative physics examined in this and in the previous chapters, there can be no doubt that the Germans working on it, led by Gerlach, whose brilliant student Hilgenberg outlined the emerging vortex theory, were interested not only in the propulsive uses of their new physics and technology, but also in its benign and malign uses as energy suppliers, and ultimately, weapons of horrendous power.

But there are problems with that viewpoint too, Dot the least of which is that the article is by Gerlach, and that it does occur before the discovery of nuclear fission. Simply put, the transmutation being observed by professors Miethe and Straumreich appears to be induced precisely by \"electrolytical\" methods, since the \"bombardment\" being referred to is expressed 2 Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach, \"The Transmutation of Mercury inlo Gold. :' Frankfurter Zeiling. evening edition, Friday.

And there are other peculiarities about the article not to be missed, and that is the name of the professor supposedly who made the discovery: A. Miethe. Readers familiar with the Nazi Legend of the UFO will recognize the name of Miethe as being one of those allegedly involved with Schriever, Habermol, Epp, Schauberger, and Bellonzo in flying saucer research for the Nazis. Could this be the same M iethe, or even a relation? And finally, does Gerlach's call for \"a larger effort\" to investigate the phenomenon represent the factual basis behind Jan Van Helsing's allegations that actual work in radical field propulsion craft began in the secret societies that swarmed in 1920s Germany long before the Nazis came to power? Whatever the answer to these questions may tum out to be, one thing is clear from Gerlach's article, and that is that he is not thinking in terms of the standard models of transmutation via neutron bombardment that would obtain after the discovery of nuclear fission simply because those models do not yet exist, yet, he is thinking in terms of some form of transmutation via radioactive and electromagnetic bombardment, or rather, stress. Indeed, for Gerlach, whose 1921 experiment in magnetic resonance and electron spin won him the Nobel prize in physics, these results must have set his own mind buzzing with the possibilities of what spin and resonance, under extreme conditions, might be able to achieve, given enough funding, interest, and research. This, I believe, is what must have actually been in his mind. These insights make his final two comments darkly revealing. \"A larger scienti fic exploration is to be hoped for,\" Gerlach urges, \"because there is every indication these authors have made a singular and thoroughgoing breakthrough, especially when one considers the astonishingly low stability of mercury when it is stressed.\" It is the familiar cry of a scientist making a plea for research funding. And given his notoriety and that of the newspaper in which he presents his plea, there can he only one 275"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"\"Gerlach's New Alchemy\" intended target of his remarks: the German government and its many corporate financial backers. But notice the final remark concerning \"the astonishingly low stability of mercury when it is stressed.\" Gerlach here enunciates in a few words the line of investigation he wishes such research to take: subject a high density, viscuous low stability metal such as mercury to stress. And given the context, we know what kind of stress he intends to subject it to: radioactive and electrical. Gerlach has deduced the obvious: if such simple means can cause minute amounts of mercury to transmute into gold, then this must mean that these conditions induce a kind of instability in mercury. And with that, a whole new world of possibilities opened up before him, a world he himself calls \"alchemical.\" Viewed in the context of the previous cbapters, an intriguing and highly suggestive constellation of relationships now emerges. At the end of the story, we have Gerlach (I) heading up the most secret weapons project In Nazi Germany (the Bell); (2) this project by all accounts involved the use of extremely high voltage, given that the device itself had ports for high voltage electrical cabling, given that the Henge pool also had similar ports, and given that Dr. Kurt Debus, an expert in high voltage, was a member of the Bell's scientific researcb team; (3) tbis project apparently utilized some dense and liquid material, the mysterious \"Xerum 525\", that may very likely bave been some isotope of mercury, as plausibly argued by Witkowski; (4) this liquid was housed in lead lined bottles inside the Bell, wbich gave off strong radiations, indicating tbat the serum or liquid may have been mercury highly doped witb radioactive materials; (5) the liquid was rotated at extremely high speeds of mechanical (and possibly electrical) nature; (6) and then was possibly subjected to sudden high voltage direct current pulses, as I Have argued. 276"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood o/the Bell All this is to say that Gerlach headed a project at the end of World War Two that apparently involved some liquid of similar characteristics to mercury which was then stressed, just as his article urged. But at the beginning of the story, we have Gerlach writing an article outlining very similar possibilities for a popular German newspaper, and making a subtle though clear plea for a large scale scientific effort to investigate precisely radioactive and electrical stressing of mercury. Consequently, it appears that someone, somewhere inside Weimar Germany read Gerlach's article, and decided to back his project. The Bell, therefore, may have been a project that by 1945 had possibly already been underway for twenty-one years! In other words, \"the Bell\" represents the culmination of a project begun nine years before the Third Reich even existed. More importantly, Gerlach's remarks also oddly corroborate the mysterious exchange of the scientists interred at Farm Hall who speak of a \"photochemical\" process of isotope enrichment unknown to the Allies, a process evocative of \"cold fusion,,,3 for here in 1924 Gerlach is thinking in precisely such terms: transmutation of a low stability element by subjecting it to high stress of an electrical and radioactive nature. And lest it be forgotten, of all the scientists interred at Farm Hall, it was Gerlach alone who was singled out for the dubious honor of further interrogation by American authorities long after his Farm Hall colleagues had been released and returned to occupied Germany. It was Gerlach alone, of all the scientists interred at Farm Hall, who appeared to be off in his own world of \"magnetic fields separation\" and \"the gravity of local space,\" remarks which, I am sure, must have raised not only the eyebrows of his British captors but also his fellow scientists. But is there anything in the literature that indicates such a \"radioactively doped\" form of mercury might possess some peculiar physical properties? As I wrote in my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, The Reich of the Black Sun, there would indeed appear to be just such a substance: 3 Q.v. chapter 5. 277"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":".. Gerlach's New Alchemy\" But what was the mysterious \"Xerum 525\"? When I first read of this strange material, I thought it might be some radioactive isotope of mercury, or possibly a more radioactive substance in chemical solution of some sort. It is perhaps worth noting that recently a strange substance known as \"red mercury\", or mercury antimonite oxide, has been alleged to have strong neutron emitting properties when subjected to sudden explosive stress, and is alleged to be a non-fissile method of triggering the enormous fusion reactions of hydrogen bombs, as well as being capable, in its own right, of .... explosions in Ihe small kiloton range. Perhaps the Nazis had stumbled onto a similar such substance during the war.'! But just what exactly is red mercury? Is it a powerful new type of conventional explosive, capable of triggering fusion reactions in deuterium and tritium without the need for an atomic bomb as the fuse, as some allege, making a \"pure fusion\" bomb a nightmarish possibility? Or is it, as others maintain, a fanciful post-Cold War hoax? B. MercUlY Pyro-Antimonate, or Red Mercury (MercUlY Antimony Oxide) I. Code-name DOVE Red mercury, or mercury antimony oxide - chemical symbol Hg2Sb207 - enjoyed a short, if notorious, career as the nuclear threat of the nineteen nineties. The story broke more or less simultaneously in various parts of the world, as the mysterious substance appeared to be behind a series of murders in the black market arms trade in post-apartheid South Africa, blocked smuggling attempts in the then recently-reunified Germany, and according to some stories, was even being sought by such \"nations of concern\" as Libya and Iraq as a basis for their own nuclear weapons programs. Then, almost as soon as the mysterious compound appeared, denunciations of the whole substance and subject as a \"hoax\" were issued by the United States Atomic 4 Joseph P.

Illinois: Adventures Unlimited Ptess, 2004), p. 335. 278"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell Energy Commission and various other national and international nuclear regulatory agencies. But one physicist who did 1101 dismiss the story as a pure hoax was the American inventor of the neutron bomb, Dr. Sam Cohen. For Cohen, the possibility of \"pure fusion\" bombs - that is, hydrogen bombs that do 110t require an atom bomh as their triggerS - was brought home to him while he was on a visit to the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories during a visit he made there in the spring of 1958 6 During this visit, Cohen was briefed on a pure fusion bomb project. This device, code-named DOVE, fascinated me. It contained no fissile material; rather, its explosive power derived from heavy hydrogen - deuterium and tritium. Because of its extremely low nuclear cost and its high yield - comparable lO that of a very large conventional bomb - it would in a military application, represent a revolutionary new class of weapons. A device of this nature, having a yield the equivalent of 10 tons of TNT, could kill enemy troops out to hundreds of yards, with no significant urban destruction and contamination. 1 The interest such a device held for the American military was more than just theoretical, for such devices would cost \"roughly one- hundredth that of a battlefield fission weapon, meaning that these things could be turned out by the hundreds.,,8 The theory behind such a device was simple. 5 The reason that an atom bomb is required as a \"trigger\" in a conventional hydrogen bomb is thaI, according to standard nuclear and thennonuclear theory, the enonnous heat and pressures required 10 initiate fusion reactions can only be achieved by an atom bomb, which heats the atoms of deuterium and tritium - heavy hydrogen isotopes with one and two extra neutrons in their nuclei respectively - ... \"ith enough energy to cause enough of them to collide and fuse into helium atoms, with a corresponding tremendous explosive release of energy and burst of neutrons. The neurrons which are not required by the helium atom are \"kicked out\" to form a deadly, but short-lived radiation. Thus, most of the long-lived radiation in a conventional hydrogen bomb comes not from the fusion reaction, but from the fission reaction of the atomic bomb that triggers the hydrogen bomb. 6 Sam Cohen, \"The Dove of War,\" National Review(Deccmber 17, 1995, 56-58,76), p. 56. 7 Ibid. , tbid. 279"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"., Gerlach's New Alchemy\" The most promising approach was to use a large spherical high- explosive charge to concentrate the explosive energy in a very slllall capsule containing deuterium and tritium. In theory, this would cause the desired thermonuclear reaclion. The program proceeded for :wme years and finally was terminated for lack of progress. LlIfer, the Los Alamos laboratolJ' had a go at it. But to my disappo;ntmelll, and theirs. the problem remained intractable. The program ultimately was el1ded. 9 That is, theoretically, it should be possible to take the implosion detonator for a conventional atomic bomb, and instead of using it to compress a critical mass of plutonium to initiate fission, one could replace the plutonium with deuterium or tritium, compressing it sufficiently to increase the energy and density, and hence the statistical probability of collision (fusion) of heavy hydrogen atoms, and voi la' One would have a \"small\" hydrogen bomb without the need of an atom bomb to detonate it. But the effort failed, and it should be obvious why: no conventional explosive possessed sufficient brisance 10 to compress the heavy hydrogen to pressures sufficient to initiate fusion reactions. This affords a clue to what Dr. Cohen is /lot telling in his article: the United States was searching for a conventional explosive of sufficient bursting power that, when used in an implosion detonator, would compress heavy hydrogen to fusion energies and pressures. If such could be found, the atom bomb would become as extinct as the dodo bird, for two obvious reasons. First, if such a conventional explosive could be found, then it could be used as a powerful explosive in its own right, replacing the need for small yield strategic and tactical fission weapons, since it would be far smaller than a fuel air bomb of similar yield, and far less costly than its fission counterparts. Secondly, if such an explosive could be found, then, as Cohen intimates, it could be used as the detonator for a very small, \"clean,\" neutron-emitting hydrogen bomb, or, as Cohen does /lot intimate, as the detonator for the city-and-county-cracking blockbuster strategic hydrogen bomb. In either case, the cost would be far less than a conventional thermonuclear bomb. 9 Sam Cohen, \"The Dove of War,\" p. 56. ,emphasis added. 10 I.e., the energy of the explosive \"shock\" or pressure wave. 280"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"rhe 55 Brotherhood of the Bell However, as Cohen relates, there the story ended, ulltil the crack-up of the Soviet Union and the new Russian Republic's willingness to be more open about its nuclear weapons research. Several years before Livermore began DOVE, lhe Soviets had started their own \"pure-fusion\" development. Unlike lhe U.S. they were quite open about it, claiming it was directed solely for peaceful applications. In 1957, Soviet nuclear-weapon designer I.A. Artsimovich presented a paper in Geneva describing experiments done in 1952, based on the same high-explosive implosion lechoology used in DOVE. He claimed progress had been made. Shortly thereafter, however, Soviet researchers stopped all public mention of lhe project. On the other hand, the Soviet military had no hesitation in writing aboul such devices in their open mililary literature. In 1961, Colonel M. Pavlov, writing in Red Star. discussed almost precisely what I had briefed Paul Nitze on. Pavlov's calculations of weapon effectiveness were almost identical to mine, which were classified. This indicated to me that although the Soviets were not talking about research on DOVE, they were doing it. II Then, in 1992, a Russian nuclear weapons expert revealed details about what the Russians called \"third generation nuclear weapons,\" weapons that could \"double the yield\" with a \"hundredfold reduction of weight compared to existing weapons.\",2 Cohen cites another Russian authority on the subject as stating \"You can drop a couple of hundred little bombs on foreign territory, the enemy is devastated, but for the aggressor there are no consequences,,,,3 for with such weapons there is none of the deadly, long lasting radioactive cloud to drift back over the user's own country in a lethal radioactive fallout. Again, one is reminded of the Nazi's use of fuel-air bombs in their rocket batteries on the eastern front, only in this case, it really is a combination of the phrases \"tactical nukes\" and \"carpet bombing.\" As Cohen explains, the \"doubling of yield\" with a \"hundred fold reduction in weight\" clearly indicates that the Russians were 1I0t talking about standard battlefield tactical nuclear weapons, since even the most pure plutonium still had to be at least a few \" Sam Cohen, \"The Dove of War,\" p. 56. \" Ibid. 13 Ibid. 281"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"\"Gerlach's New Alchemy\" hundreds of grams simply to have enough material to generate spontaneous fission. Below a certain threshold of weight, fission was impossible, and a one hundredfold reduction would make a fission weapon inconceivable. The Russians therefore had to have been talking about a pure fusion weapon, about \"some version of DOVE, based on a detonation technology that doesn't exist in the United States. ,,14 In other words, there were only two options for interpreting the Russians' remarks: either they were lying, or they had discovered the holy grail of thermonuclear bomb engineering, a conventional explosive with enough brisance to compress heavy hydrogen to fusion pressures and energies. And with this Cohen comments, albeit only briefly, on a whole new type of conventional explosive, of which red mercury is but one substance: In recent years unclassified research has been conducted on a new class of materials (including red mercury), referred to as ballolechnics. These materials use a number of elements in low density powder form. When they are subjected to high-pressure shock compression, chemical reactions take place which under certain conditions can produce energy concentrations considerably in excess of those from high explosives. Ballotechnics therefore offer a significantly greater prospect for success in attaining a very low yield pure-fusion weapon than the high- explosive techniques we and other nations have explored. IS Cohen also notes that red mercury was allegedly developed in the former Soviet Union precisely as a detonator for nuclear warheads. Indeed, its efficiency as a detonator was so great that a bomb the size of a hand grenade would be sufficient to blow a large ship out of the ocean. 16 After taking note of the fact that the CIA and various other American agencies dismissed the \"red mercury\" story as a hoax which they nevertheless were taking seriously - \"whatever that means,\" Cohen qui ps l7 - he then says nothing more about it. 14 Sam Cohen, \"The Dove of War,\" p. 57, emphasis added. \" Ibid., p. 97. \"Ibid. 17 Ibid. 282"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell 2. The. 0 I Kiloton Yield Pure Fusion Bomb: The Logic of Fusion Weapons Development But what has all this to do with red mercury and the Bell? The answer is a complex one, and to see why, one should place Dr. Cohen's remarks in the context of a general history of nuclear weapons developments. The pure fusion device represents the last in the various generations of nuclear weapons. One may summarize these various generations as follows: a. First Generation Weapons: This generation of weapon comes in three distinct phases, ascending from the least to the more complex: (I) Radiological Weapons (\"Dirty Bombs \"): this is the simplest type of nuclear weapon, where a conventional explosive is used to disperse a cloud of deadly radioactive fallout over a wide area. The explosion is purely conventional, although it requires rudimentary nuclear technology to produce the required radioactive isotopes in sufficient quantity for such a weapon. This is the type of weapon many erroneously allege was the only nuclear weapon ever actually achieved by the Third Reich; (2) \"The Semi-Fission\" or \"Atomic Fizzle\" Bomb: This type of device actually does generate some nuclear combustion of the nuclear fuel, creating an enormous explosion, though falling short of a full fission reaction. It is a cross between the \"dirty\" bomb\" above and the full fission device below. The explosion, since it does not combust the nuclear material nearly as completely, is also a very dirty bomb. Its yield would be in the fractions of a kiloton, still enormous by conventional standards, but still far short of an actual atom bomb. The atomic \"fizzling firecracker\" effect of such a bomb 283"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"\" Gerlach's New Alchemy\" looks and has the shock wave of a typical explosion, but it is nonetheless a \"fizzle.\" (3) The Pure Fission. or Atomic Bomb: This type of device is the first genuinely nuclear bomb, where a critical mass of uranium 235 or plutonium 239 is assembled quickly enough to emit fast neutrons, which then split the atoms of the critical mass in a geometrical growth of fissioning atoms, producing the colossal explosion of an atomic bomb. The crictical mass is typically assembled by an implosion detonator of explosives surrounding a sphere of plutonium, which is crushed to supercritical density. onetheless, some of the critical mass remains unconsumed in the explosion no matter how efficient it is, and deadly radioactive fallout is always a by-product of such weapons. These are the types of weapons America first dropped on Japan. Note that to achieve this final stage a basic reactor technology, while not needed, is desirable, since plutonium, the most efficient fuel for such a device, can only be synthesized in a fully functional reactor. This will become an important point as we proceed. b. Second Generation Weapons: The next generation of weapons comes 10 three distinct chronological phases: (1) Boosted Fission Weapons: As nuclear technology develops and becomes more proficient as isotope separation and enrichment, purer grade of fissile weapons grade material is produced, allowing more efficient combustion of the critical mass in the explosion, and a commensurate drop in deadly radioactive fallout. Additionally, some neutron emitting material such as deuterium or tritium is \"salted\" into the critical mass, to create an additional burst of high energy neutrons which increase the amount of neutrons in the chain reaction, increasing the yield of the bomb, 284"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell making smaller bombs of higher yield possible. This is the first step towards miniaturizing an atom bomb, as well as the first step toward a fully fledged hydrogen bomb, Atomic bombs of this sort can also be very large, having yields in the several tens of kilotons. It is tllis type of weapon that some allege was tested by Nazi Germany in March of 1945 at the Ohrdruf troop parade ground in Thuringia. 18 (2) Fission-Fusion (-Fission) or Full Hydrogen Bombs: The next step from boosted fission is to make the heavy hydrogen component of the bomb the main explosive punch of the weapon by packing tbe bomb with enough fusion able material that, when the atom bomb is detonated, tile enormous pressures and temperatures created compress this material to such a degree its atoms collide and combine, or \"filse\" (rather tllan split or fission), releasing truly stupendous amounts of energy and free neutrons. Tile yield of tile first exemplars of sucll weapons were in tile tens of megatons (one million tons of TNT equals a megaton, wllereas an atom bomb is measured merely in kilotons, or one thousand tons of TNT). Wllile tile fusion reaction produces enormous radiation, tllis is in tile form of gamma and x-rays and free neutrons, wllich, while deadly, dissipate ratller quickly after tile explosion wilen compared to tile radiation caused by tile atom bomb used to detonate it, wllicll lingers for years. Theoretically, tllere is no limit to tile size of a bydrogen bomb. 19 Tllis type of bomb may bave a second atom bomb added to increase tile yield and radioactive fallout. It implies tile existence of a higllly developed nuclear technology botll to miniaturize tile atom bomb, and to create sufficient amounts of fusionable material - tile Ileavy Ilydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - for a thermonuclear explosion. \"Q.\\,. my Reich of the Black Sun, chapter 4. 19 The largest hydrogen bomb ever tested was done by the Soviet Union. which tested a deliverable weapon with a yield of 67 megatons in 1962! 285"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"\"Gerlach's New Alchemy\" (3) The Nell/ron Bomb: In this type of bomb the atom bomb detonator is made as small and efficient as possible, as is the heavy hydrogen component. The goal is to make the atomic explosion and radioactivity from the fission reaction as small as possible, while making the radioactivity from the neutrons of the heavy hydrogen as large as possible. The blast damage from such a weapon is thus comparatively small, while its radioactive effects are quite large. The aim is to minimize physical damage to buildings, while killing enemy troops. In effect, the neutron bomb is the opposite of the boosted fission bomb. In the latter, the heavy hydrogen is used to \"boost\" the yield of the atomic explosion itself, but in the neutron bomb, the atomic explosion is used to \"boost\" the neutron yield of the heavy hydrogen. The goal of the boosted fission bomb is to increase the explosion; the goal of the neutron bomb to decrease long-life radioactivity and atomic explosion, while increasing short-life deadly neurron radiation. This type of bomb requires the most advanced nuclear technology both in the production of high purity fissile material, the conventional explosives used to assemble it, the science and geometry of assembling the critical mass, and the technology to produce heavy hydrogen or other fusionable materials in high quantity. (4) The \"Salted\" or \"Doomsday\" Bomb: While not strictly speaking a type of bomb in its own right, mention must be made of this type of nuclear warhead. A \"salted\" bomb is simply a fully fledged atomic or hydrogen bomb to which a \"doping\" or \"salting\" of highly radioactive material such as cobalt 60 or strontium 90 has been added. The aim is not only to produce a high explosive yield of maximum physical effect, but also to create a cloud of very deadly and very long-lived radiation to drift over an entire province or region in an enemy's territory. As such, any fully fission or fusion warhead may be \"salted,\" although normally hydrogen 286"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell bombs were thought to be the best for such purposes, since the mushroom cloud from their explosions reach high into the stratosphere, enabling the fallout to be carried over a wide area. These types of doomsday devices obviously had as much repercussion for the nation using them as for the nation being targeted by them. These were the doomsday weapons of the late 1950s and early 1960s. This type of weapon, while monstrous, constitutes an important step for the creation of the third generation of weapon, since to \"salt\" a bomb with exotic isotopes implies the existence of a sufficiently large and advanced nuclear technology to create such isotopes in the needed large quantities. This requires a sophisticated reactor technology. c. Third Generation Weapons: The Pure Fusion, or Pure Hydrogen, Bomb: This is the type of weapon envisioned by project DOVE, and alluded to by the Russian military experts cited by Cohen. As has already been seen, it dispenses entirely with the need for an atomic bomb to set off the thermonuclear explosion. Thus, very \"small\" nuclear explosions can be created whose sole goal is to create deadly, though very short lived, bursts of neutrons over an area several hundreds of yards in diameter, killing all life within it, but causing a minimum of physical damage. This type of thermonuclear weapon requires not only the ability To manuJacture heavy hydrogen in suffiCient weapons quantity, but also a breakthrough in convellliollal explosive to achieve the pressures and energies necessal)' Jor atoms to jilse, without fhe necessity oj an atom bomb Jor the \"trigger. \" What Dr. Cohen mentioned, as has been seen, is a small device with the equivalent explosive yield of ten tons of TNT, what by nuclear terms is a \"small\" explosion. But the idea that such an explosion would cause no physical damage is nonsense. Only imagine what setting off ten tons of TNT in a normal city block would do, and one gets the idea. [n any case, ifsuch a weapon were feasible, then it poses the nuclear nightmare in no uncertain 287"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"\"Gerlach's New Alchemy\" tenns, for one would no longer have to worry about acquiring an atomic bomb, a much more efficient device would be feasible at much less cost. Moreover, with no atom bomb needed, any radioactive effects are very short lived, since the neutrons released by the weapon eventually (and very quickly) run \"out of steam\" and lose their lethality. In short, there are relatively no radioactive fallout consequences to a nuclear exchange. And there is one final, even more unthinkable, danger. It will be recalled that thennonuclear weapons can be made to be very large in terms of their yield, to the tens if not hundreds of megatons. Thus, within the - as yet unknown - limits of the ability of any such breakthrough in ballotechnic explosives, such fusion bombs could conceivably be made quite large. One is confronted with the dreadful prospect of a truly city- (or region-) busting thennonuclear bomb that is not only cheap to produce, light, and comparatively small, but also one with almost no radioactive consequences to the nation or group using it, and almost no radioactive signature that would allow such a device to be detected .. 3. The Red MerclIIY Legend, Recipe. and \"Xerum 525\" We now enter the dark and murky world of late twentieth century nuclear weapons research, a world with its own highly suggestive connection to the Bell, for precisely such a breakthrough in conventional explosives is alleged for the mysterious compound \"red mercury.\" It is therefore worth recounting its legend, the \"recipe\" for its confection, and their possible relationship to the Bell's mysterious \"Xerum 525\". a. The Red Mercury Legend The Red Mercury Legend began in the immediate aftennath of the \"collapse\" of Communist Russia. With the collapse, severa) Russian nuclear scientists found themselves out of work, and out of money, and began to sell Russian nuclear secrets on the black market. One of the secrets was Red Mercury.

Consequently, once again, the finger points back to West Gennany, and nOl Israel, as the real technological broker for South Africa's nuclear bomb development. The implication is clear: West Germany was lIsing South Africa as a proxy state to develop its own nuclear arsenal, maintaining a strict adherence to the letter, while simultaneously circumventing the spirit of irs NATO treaty obligations.

This would explain its extreme density. Likewise readers of my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, Reich of the Black Sun, will also recall mention of the Japanese intercept detailing German research in extremely high density materials such as obtained in certain types of stars, an allusion, perhaps, to precisely such German work with high density radioactive compounds immersed in nuclear reactors.

All these considerations lead inevitably back to the alleged German test of a small critical mass, high yield atom bomb at or near the Ohrdruftroop parade ground on March 4, 1945]7 I. The Claims jar the OhrdrufTest In order to appreciate the significance of the Ohrdruf atomic bomb test for the story of the Bell being developed here, it is necessary to reprise some of the remarks [ made in my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, Reich of the Black Sun, for readers who may not have read that book, or who may not be familiar with the Ohrdruf story. The test was first brought to the attention of the German researchers Edgar Meyer and Thomas Mehner by an elderly German expatriate in Argentina by the name of Adolf Bernd Freier, who shortly before his death, told of the test of an atom bomb on the troop parade ground near the village of Ohrdruf on March 4, 1945, At this point, it is necessary to cite my remarks from Reich of the Black Sun rather extensively, in order to highlight the problems it poses: In any case, the- most problematical aspect of the alleged test of 3n atom bomb by the Nazis in the Orhdruf-Three Corners region of Thuringia comes from a rather specific. and rather startling, assertion. According to Freier. Ihe lest look place on March 4, 1945 at the old IroOP parade ground at Ohrdmr. There, a small scaffold about 6 melers high had been erected, at the top of which a small \"atomic \\ve.apon,,38 was placed. The weapon, according 10 Freier, was \"/00 gUo a mere one hundred grams' This is one of the most significant, and highly problematical. allegations regarding the real nature of the Nazi atom bomb project, made by someone supposedly involved in it, for as will be immediately obvious, 100 grams is/a,. short of the 50 or so kilograms of critical mass needed for a uranium-based at.om bomb. as has been seen. and it is still well below the amount needed for the critical mass for a typical \" See my Reich of the Black Still, pp. 80-86. ]8 \"A-\\Vaffe\". the wording again is not \"Atombombe\" but only A-waJJe. or \"A~weapol1\". 297"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"83. \" Gerlach 's New Ale/rem)'\" plutonium bomb. Yet, Freier is insistent upon this point, and moreover alleges that all the \"slaves\", the luckless concentration camp victims that were forced to take part in the test, within a circle of 500-600 meters from ground zero were killed. 39 This would give an area of approximately I to 1.2 kilometers of blast damage, roughly the effect of a modem tactical nuclear bomb, Such a blast radius would require an enormous amount of the then available conventional explosives, and that amount would far exceed the mere 100 grams Freier alleges for the device. These points indicate that the \"A-Waffe: or \"atomic weapon\" was in fact a fully fledged atom bomb. So how does one explain the extraordinarily small critical mass, especially since the Manhattan Project was aiming for a uranium critical mass of around 50 kilograms? The question deserves serious consideration, for it affords yet another possible cille - if the allegation is to be credited with accuracy - into the real nature of the Nazi atom bomb project. We have seen already that the project was developed under several different and discreet groups for reasons partly due to security, and for reasons partly due to the practical nature of the German program ..... The real atom bomb development occurred far from the prying eyes of Allied intelligence, under the auspices of the Reichspost and more importantly, under the direct auspices of the SS. Thc sccond fact of the German atom bomb project we have likewise previously encountered: its emphasis on what was practically achievable during the war. Hence, while the Germans knew of the possibilities of plutonium and a plutonium-based atom bomb, and therefore knew that a functioning reactor used to produce plutonium for bombs would thereby enable Germany to develop lIIore bombs for the same investment of fissile material, they also knew that a major technical hurdle lay across the path: the development of a successful reactor in the first place. Thus, as has been previously argued, they opted to develop a uranium·based bomb only, since uranium could be enriched to weapons grade purity wi/hoUl the necessity of the development of a reaclor, and since they already possessed the technologies to do so, if employed en masse. Like its American Manhattan Project counterpart, the SS-run program relied on massive numbers of enrichment units to separate and purify isotope. Now let us extend this line of reasoning further. Gennany was also seeking to be able to deploy such bombs as warheads on its rockets. And that meant, given their limited lift capabilities, that the weight of the warheads had somehow to be reduced by several orders of magnitude for their rockets to be able to carry them. And there is an economic factor. Knowing that their industrial capacity would be strained by the effort, even with the help of tens of thousands of slave 39 Citing Meyer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis del' deutsclren Atombombe, p. 298"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Tile 55 Brotllerhood of tile Bell laborers from the camps, another problem may have presented itself to the Germans, a problem illumined for them by their own knowledge of the possibilities offered by plutonium-based bombs: How does one get more bang/or the Reichsmark without the use alplu/onium?

In short, the Germans were already thinking in terms of second generation nuclear weaponry·l And one such neutron emitting source is precisely deuterium and tritium; Thus, \"boosted fission\" would bave afforded the German bomb program a practical way to increase the number of bombs available to them, and a reliable method for achieving an uncontrolled nuclear fission reaction with lower purity of enriched material. It is perhaps quite significant, then, that Freier's testimony concerning the Three Comers underground weapons factories also mentions the existence of an underground heavy water plant in the facilities, for heavy water, of course, contains atoms of deuterium and tritium (heavy hydrogen atoms with one and two extra neutrons in the nucleus respectively),42 And there I let matters lie, without going into further comment on the scientific and historical implications of Freier's allegations. That some sort of atomic test did take place in Ohrdruf seems apparent from the physical evidence of the region: old tree stumps are flattened in a radial pattern from a common center, as if blasted away in a huge explosion. And the region also has the highest background radiation of any area of modern Germany, a background radiation that is anomalous.

But therein, too, lies the problem, for that very small amount of plutonium would require by the nature of the case a very high purity of plutonium. It would require not only a reactor technology, but a rather well-advanced one, and of course, German failures in building a conventional graphite moderated reactor are well-known, as are Heisenberg's own clumsy attempts at construction of a heavy-water moderated reactor towards the end of the war. 43 What all this leads up to is that a third generation 43 The characterization of Heisenberg's notorious \"Leipzig\" experimental reactors as I'failures\" is another legacy and component of the Al1ied Legend. The fact that the reactors caughi fire and were barely able to be put out, in a kind of proto-Chernobyl meltdown, is based on the assumption that Heisenberg was attempting to construct a conventional reactor. But as a close examination of the experiments and aims he was trying to achieve will demonstrate, Heisenberg, like his Manhattan Project counterparts, was \"tickling the dragon's tail\" and attempting to measure neutron cross·sections, all for the probable purpose of obtaining \"the next best thing\", namely, an atomic \"fizzle\" bomb, or \"semi- fission\" bomb. In Ihal respect, Heisenberg's experiments were very successful, and doubtless pointed the way to quick achievement of such a bomb. Such a bomb, moreover, placed in the warhead of a V-2. would 1101 require the heavy mechanism of a cannon shooting the critical mass together, since it could be assembled by the sheer kinetic energy of the impact of the warhead on the ground, thus creating the \"fizzle\" explosion, one much larger than the largest conventional bombs, but ODe still shan of the Hiroshima or Nagasaki atom bombs. Precisely just such a concept is behind German atom bomb designs from that period.

Only such a device is in keeping with the very small weight and very high yield recorded for it. That the Germans had the technology to produce the heavy water for such a device is known.

The Implied Existence of a Reactor Technology: Hartek and Houtermann's \"Cold\" Reactors and the \"Recipe\" Oddly enough, it is the physicist Fritz Houtermanns and the nuclear chemist Paul Hartek who point clearly and unequivocally to the existence within Nazi Germany of some very unusual, and even very refined, ideas for reactors with unusual, and very Gvailable moderators. Hartek had early on hit upon the simple expedient of using tons of dry ice as a moderator in a reactor, a solution that avoided the cooling and energy problems of a conventional graphite reactor and moreover served his purposes well: the creation of large amounts of nuclear waste to be dusted over enemy cities. 44 More significantly, as outlined in chapter nine of Reich of the Black Sun. Houtermanns pointed the way to a methane cooled and moderated reactor. In any case, in both concepts one sees the same principles and aims at work: the creation of a relatively \"cool\" reactor that avoided the problems associated with graphite, and the creation of a reactor for the express purpose of creating large quantities of isotopes.

The question of whether or not the Nazis would have actually constructed and operated some version of either reactor is a moot one, since the 55-run black projects would have concealed their existence quite successfully, as it did with the uranium enrichment facilities at Auschwitz. Given the nature of this program it is extremely unlikely that the 55 would not have attempted from the earliest date feasible to construct and operate a reactor. The existence of the Ohdruf test and the Bell's mysterious \"Xerum 525\" point clearly, if not entirely conclusively, to the existence of just such a hidden and operational reactor technology inside the Third Reich, a technology that, as the existence of \"Xerum 525\" indicates, was used in some very exotic materials engineering. The Bell itself may thus be not only related to such technology, but it is also conceivable that it might, to coin a pun, be at its nucleus.

After all, what little is known of it is known only from one war crimes trial affidavit of an 5S general being tried in post-war Poland for crimes against his own SS, and from the handful of surviving concentration camp victims who worked on the project or in its immediate environs, and who witnessed its effects. And of course, one of its original team members, Dr. Kurt Debus, was subsequently employed by NASA in a very critical position: as a 305"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"\"Gerlach's New Alchemy\"' director of the Kennedy Space Flight Center in Florida. [nterestingly enough, Debus never once mentioned any connection, or gave any inkling, of the existence of a project as secret and as advanced as the Bell. Were it not for the action of the Polisb government declassifying SS General Sporrenberg's - the general who was actually tasked with murdering the Bell's research technicians for the SS - war crimes trial affidavit, were it not for the stories of the few remaining eyewitnesses, and for the efforts of Igor Witkowski, nothing whatsoever would be known of it to this day. But what they do tell is enough, if one follows the technical and theoretical clues through to their modem physics analogues, for they tell of a physics, a technology, a propulsion and a weaponry so advanced and so potentially destructive, that their conceptual basis remains hidden and cloaked behind the \"public consumption physics\" of relativity and an equally if not more severely flawed nineteenth century electrodynamics. Something else altogether occurred in Nazi Germany; some other paradigm was adopted early on and pursued with all the economic and scientific resources and intellectual brilliance that a modern and technologically sophisticated great power could muster. A whole new paradigm of physics - a combination of vortex aether, scalar, quantum-electrodynamic and nuclear physics - appears not only to have been outlined, but conceptually and experimentally developed. And if the speculation introduced here is correct, the Bell may represent a project begun approximately nine years before the Nazis even took power. And the SS murdered its own to keep it a secret. [t stands to reason, then, that no personage, no matter how lofty, would be secure from a similar fate, if he threatened to expose the existence of such a technology or to expose the groups continuing to develop it in the utmost occulted secrecy. 306"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell -Hllfflll Igor Witkowsh's Sketch of the Bell (Courtesy Igor Witkowski's The Truth About the Wunderwaffe) 307"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"\"Gerlach's New Alchemyll \"Myron's\" Sketch o/the Kecksburg Acorn, Allegedly Taken 10 Wrighl Patrersol1 Air Force Base where he glimpsed it. 308"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"~art 'W:bree: ,,'W:be 1Brotberboob\": jfi%l~%{'s jfia}is. jfjfll\\.. anb :M%ljJ'31~-12 \"BAR,VEY (He takes care to be extremely precise.)

A. MAJlc-12 DocumentQlY Analysis Many UFOlogists took their cue from Frank Edwards' bestselling Flying Saucers, Serious Business, maintaining that the early post-war UFO activity was reconnaissance of our military bases, and particularly, of our atomic testing: To this growing list of such \"coincidences\" we should by all means add the following cases: The explosions of the first manmade atomic bombs in 1945 were followed by the appearance of UFO's in numbers in 1949 .... The 1947 mass appearance of UFO's over the United States included numerous sightings around our atomic installations at Hanford and Oak Ridge, as well as the great scarred area near Alamagordo, New Mexico, where we had fired our first atomic device. J This idea was picked up by Stanton Friedmann and others, who maintained the very plausible scenario that E.T. was monitoring our burgeoning nuclear and soon to be thermonuclear military capabilities, as any prudent intelligent society would monitor the military activities of a potential threat. So far, so good, But then Friedmann and others failed to notice the significance of the parenthetical statements Edwards himself makes in the above quotation at the ellipsis, statements J deliberately omitted from the above quotation: [The two bombs were exploded over Japao: the 1946 UFO's were over Scandinavia and Russia. If they were looking for the source of those atomic flashes, they had the right latitude but the wrong longitude.]' But, given the speculative history recounted in my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, Reich of the Black Sun, and the circumstantial case presented in it for German tests of nuclear J Frank Edwards, Flying Saucers.

If \"E.T.\" was indeed monitoring atomic tests and human intentions, then the 1946 \"fly-hys\" over the Baltic and Scandinavia were indeed at the right place. And if one presses the logic a bit more, then it would appear that where the Nazis and their advanced technology went, E.T. and his reconnoitering UFOs were not far behind. Which brings us at last to Roswell, to MAJIC-12, to Col. Philip J. Corso's well-known version of events and his explanation of the \"real origin\" of certain technologies, and of course, to the New Mexico Nazis. While more will be said about Col. Corso's \"Roswell-ET\" thesis of the origin of some technologies typical of the mid-to-Iate 20'h century, it is worth citing his own words here, since they bear directly on the alleged MAJlc-12 documents examined below: My boss, General Trudeau, asked me to usc the army's ongoing weapons development and research program as a way to filter the Roswell technology into the mainstream of industrial development through the military defense contracting program. Today, items such as lasers, integrated circuitry. fiber-optics networks, accelerated particle- beam devices, and even the Kevlar material in bulletproof vests are all commonplace. Vet the seeds for all of them were found in the crash of the alien craft at Roswell and turned up in my files fourteen years later. s The thesis is quite clear, an extraterrestrial craft crashed and was recovered near Roswell, New Mexico, and the recovered extra- terrestrial technology was back-engineered, leading directly to the integrated circuit via the transistor, to fiber optics, to the laser, and a host of other devices and technologies. This thesis must be born in mind as the following MAJlc-12 documents are analyzed, for we shall return to it at the end of this chapter. Drs. Robert and Ryan Wood are well-known for their document authentication efforts concerning the MAJlc-12 \"Cooper- Cantwheel\" documents. Some of these documents they published in a book, which, according to the statements on their own website, 'Col. Philip J.

The curious omission of the mention of any ET Hypothesis as an explanation of the craft's origins can be explained in one of two ways: a. As the document itsel f avers, the origins of the craft are terrestrial, even though its technology is exotic; or, h. The absence of mention of the ET Hypothesis may he a reflection of a lower level of involvement, i.e., it is not mentioned except in the upper echelons of the organization that is beginning to emerge as \"MJ- 12\". A lower level of involvement, however, is itself odd, since by some accounts the recovered craft was slllpped to Wright Field directly from Texas, where it had been flown from Roswell AAFB. Thus, in terms of the internal contents of the document, the stronger of the two interpretations is that no \"ET Hypothesis\" deep cover story is needed. The recovered craft and its technology are therefore terrestrial, though exotic, in origin and nature. 2. Certain statements in the memo, considered individually and collectively, point to a terrestrial origin for the craft, and given the exotic nature of the recovered technology, these can only come from Nazi Germany: a. The craft is \"of such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made aircraft;., that is, nothing about the craft suggests to Air Materials Command (AMC) an extra-terrestrial origin; its size is consistent with the size and scale of human physiology; b. \"The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar. lend belief to the possibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually, automatically or remotely. \" This 322"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Tile SS Brotller/lOod 0/ tile Bell statement can be explained by references to known, tbough exotic, technologies of Nazi secret weapons and their alleged performance characteristics (extreme rates of climb), as well as German progress in remote control of aircraft;8 c.

In my opinion, however, it may simply be due to a observation under low performance conditions. 3. The document concludes with three breathtaking statements that shatter the ET Hypothesis: \"Due consideration must be given the following:- (I) The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin - the product of some high security project not known to AC/AS-2 or this Command. (2) The lack of physical evidence in the shape of crash recovered vehicles which would undeniably prove the existence of these objects. (3) The possibility that someforeign nation has a form of propulsion possibly nuclear, which is outside of our domestic knowledge. \" Note that Air Materials Command, by statements (I) and (3), is not even thinking in terms of a recovered ET vehicle, i.e., nothing about the observed technology is so exotic as to compel the ET explanation. Note also, however, the extraordinari Iy curious statement in item (2), which suggests either that nothing was recovered at Roswell - a conclusion this author rejects - or that AMC has not actually seen what was recovered, or that what was recovered was not actually a UFO. Statement (3) would tend to mitigate against the interpretation that AMC has not actually seen what was recovered in the formulation of this memo, since any number of propulsion mechanisms could have suggested themselves to AMC in the absence of any actual craft to examine. That is AMC could just as easily have proposed magnetic, electromagnetic, or other forms of field propulsion if its conclusions were only based on the reports of the flight perfomlance characteristics of UFOs. Therefore, it is most plausible that AMC had actually seen the craft and based its summary on an actual analysis of its propulsion unit. In this context, statement (3) becomes 324"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell much more significant, since the only other country with a known interest in nuclear means of aircraft propulsion at that time period was Nazi Germany.1I It is to be recalled that one specific area of research of the Kammlerstab was precisely in nuclear aircraft propulsion. Which leaves the statement \"Due consideration nIust be given the following: - The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin - the product of some high security project not known to AC/AS-2 or this Command\" to be explained. First it is to be noted that no mention is made of the possibility of the technology being Soviet. Secondly, it is clear from the statement itself that AMC considers the possibility that it represents a project so black and secret that it is simply unknown to it. This would also allow the possibility that the technology is the product of a wholly independent project. [n short, it allows the idea of a continued and independent Nazi continuation of its wartime projects. 4. These conclusions indicate that AMC is at a loss to explain the actual origin of the craft, though it is clear that it thinks of its origins as strictly terrestrial. Therefore the combined weight of the statements (1) and (3) at the end of the document point to the existence of a program of exotic aerodyne research and development wholly unknown to the USAAF and its premier air technology analysis unil. Ihe AMC al Wright Field. Given that the document nowhere mentions the alleged recovery of ET biology, this tends to support the conclusions reached in Reich of Ihe Black Sun that nothing about the recovered technology or its observed performance characteristics compelled to the conclusion that the craft was ET in origin. Indeed, the document implies the existence of a program, possibly completely independent of the US government, about which AMC knows nothing. \" See the statements of Tom Agoston referenced in my Reich of the Black SlIlI. p. 105.

Again, nothing in the document mentions the ET Hypothesis as an explanation for the origin of the recovered vehicle, even though, as indicated by the opening statement, the question of its origin is the very purpose originating the memo in the first place: \"As requested by your leiter of 16 July 1947 this office has produced its conclusions on the manufacture. function and possible origin of the above referenced subject. \" Indeed, the document is quite clear in its conclusions that \"some nation has reached a stage of flight development in which the present ideas are entirely obsolete.\" If the ET Hypothesis were in view as an explanation of origins, this sentence would have been worded appropriately. And again, it is significant that something about the technology suggested to the Air Force that German Paperclip personnel could shed some light on the subject. The Germans, as has been seen from the chapters in part one, had made great strides in high altitude high performance aircraft. Thus, something about the technology looked \"German. \" 2. Thus, this tends in tum to corroborate the notion that at some higher level of the MJ-12 group a deliberate deep cover story of ET origins is being put out in the documents themselves to conceal what is now becoming obvious: such high-altitude high performance craft were the exotic purview and provenance of the highly classified experimental tesearch being done by Nazi Germany, since it is the only nation on earth at that time to have possessed, developed, and tested such technology. Thus, the implicit implication of this statement is that these projects were being carried forward after the war, independently or quasi-independently, by some unknown entity and in some unknown location(s). 3. The exact methods of this achievement are then clearly specified: \"The designers have managed to offset Bernouilli's theorem that allows the \"total pressure in a flow\" to be less at all points: we can like this to the concept of 'conservation of energy' and their negating friction losses, which would dissipate heat.\" The mention of Bernouilli's theorem suggests that the aircraft was designed for high performance in the atmosphere, most likely in high altitude. Moreover, the brief 329"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"\"The Da)' After Corso: More MAlIC-12 Documents\" and suggestive mention of the conservation of energy and negation of friction losses also strongly suggests German research into suctioning the boundary layer mentioned by Vesco and Childress in Man-Made UFOS, and even more suggestively, to experiments in non-equilibrium thennodynamics, a revolutionary physics concept for that time. These theoretical indicators again point clearly to developments in Nazi Germany, as it was again the only country to have undertaken such research. In this regard, it is once again perhaps significant that the recovered craft was brought to Air Materials Command at Wright Field, where a number of Paperclip scientists and technicians are known to have been employed at the time. This fact suggests once again that something about the craft immediately suggested a Gennan provenance to the American personnel involved in its recovery and analysis. 4. The statement that \"Wing incidence seems to be pre-selected via an in-jlighttrim computer to reduce drag attitude when the wing is at the angle of auack required at high speed and provide stability to lift the weight of the craft\" mentions specifically an in flight computer. This fact may tend to contraindicate our thesis of continued independent Nazi development of such technologies. While it is true that both the Allies and Gennans did develop early digital computers during the war, these were of such bulk and size that the complex calculations needed to perfonn trim computations would have been impractical on an aircraft, even an unconventional one, unless the Germans had also incorporated their semi- conductor technology in the development of much smaller computers for such purposes. While no evidence exists that this was ever done, the fact that both computing and prototypical transistor technology were possessed by them during the war means that it merely remained to combine the two. As has been argued in Reich of the Black Sun, this combining of highly advanced technologies is a signature and favored method of the Kammlerstab. And as was seen in chapter two, the Nazis had made great strides during the war of miniaturizing television cameras for use in guided missiles. Nonetheless, this would 330"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"rhe 55 Brotherhood of the Bell have remained a bulky device, and accordingly, this piece of information argues more persuasively for an E.T. or other exotic origin. S. As noted, the \"Crafi (was) designed Jar high altitude flight. Automatic exhaust orifices were identified. A gyro-controlled wing stabilizer apparently maintains craft in a hover mode. \" The high altitude was again a characteristic of developments by Dr. Lippisch, Dr. Sanger, and others during the war, and the mention of \"exhaust orifices\" tends to support the conclusion that this is a suction or ramjet based craft of some sort. Note, however, that apparently the craft is capable of stationary hovering, a fact that would seem to preclude any conventional ramjet craft. 6. The description of a spherical power plant based apparently on hydrogen fusion fits similar descriptions given in the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate\" and General Twining's \"Air Accident Report\" as discussed in Reich oj the Black SUIl. 12 7. ote that \"the circular wing may have (a) rotating section\" or turbine of some sort. Again, this points to the researches of Bellonzo (as reported by Vesco/Childress in Man-Made UFOs), Schauberger, Fleissner and others in the Third Reich. 8. The \"construction is based on a 6: I ratio\", which is the same ratio as reported in the MJ- I 2 documents examined in Reich oj the Black SUIl. This would tend to argue quite strongly for the fact that we are dealing with one and the same craft. 9. Note that flight control appears to be based on \"optical wave guide fibers similar to glass rods except they are flexible and have a plastic cladding wrap . .. i.e., on fiber optics. Recall that Col. Corso also mentions this piece of technology as being deliberately ET in origin, and recovered from Roswell. 10. The same cannot be said, however, for the final statement: \"Possible television viewing used. \" As has been seen, the Germans were greatly successful, largely due to their semiconductor achievements and ability to miniaturize klystron tubes, in miniaturizing television cameras to sufficiently small 12 See Reich oflhe Btock SlIlI. pp. 274-330. 331"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"n The Day After Corso: More MAJIC-12 Documents\" size and weight to be used as guidance systems on their lighter rockets such as the Tonne anti-aircraft missile. II.Finally and most significantly, it must be noted that this memorandum is addressed to Brigadier General C. P. (Charles Peare) Cabell, who later became Deputy Director of Central Intelligence under Allen Dulles, and who was fired by President Kennedy ostensibly for his part in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. It is also to be noted, as some JFK assassination researchers have pointed out, that Cabell's brother was mayor of Dallas during the assassination, and was instrumental in the last minute change of the motorcade route to divert towards the Texas School Book Depository. We have then, with this document, a clear link from the UFO problem with all its \"Nazi implications\" as exhibited in the documents thus far examined, via Cabell, to the Kennedy assassination. Given that the origin of the craft in no wise is considered to be extra-terrestrial by the document, but rather to have originated with \"some nation,\" we may safely speculate that there is a \"Nazi\" aspect not only lurking in the background of the 1947 UFO flap, but in that of the JFK assassination as well. This UFO-JFK assassination connection is \"corroborated\" in a letter from Timothy Cooper's anonymous source almost immediately. 3.

Robert Oppenheimer was appointed by Dr. Bush to head this project. The project name was coined by Albert Einstein in 1949.

The purpose of the strikes was to take out USSR command and control infrastructure preventing an all out nuclear war. k. During the Cuban Missile Crisis President Kennedy was briefed by MJ- 12 and was told that the EBE deception was the reason the Soviets wanted to place first strike nuclear weapons in Cuba and he therefore restricted U.S. nuclear forces from initiating the GRAND TOUR to bomber strikes. General Lemay was so furious with JFK that he secretly gave orders to SAC to go ahead with SlOP in the event the U.S. perceived a first strike warning from Russia. I. In 1963, JFK sought to eose the uneasy tension by extending cooperation with the USSR in OlJter space investigation of UFOs through a joint moon project.

Everyone believes that a president is in charge of his own office. That is simply NOT TRUE! Presidents can be and are compromised about issues they don't need to know of. The reason is a simple one. It gives them plausible deniability just like CIA directors who are often asked this question: 'What do we know about UFOs?' Once exposed to the data they are changed and are stuck with this problem: 'What do I tell the President?' You can't tell the President without telling others. There is no such thing as a secret in the White House. Just look at the China espionage case. Until he really needs to know nothing will be told him and that is that. This is the real dilemma for those in \"the know\" because the EMEs (extraterrestrial materialized entities) have complete control over UFOs (not to be confused with man-made UA Vs often mistaken for UFOs for they have been around since the 1950s and are operated and controlled by the USAF, CIA and NRO) and can appear anywhere as anything at any time.

MJ-12 appears to have been privatized by President Nixon, in part as a measure to insulate him from being implicated in involvement with the assassination, but, reading between the lines, also in part as a wider attempt to provide completely black cover to MJ-12 and independent sources of funding. Put differently, Cooper's anonymous source alleges a fantastic thing: MJ-12 has grown so powerful it no longer falls under the control of the American government, but has become a private and international concern in its own right, with deep corporate pockets. This is elaborated in three discrete statements by the source: a. \"MJ-12 does not exist as a government intelligence entity. It ceased 10 exist in 1969 and became a private concern financed by big money and big science. \" b. \"The UFO/ERE Working Group is an internalional consorlium financed and sllpported by some of the biggest money institutions and private industrialists in the world. \" 340"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell c. \"In 1969, President Nixon was briefed by MJ-12 on all aspects of UFO activity and the ESE problem since 1947.

These points suggest an independent and very secret development of advanced technologies. Notably the date was 1969, the same year as the first Apollo moon landings. One might therefore speculate on the following scenario: Gehlen, Von Braun, and scores of Nazi scientists and intelligence agents struck their famous \"bargain\" with the American military- industrial-national security complex, and in return, continued not only to pursue their projects, but to penetrate sensitive areas of the very government that presumed to control them, giving them a measure of \"semi-independence.\" In 1969 their influence had grown so powerful, perhaps, that the relationship was severed, and MAJlc-12 became totally independent, perhaps merged into some \"Nazi International\" with deep corporate pockets. 3. Einstein and Oppenheimer were allegedly murdered by MJ- 12 by being \"given cancer\" when they became \"unreliable\", presumably meaning no longer in sympathy with the goals or methods of the MJ-12 group. It is significant perhaps that Jack Ruby, the assassin of the alleged assassin of JFK, claimed that he was being \"murdered by cancer\" injections to silence him. 4.

MJ- J 2 was opposed to this because they felt the militarization of the moon would place the Us. in a dangerous situation with the EBEs who control the dark side of the 11100n. \" In other words, the document gives its own version of the Two Space Programs hypothesis. 5. Kennedy was assassinated for attempted interference with the plans and goals of the MJ-12 group: \"Simply put, Kennedy would have interfered with MJ- I 2 's effort to come up with a defense and a plausible explanation to the UFO/EBE problem and was too sensitive an issue for interruption even by a president. \" 6. The crash and recovery of a craft in Roswell in 1947 and the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls is not coincidental, implying that there is a spiritual dimension to the problem. Moreover, the cancellation of Blue Book after Apollo II landed is connected: \"Was it mere coincidence that Blue Book was terminated after Apollo I I landed on the moon? And. do you think it was mere coincidence that the Dead Sea Scrolls appeared about the same time the UFOs were found in New Mexico?\" The implication is similar to my analysis in Reich of the Black Sun that the Byrd Highjump Expedition to Antarctica and the subsequent allegations he made in the Chilean press are connected to the events at Roswell and to the murder of Secretary of War James Forrestal. Cooper's source is, moreover, suggesting a 16 See Corso, Tile Day After Roswell. pp. 276-332, which reproduces Ihe Top Secret military srudy of a Lunar base called \"Project Horizon.\" It is to be noted that no program of cooperation with the Soviet Union is entertained in the document.

That is the GAME PLAN.\" Thus, even ideologically there appears to be a connection to Nazism, and likewise, to the \"spiritual\" aspect alleged by Cooper's source.

FranklinDRoosevelt DOUBLE TOP SECRET DOUBLE TOP SECRET ~~~~'[END DOCUMENT] ANALYSIS: From the foregoing alleged leiters to Secretary of War General Marshall from President Franklin Roosevelt, we are in a position to draw some tentative conclusions: J. The US retrieved craft with extraordinary technology earlier than Roswell, ca. 1941-42, most likely the alleged Cape Girardeau and Louisiana crashes noted previously. Given that the Nazi projects are at this time nowhere near the degree of progress they would be by the end of the war and after, we may reasonably assume that these recovered aircraft do not originate there. 2. Two conclusions follow from this: a. Given allegations of similar crashes in Fascist Italy ca 1933 and Nazi Germany ca 1936 as recounted in Reich of the Black Sun and elsewhere, it is possible that the US, Italy and Germany were all in the possession of extraterrestrial technology which each nation began to back-engineer. This would square with some interpretations of the off-the-record remarks made by Von Braun and Von Karmann to Twining as recorded by Col. Corso and mentioned later in this chapter and in 350"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell Reich of Ihe Black SUll lJ An important question thus ensues: Why were these nations in possession of recovered craft? It is peculiar that it appears that these three major combatants alone were in possession of this technology. It should be noted that the alleged Halian and German crashes occurred prior to the announcement of nuclear fission's discovery by Otto Hahn in 1938, thus making it possible that this research itself was part of the process of back engineering. Given also that it appears from the data presented in Reich of Ihe Black Sun that Germany was enriching uranium on a massive scale ca. as early as 1940, this may be a possible explanation. b. The alternative explanation is that the crash and recovered vehicle themselves are not extra-terrestrial, but stem from some independent terrestrially based group pursuing its own technological developments and that these vehicles crashed and were recovered by the Germans, Italians, and Americans. They may represent therefore a continuation of the 1890s \"Air Ship Mystery,,24 1n support of this contention the following MJ-12 document should be noted: 8.

Note also that the propulsion unit is both atomic and magnetic - like the Bell - and has some connection to Tesla, implying a kind of field propulsion. (\"Propulsion programs tried to duplicate the atomic power plant found on the aerodyne captured in Lousiana (sic) and integrated the magnetic drive system developed by Tesla.\") These statements corroborate William Lyne's version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis, with his peculiar reliance on Tesla's ideas. 3. Note that the \"S\" aircraft lacks an adequate ejection mechanism for ejection at high altitudes and/or high performance, a problem specifically solved by wartime Nazi research in conjunction with their own research into high altitude high performance ramjet aircraft.

Finally and most importantly, the Air Force apparently developed Blue Book as a deep cover story to cloak the development of these craft and conceal their extraordinary flight characteristics behind the ET Myth as a disinformation operation designed to persuade the Soviets that the US had no such technological capability. This suggests that the nature of the recovered craft in Missouri in 1941 and Louisiana in 1942 were of extraordinary, though terrestrial and unknown, origin. 354"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell 9: Document 10: Edward Teller's Pilch 10 presidenl Reason/or SD/: RECEIVED 12 TJC 3-1 Edward Teller's pitch to President Reagan for SDI 1 wish to bring to your attention of a very rea/(sic) and dangerous situation that threatens not only LIS, the world, but our velY existence as a race. For over forty years I have been involved in developing advanced technologies in the defense of this country which would insure OUf security. freedom, and our fonn of government from surprise attack. As you must be aware, the Defense Department has initiated several space defense programs of vast proportions and at great expense.

Late in president Eisenhower's office, several attempts ~~~=[PAGE BREAKl~~~= -2- was (sic) made to limit further development by prohibiting the testing of space defense weapons. A moratorium was entered into, a \"gentlemen's agreement\" whereby Russia and the United States concurred that testing be halted until further notice. Unfortunately, secrecy and denial has prevented further work of which I now propose. A more detailed proposal is difficult to address in my brief, especially since I want it to be realistic and acceptable. Yet such a proposal is made here, both to give warning of what could happen and to begin a concrete discussion on the Space Defense Initiative program. The Defense Department 355"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"\"Tile Day After Corso: More MAJ/C-12 Documents\" could continue \"classification\" of critically key infonnation of knowledge collected in 1947 and, therefore, its secrecy in its present fonn. Only a small number of documents might need to be kept secret for a longer period, but in those cases a few highly responsible persons would have to certify, year by year, that continued secrecy be maintained. What I wish to impress upon you is the need for absolute secrecy for the real reasons for a space defense. The real danger is the existence of secrecy can not be kept secret for ever. Our scientists will not tum to narional defense unless they perceive an actual danger to the United States. A danger was perceived in 1939, only two years before Pearl Harbor. It is vital to the program that scientists should perceive the danger now, before it is too late. What is at slake is not only the prevention of defeat, but the prevention of cosmic war. Nevertheless, convincing the American people that military research is necessary is a difficult thing. [PAGE BR.EAKl~~ -3- I am not speaking of another anns race, but rather a race of technology. One individual familiar with military techoology and engineering of special intelligence, Dr. John S. Foster, Jr., estimates that in 1960 the United States and the USSR spent equal percentages of their military budgets on space defense and research and development, while in 1974 that percentage was three times as high in Russia as in the United States. The quality of future space defense weapons depends more on research and development than on any other factor; the obvious recommendation is that we should spend more on it. Today we spend approximately 10 percent, so this recommendation does not seem too difficult to implement. Space defense plays important roles in military affairs, particularly in communications and intelligence gathering. Both of these functions apt to become increasingly important in the future. An extension of our infonnation gathering, including continuous surveillance of deep space, should have high priority. This could be done in two ways. One is to increase our ability to launch satellites of all needed varieties within a short time. The other is to provide decoys in space, thereby multiplying the number of targets the enemy would have to knock out. A combination of these two procedures could, indeed, avert the enemy from taking out all our space vehicles. A third possibility is to prepare retaliation against the enemy by destroying [heir space vehicles. But, at least in regard to the important item of information gathering, the enemy relies on stealth more than their spacecraft than we do; therefore emphasis on the first two [pAGE BREAKj,=== -4- 356"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"TIle SS Brotherhood of the Bell t\\vo (sic.) approaches is recommended. In preparing decoys for space vehicles, the main objective would be for decoys to look like space vehicles that function like real ones. One the whole, lhis is not too difficult. Usually the main problem with a decoy is its mass. In order for a decoy to be inexpensive it must be light, but usually the light weight gives it away - for instance, in meeting air resistance, a lighter vehicle is more easily slO\\ved down. Exceedingly little air resistance is encountered by space vehicles. Therefore. lightweight decoys for space vehicles are more feasible than decoys for almost any other application. Remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs) have been developed and tested with marginal success. The possibility of RPYs exist for the enemy as well for us. The use of RPVs was first explored by the U.S. Air Force. It can also be applied to small space objects. An ingenious new circular airfoil design is now in experimental stage. A single wing is used in this design. Another design is also under development. This one uses a single wing as well, pivoting at its center at the fuselage. The wing is al right angles to the plane at takeoff and landing, but as the right wing points forward wh.ile the left wing points backward. A third design is the triangle-shaped wing and is the focus of intense development of which I have personal kuowledge of. There is the possibility that chemical and biological warfare may be used by the enemy. The fact that these forms of warfare may be inflicted upon us from space only fires my [PAGE BREAK]=== -5- persistence in having the President consider my proposal seriously for a broad and comprehensive Space Defense Initiative. There are several fronts which must be considered in my proposal to the president. We must boost spending in new, more powerful radar. We must encourage more research programs for lasers. And, we must investigate the use of microwave and pulse energy devices along with directed energy weapons in space systems. Particle beams are effeclive over vaSl distances and could aid in space defense against intruding enemy spacecraft. Progress toward such an objective, since the end of World \\Var II, has occurred in discouragingly small steps. Even so, we cannot afford (Q give up hope; we cannot afford to stop taking small steps.

Presidential Approval [] Ves [] No ===[END DOCUMENT]===== ANALYSIS: 1. In Teller's private letter that the SDI program is called rather the Space Defense Initiative, rather than the Strategic Defense Initiative. 2. While it is clear from the opening paragraph that Teller's remarks throughout the letter could be construed as referring to (a) an extra-terrestrially based and originated threat, it is also true that his remarks could be construed (b) in the standard terrestrial sense as referring to the Soviet Union, or (c) in a lIoll-standard terrestrial sense as referring to some unknown terrestrially originated and based threat that nonetheless possesses an advanced outer space traveling capability. 3. With regard to point 2(c) above, observe that the genocidal and \"cosmic war\" implications Teller alludes to could clearly indicate the presence, within whatever unknown threat constitutes the concern of his letter, of an ideology that is fundamentally a \"globalcidal\" death cult. It goes without saying that this ideology is consonant to deeply held Nazi beliefs. This may indicate an extra-terrestrial spiritual influence on the development of the ideology of Nazism. 4. Finally it is to be noted that Teller outlines a program of development of an exotic array of directed energy weapons, presumably for offensive as well as defensive purposes against this unknown threat. PRELIMINARY SCENARIO ASSESSMENT From the foregoing documentary considerations, a broad scenario emerges. I. From j 933-1942, the US and the two Axis powers, Germany and Italy, recover and begin the process of back-engineering 358"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Th.55 Brotherhood of the Bell exotic technology discovered in crashed craft of unknown origin. Alternately, Nazi ideology formed the basis and environment for the development of a whole new physics and technology. 2. From the memos of President Roosevelt to General Marshall, it is clear that the US has concentrated its scientific efforts on the immediate defeat of Germany and Japan through the development and deployment of the atomic bomb via the Manhattan Project, and thus does not undertake immediate wartime development of the recovered technology. 3. From The Reich of the Black Sun is it clear that Nazi Germany, conversely, placed the highest priority on the development of the same sort of technology represented in the alleged crashes. It may be reasonably speculated that since the Kammlerstab had one such back-engineering component in its departmental organization that it may have been involved in the reverse engineering of such a craft. Alternatively, as was seen in Part Two, there was sufficient ideological and scientific ferment in Nazi Germany to pursue the development of the exotic physics represented by the Bell entirely independently of any need for an \"ET Crash\" to provide the motivation or impulse. 4. It is not germane to the case whether the pre-war and wartime recoveries were of extra-terrestrial origins or not. However, the quickness with which the USA was apparently able to redesign the recovered craft in its own \"S\" craft after the war indicates that the technology is not so exotic as to compel an ET interpretation of its origins. It is, however, as the MAJlc-12 Cooper-Cantwheel documents repeatedly note, exotic enough to require the assistance of the Nazi Paperclip personnel. In short, home-grown American talent is too unfamiliar with the type of physics and engineering that the recovered vehicles, whatever their origin may be, imply. 5. It also appears from the analysis of documents in the previous section that MJ-12 was involved, and may form the ultimate motivation behind, the murders of JFK and Secretary James Forrestal. The subsequent spin-off and privatization and internationalization of the group - as alleged by Cooper's Source I - would seem to indicate that some internal influence, 359"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"\"The Da)' After Corso: More MAJIC-J 2 Documents\" with such international and financial connections, within the MJ-12 group was successful in gaining control of the group and wresting it from the control of the US government. Only two such groups are alluded to in the documents examined thus far: (a) the Masons, in the form of \"the 33 investors\" of Document 5 (implying the participation and involvement of fraternal groups in the financing and research of these Black projects); and (b) the Paperclip scientists, implying a connection to, and the continued existence of, post-war international Nazi organizations such as O.D.E.S.S.A. and others. 6. In such documents as have been examined, no specific technological or performance characteristic of the recovered craft is of sufficient performance characteristics to indicate an interstellar origin much less and interplanetary one, since the stated speeds for the vehicles are far below what they would need to be to make such travel possible. Moreover, it is apparent that the performance characteristics in most respects is consonant more with very high altitude high performance craft flying within the terrestrial atmosphere. Other than the allusions to atomic and magnetic drives, which would be consonant with exo-atmospheric flight, the speeds are still far too slow for practical interplanetary travcl within our own solar system. 7. This in tum suggests that at the highest levels of MJ-12 a \"deep cover\" disinformation operation is being waged, to make people think in terms of (friendly) extra-terrestrial visitation as an explanation, while it is apparent from the examined documents that there is an even deeper level of concern that the craji are indeed hostile and have \"globalcidal\" ill/en/ions. Such an ideology is consonant with deeply held Nazi beliefs and is thus another subtle indicator of the nature of the US government's concern and the reason for the high security operation that is MJ-l2. 8. In respect to point 7, it is to be noted that Robert and Ryan Wood seem unable to concentrate on internal technical details of any MJ-12 document without obfuscating them in favor of the ET Hypothesis. 360"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell 9. A possible means of explaining MJ-12 motivations bebind the murder or sanction of the murder of JFK should be noted. If, as one of the documents suggested, JFK planned a joint expedition with the USSR to militarize the moon as a means of defense against the threat posed by UFOs, then this would seem, in light of the pattern emerging of US-USSR cooperation regarding Antarctica, that Kennedy posed a threat to MJ-12 and thereby to the secret Paperclip influence over MJ-12 and over the monopoly on the research and technology and weapons developed undcr its aegis. j 0 The year 1969 is the year MJ-12 is privatized and internationalized. Thus, this might represent, on one point of view, a step in the reassembly of the broken and scattered parts of Nazi secret weapons black projects. If so, then corroboration is rather easy to find: it should be a relatively easy thing to look for details of corporate actions, mergers, and maneuvers and technological developments from that time forward to see if a pattern - if any - emerges that would corroborate or deny this hypothesis. Alternatively, one might look for strange corporate actions immediately prior to and during the period of the JFK assassination that have a German connection or flavor.

There is considerable evidence to support this belief. And perhaps this is really the one and the only secret explanation of flying saucers. Perhaps Henry J. Taylor, Billy Ross, and some other commentators were right when they said. quite early in the game, that nying saucers are secret weapons. The only trouble was, they said they were U. S. weapons. Such may not have been the case at all. But certainly, the Taylor \"expose\" was the one thing that drew instant. emphatic and universal denial by every branch of the armed services, with even a spokesman for the President considering it important enough to issue a \\Vhite House denial. There has been no such overwhelming denial of the extraterrestrial theory - there has even been semi-encouragement of this theory all along by the Air Force - although on one occasion a press conference was held following Major Keyhoe's article in TRUE that claimed saucers were from outer space, and there was another denial when President Eisenhower said, in late 1954, that he had been told that saucers were not from outer space. But, when it was said that saucers were U. S. secret warcraft, there was instant, overwhelming denial. Yet there is evidence that saucers may be a new and different type of earth craft. This evidence is not secret. It has been published to millions of people in newspapers and magazines. This writer has had no access to classified information of any kind. There is absolutely nothing here that [PAGE BREAK]== 365"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":",-' rhe Day After Corso: More 1\\fAJIC-12 Documents\" The extremely high speed. The seemingly impossible maneuvering and the matter of G-pull - the pull of the earth's gravity - on any occupant or occupants. 3. The lack of sound in objects flying faster than sound. The motors of conventional planes roar, or their jets sound like giant blowtorches in the sky. And when a plan of conventional design passes through the sound barrier, it causes a noise like a clap of thunder. Many saucers observed were not [unreadable 1 a stationary position or a slow speed into speeds that would take them through the ~~=[PAGE BREAK]=== sound barrier. 4. Glow. Many reporters of saucers described them as glowing, either with a greenish-blue glare on the inside, or with completely glowing exterior - reddish, orange, yellow, or otber shades of the spectrum. Now, how about these points? Do they absolutely eliminate the possibility that saucers may be earth craft, after all? Most writers, citing these points, have dismissed the possibilities. But let's take the points, one by one, and analyze them. I . Speed. Conventional craft, using a principle of \"boring through\" air, or being forced through air, can get red hot, have metals creep, can fall apart or bum to a crisp from friction. However, by utilizing the principle of \"Coanda's Effect,\" with the object flying in a partial vacuum of its own making, this problem could be overcome. In the opinion of Professor Henri Coanda, discoverer of the effect, as given to Art Buchwald, it would be overcome. In many obsen'ations of extremely high speeds in saucers, the most extreme speeds were not observed in the dense, lower layers of our atmosphere, but at higher altirudes, far, far above the earth. And a great many observations of saucers have indicated that they rise in a series of hstairsteps,\" and achieve greatest velocity does not come from publications. The {Major thing?} here tbat the Intelligence Headquarters of Russia, England. Italy, Spain, Sweden, Yugoslavia and every other country of any consequence of the face of the globe does not know - or could easily acquire by the most amateurish of efforts. There are no secrets here in this phase of the questioning of the nature of saucers. If there were secrets, they have long since been revealed and given away. But no writer, to this author's knowledge, has ever brought together the bits of this part of the jig-saw puzzle. Yet they are very significant bits and merit the consideration of anyone trying to understand the mystery of the saucers. Let's try to put some of the bits together: Practically all writers on the subject of saucers have discounted the possibility that the saucers have their home basis right here on earth for three or four reasons - and, at first sight, these are very good reasons indeed. Among them are: I. 2. 366"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhootf of the Bell only after gaining the upper reaches of the atmosphere where density, air resistance and friction would be much less. And on this subject of speed it is well to remember that speeds seemingly impossible to eanh craft in 1947, when the first when the first saucers were widely reponed, seem terribly old-fashioned wday. In 1947. men were trying to break the speed of sound - and secretly had succeeded. But this speed of something over 700 mph became old hat in just six years, when Maj. Charles E. Ycager, in December, 1955. new [PAGE BREAK1~~ a plane of conventional [unreadable] at more than 1,600 mph, or something more than two and one-halftimes the speed of sound. And by May, 1955, scientists at Langley Field, Virginia, were reponing that they were doing research on guided missiles that might reach the speed of 15,000 mph. The scientists pointed out that then (1955) they were nying missiles at speeds of 3,000 mph from Wallops Island, Virginia. Speed. and speed alone - even the fantastic higher speeds reponed in saucers - would not seem to mle out completely the possibility that saucers are earth-made. 2. Maneuverabilitv and G-pull on occupant. A great deal of nonsense has been written about the impossibility of having anything human survive the mad maneuvers observed in saucers: acute-angled turns with no slackening in speed: high-speed circling of two discs in the air, as if they were \"charging their batlcrics;\" tremendous acceleration from practically zero to thousands of miles an hour; abrupt reverses in direction. But do all tilose tilings rule out the possihility that saucers might be man-made? Not at aiL First, they might be unmanned missiles - especially thc tiny saucers that have been reported. Next, now things are coming to light about G- pull and the amount a human can survive, about ··weightlessness\". about other factors that may enter into the picture. For instancc, in the magazine .E.!.YiJJg, March, 195 I, p, 34. First Lieutenant Hugh F. McLaurin, USAF. answered the following questions: \"What would happen [unreadable] plane and suddenly catapulted into the sky at 13,000 mph? 'Would you sweat ===~[PAGE BREAK11==== blood? Would you be killed by acceleration or by pressure change? The answers arc all no, Lt. McLaurin knew. He went through such a speed in a simulated test and survived. Again, on G-pull. Major Donald E. Keyhoe, writing in TRUE, Decemher, 1952, wrote: \"By applying tilrust in an opposite direction, abruptly reversing thrust, an object can be halted in seconds. Tests made with a G-sled by 367"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"\"Tile Day After Corso: More MAJIC-ll Documents\" the Air Force has shown that, for a fraction of a second, human beings can take a force of 45 G's and survive.\" Maybe Major Keyhoe was a little premalure in his announcement of Ihis fact, but as proof of iI, USAF, on December 27, 1954, announced Ibat one of ils officers, Lt. Col. John P. Slapp, bad gone from a record land speed of 652 mph 10 a dead SLOp in I _ seconds wilhoul ill effects. This quick stop was made at Holloman Air Development Center at Alamogordo, New Mexico. In the lest, Col. Slapp was strapped 10 a 2,000- pound rocket sled. The only ill effects he suffered were a few blood blislers from dust particles in Ihe air and Iwo black eyes, caused by his eyeballs being Ihrown forward against his eyelids during Ihe deceleration period. In stopping, Col. Stapp withstood a pressure equal 10 35 G's. His \"weight\" was more than three tons. On Ihe evening of December 28, 1954, Ihere appeared in The New York World Telegram and Sun a writeup of an inlerview wilh Col. Stapp, made on Ihe 27\", in which the colonel said Ihal he expecled to travel al 1,200 mph on Ihe sled. This would be nearly twice as fast, wilh proportionale slep-up in G- pressure. with a violent stop. Can man withstand the violent maneuvers and sudden decelerations observed in flying saucers? What do you Ihink? TOP SECRETIMAJlC ====I[PAGE BREAK] TOP SECRET/MAJIC Another factor sometimes overlooked by writers on flying saucers is the phenomenon of weightlessness. If you don't weigh anything, ie., if you have a condition of zero gravity, you can't very well be slammed around by violent maneuvers in the air. Some writers have, however, pointed out that extraterrestrial craft, using some fonn of magnetic propulsion, might create their own gravitational fields and thus be free of gravitational pull from the earth. Maybe it is nol as complicaled as all Ihat. In TRUE for July, 1954, wriler Don Dwiggins described weightlessness as experienced in a two-seater plane flown by Maj. Edward J. Rackham, USAF acceplance pilol al Lockheed's Van Nuys, California, plant. They wenl up 10 only 20,000 feel and then wenl into a ballistic curve. The result was weighllessness. Mr. Dwiggins pholographed a pack of cigarettes floaling free in the cabin of the plane. If weightlessness can be achieved with a ballistic curve, perhaps it can be achieved in some olher, but fairly easy way. And such weightlessness mighl pennit violent maneuvering, such as has been (reported?) in flying saucers. But, if you will read further on the subject of weightlessness, you will find that tbis phenomenon presents grave hazards to the ainnan. LIFE Magazine, in an article in its December 6, 1954, issue, pointed out that weightlessness is a highly unpleasant sensation. Mr. airman has been able to stand it for more than 368"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell 45 seconds. It produces severe disorientation. It dislocates all sense of direction. It produces nausea, nervous distress, Joss of ability to co-ordinate, inability to guide the complex machinery oftoday's flying craft. So one argument negates the other here. TOP SECRET/MAJIC ===[PAGE BREAK]==== TOP SECRETIMAJIC 3. The [unreadable] faster than sound. Here, again, let us refer to the new principle of flight, the \"Coanda Effect.\" If a craft is flying in a parrial vacuum, not pushing and compressing the air in front of it, or \"boring through\" it, (it is) conceivable it might be possible to glide through the atmosphere and [unreadable] through the sound barrier without thc \"clap of thunder\" made by conventional planes. As for the lack of sound issuing from the vehicle itself - motor, engine, turbine, jet - if there exists some new and little publicized principle of flight, plus some new and unpublished method of propulsion - magnetic. anti-gravitational, atomic - it might be possible to achieve soundlessness or near soundlessness. 4. Glow. This is one to really stump the experts, in trying to explain saucers as completely terrestrial craft. But certain atomic, radioactive materials glow with the same kind of blue-green glaze noted in some saucer interiors. But how a crew could be protected from gamma rays emanating from such materials poses an unanswerable question. As to glowing exteriors - Major Kcyhoe had written at some length, theorizing that the glow of extraterrestrial space craft could come from varying degrees of heat caused by friction - from preactically white-hot to red-hot, to orange-hot, to yellow-hot, going from highest speeds to the lowest. Perhaps this same principle would hold true of earth-made craft, as well as extrate-rrestrial vehicles. As to the question of materials which could withstand these heats - present rocket speeds, as published in newspapers - are above 4,000 mph. Such speeds must cause temperatures that make rockets glow - like saucers. All this may be very thin evidence that saucers could be earth craft. But [unreadable] a lot of evidence TOP SECRETIMAJIC ====I[PAGE BREAK]==== TOP SECRET/MAJIC used to support [unreadable 1 thought. And there is a great deal of other evidence that is factual, not based upon pure supposition and theory. For instance, Professor Coanda discovered his new principle of flight back in 1937. This principle, described previollsly, in essence is that if you curve a jet of air, or many jets of air, you also create an artificial cyclone, with the 369"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"\"The Day After Corso: More MAJ1C-12 DoclImenls\" tremendous lift of a cyclone, and can lift and maneuver a many-tanned object because you create a vacuum above the whirling blasts of the jets. Here is a flOle that may fit: /n The Washington DoUr News for May 14, /949, was a copyrighted story that the flying discs were of Spanish-Nazi origin. The allthor held the view ,1101 tile discs were very real. and that they were of a new \"gyroscopic\" design. Here is another nole that also fits somewhere into the picture: On }vfay 22, 1952, there died ill Rome. Ita/y, Giuseppe Belluzo, seventy-six, ltalian scielllisis ondformer cabinet member. To quote/rom an article about him in The New York Herald Tribune: \"A1r.

'There is nothing supernatural or Martian aboUl flying discs. ' Mr. [unreadable] simply IIatiollo/ TOP SECRETIMAJIC ===~[ENDl === ANALYSIS: And here, just when it was getting good, the excerpt on the Woods' website ends. Nonetheless, enough detail is in it that readers of Reich of the Black Sun and of this book will have noted some stunning things. I. First, it is evident that Bowen's personal contacts brought him into contact with the head of General Patton's intelligence as the following two statements attest: a. \"Charles R. Cadman, Col. Ret., (deceased), who was Ihe aide of Ihe late General George S. Patton, Jr., u.s. Army, and who was present at the special peiformance given for General Palton and his spear-head armored division at Roslau;\" b. \"Mr. Charles H. Reed, Col., ret., Richmond Virginian, who really spearheaded the saving of the Spanish Ric/ing School and ils horses while on his mission of persuading the head of German Intelligence to tllm over to the U.S. the many truckloads of documents 370"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"Tile SS Brotllerllood of tile Bell buried 011 tile Czech-Austriall border - doculllellts which are still secret today.\" Thus, General Patton's Third Army operations in the late war were connected not only with gathering in the treasure trove of the Kammlerstab 's top secret research, but also German military intelligence's archives that had been secreted along the Czech-German border. These \"archives\" could in turn refer to one of three things: a. The archives of German Intelligence, particularly of General Reinhard Gehlen's Fremde Heere Ost; b. The actual German War Archives, which as recounted in Reich 0/ the Black Sun had been transferred to Thuringia, which is along the German-Czech border; c. The secreted cache of reports, patents, and so on that the Kammlerstab moved to this area probably under the direct auspices and oversight of Kammler himself. The information at the end of Bowen's \"Encyclopedia\" tends to corroborate that this third alternative was the actual case, and tends also to support the thesis, argued in Reich 0/ the Black Sun, that General Patton was somehow involved in a highly classified operation designed to secure Kamm IeI' and the Kammlerstab archives. 3. The bulk of the Bowen UFO Encyclopedia that is extant at the Woods' website is from Chapter xrv of Bowen's book, and it appears that Bowen most favors the terrestrial hypothesis as the explanation for the origin of the saucer phenomenon, and moreover that he believes them 10 be the product of secret black projects weapons development. 4. He then cites the newspaper article that clearly reveals what he thinks the origin of saucers to be. The secret projects of Nazi Germany (and Fascist Italy!). a. It is to be pointed out that Bowen's conclusions, coming as they do through personal acquaintance with Patton's intelligence aide, most likely set off alarm Bells - pun intended - within MJ-12, and that they also appear be/ore the first publication of Renato Vesco's In/ercept But Don't Shoot which Iikewise attributes the 371"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"\"Tile Day After Corso: More MAJIC-12 Documents\" origin of the post-war UFO phenomenon to the wartime development of Nazi flying saucers and to Belluzo. Bowen has thus arrived at his conclusions independently and a full decade before Vesco's book was first published. b. Bowen additionally provides the background that Belluzzo/Bellonzo was a highly placed official in Mussolini's government, and in addition to his expertise in steam turbines alleged in other sources, is also an expert in projectile ballistics. This would make Belluzzo/Bellonzo a leading candidate for membership in Mussolini's Top Secret UFO study group RS33 led by Marconi. c. The strong implication of Bowen's remarks is that someone somewhere is continuing the secret development of this technology, and the context of the excerpt of his Encyclopedia also points to the people doing it: Nazis. 5. The last point raises the problem of the reasons for MJ-12's classification of his work. After all, as his preface makes clear that the work is drawn entirely from public accounts and sources. One may therefore conclude that the reasons for the classification lie precisely in the conclusions he draws from these of a terrestrial origin and a connection to Nazism and secret black project development of these technologies, a conclusion at odds with the \"ET cover story\" being adopted at the highest and deepest levels of the US military. Bowen himself makes this clear over and over in the chapter cited. But beyond this, what deeper motivation might lie behind the classification? [ can see only three: a. The classification was extended because MJ-12 itself knew of the ultimate origins of at least the Roswell saucer, and suspected an independent entity was continuing the Nazi research, a hypothesis advanced in Reich of the Black Sun; b. The classification was extended because MJ-12, by this date, was already heavily infiltrated by the very Nazis 372"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"The SS BrOlherhoOlI of Ihe Bell and Paperclip personnel who were beginning to exercise great influence over the direction of the project and beginning to wrest it from control of the US government. c. The membership of MJ-12 was divided into two camps at its top decision making level between groups with (I) no Nazi connections or sympathies, and who are ignorant of the extent of Nazi influence and R&D being conducted independently. This group suspects an independent entity is continuing the Nazi weapons development, and that this independent group is Nazi, and classifies the Encyclopedia for that reason; (2) a second group with Nazi ties and sympathies and perhaps ongoing contact with whatever entity continued, under a new name, which for convenience I have called the \"SS Brotherhood of the Bell\". This group, for entirely different reasons, would want to deflect attention away not only from Nazi survival, but from azi continuance of advance technologies and weapons projects, and from the fact that this continuance was independent of any sovereign stale. Classification by either group would also be unavoidable since the document also hints that Patton's strange end-war operations can only be satisfactorily explained in connection to GenTIan military intelligence and/or to the Kammlerstab, its archives and personnel, to American Black projects and nominal American \"jurisdiction \". 6. The essence of these conclusions tends to corroborate as well the basic thesis behind William Harbison's novel Genesis that such independent development was indeed the ultimate controlling power behind the more well-known UFO crash-retrieval cases and that this power was specifically tied to Nazism. 373"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":".. The Day After Corso: More MAJIC-12 Doc/lments\" B. The Day After Corso: An Examination o/Corso 's The Day After Roswell!n the Light 0/ the Cooper-Cantwhee! Documents And German Wartime Technology Corso's thesis bears repeating once again: My boss, General Trudeau, asked me to use the army's ongoing weapons development and research program as a way to filler the Roswell technology into the mainstream of industrial development through the military defense contracting program. Today, items such as lasers, integrated circuitry, fiber-optics networks, accelerated particle- beam devices, and even the Kevlar material in bulletproof vests are all commonplace. Yet the seeds for all of them were found in the crash of the alien craft at Roswell and turned up in my files fourteen years later. 26 The elements of this thesis may be broken down into the following list: I. Something crashed in New Mexico; 2. It was recovered by the US Army Air Force; 3. It contained exotic technology of such a nature as to compel the interpretation that what crashed was extra- terrestrial in origin; 4. The recovery of this technology from the crash was back- engineered and led to the ET-derived technologies of a. the integrated circuit (and by implication, its forerunner, the transistor); b. the laser; c. fiber-optics; d. particle beams and particle accelerators. Points I and 2 are disputed by no one, so we pass immediately to point 3.

But there is more. As early as 1947, scientists who had gone to the Air Material ComOlnd at \\Vrighl Field to see the debris were speculating that the electronic potemial of the Roswell craft reminded them of the German and British anligravity experiments of the 1920s and I 930s. General Twining was reported to have said more than once that the name of the Serbian electrical engineer and inventor of alternating currem, Nikola Tesla. kept bubbling tip ill the conversation because the scientists e.xamining the damaged craft described the way it must have converted an electromagnetic field into all antigravity field. And, of course, the craft itself reminded them of the German experimental fighter aircraft that made their appearance near the end of the war but that had been in development ever since the 1930s. 29 Well might the name of Tesla have come up repeatedly, since Tesla toward the end of his life made a rather astonishing series of statements concerning his \"dynamic theory of gravity\": During the succeeding two years (1893 and 1894) of intense concentration I was fortunate enough to make two far reaching discoveries. The first 'was a dynamic rheory of gravity, which I have worked out in all details and hope to give to the world very soon. 11 explains rhe causes of this force and the morions of heavenly bodies under its influence so satisfactorily that it will put an end to (he idle speculation and false conceptions, as that of curved space ....

In any case, it is significant that his name kept surfacing in the scientific discussions concerning the Roswell debris at Wright Field, according to Corso, and that it did so also in the context of \"British and German\" 1930s antigravity experiments. Once again, something about the technology looked velY familiar: At the very least, Twining had suggested, the crescent-shaped craft tooked so uncomfortably like the Gem,an Horten wings our flyers had seen at the end of the war that he had to suspect the Germans had bumped into something we dido'l know about. And his conversations with Wernher von Braun and Willy Ley at Alamogordo in the days after the crash confirmed this. They didn't want to be thought of as verriikt (crazy) but intimated that there was a deeper story about what the Gennans had engineered.)l The answer of course is that which Corso implies: there was a \"German Roswell\" before the war. J2 The development by the Germans of Tesla's ideas or of a vortex aether atom model are never even mentioned as a possibility by Corso. So what of Corso's allegations about fiber optics, lasers, and integrated circuits, three of the \"ET technologies\" that jump-started America's post-war technological surge according to the his thesis? i.

Corso has this to say about it: The entire development arc of the radio tube, from Edison's first experiments with filament for his incandescent lightbulb to the vacuum tubes that formed the switching mechanisms of ENIAC, lasted about fifty years. The developmem of the silicon transistor seemed to come upon us in a matter ofmomhs. And, had Inot seen the silicon wafers from the Roswell crash with my own eyes. held them in my own hands talked aboUl them with Hermann Oberth, Wernher von Braun, or Hans Kohler, and heard (he reports from these now dead scientists of the meetings between Nathan Twining, Vannevar Bush, and researchers at Bell Labs, I would have thought the invention of the transistor was a miracle. I now know how it came about. J4 According to Corso's thesis, the answer is, of course that it was all due to exotic recovered ET technology recovered at Roswell. Note especially the \"miraculous silicon wafers,\" the marvelous semi- conducting miracle that would make the integrated circuit possible. But now Corso's thesis begins to collapse, at least in this matter, for if it was true that miniaturization of electronic components was an essential feature for America's space program, then it was much more so a necessity for the Nazis and their rockets, if they werc ever to be turned into viable weapons for hurling heavy atomic bombs at anyone. As for the transistor, whose \"discovery history pedigree\" is admitted to be obscure at best by many researchers, it did indeed appear to burst on the world in the late 1940s from nowhere .... .. .. unless one recalls a very similar looking device, already in use by tbe Germans, in 1940: J] Corso, The Day After Roswel., p. 169. \"Ibid., p. 168, emphasis added. 378"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell Telefunken One can only wonder then, how far this work was pressed from this little tube's appearance and use in Nazi Germany in 1940 to the \"discovery\" of the transistor in 1947.

Thus, as far as the transistor goes, the historical and verifiable record points, not to \"E.T.\" as the origin of the Roswell debris and recovered technology, but to Nazi Germany. 2. Lasers But what of lasers themselves, which Corso also maintains was one of the many devices stemming from the recovered \"ET\" technology from the Roswell crash? As my previous book Reich o[ the Black Sun and as chapter 5 of this book showed,35 lasers too were one aspect of \"quantum coherence\" being researched by the Germans. Igor Witkowski is even more specific in his account of just what the Germans were after, for they were not, it seems, after an ordinary optical laser: After all it is common knowledge that among other things work was also carried out on some kind of \"X-ray laser\" - a source of coherent X-ray or gamma radiation, which is well-known to be lethal to living organisms at high intensity. Thanks to searches carried out in German archives it has been possible to establish that in 1944 a special Luftwaffe research establishment received the task to develop such a weapon, situated at the lOwn of Gross Ostheim. Materials relating to this work are currently located in a civilian establishment ~ the Karlsruhe research centre and were disclosed several years ago .... One can make out that three different lethal radiation emitters were worked on and that the construction of such a device, effective as an anti- aircraft weapon lay within the Third Reich's range of possibilities and its military use was possible in a relatively short time - that is to say still before the end of the war. The third and most mature version of the weapon assumed the irradiation of a target 5 kilometers away at a rate of 7 rads a second for 30 seconds which, as affirmed in the report, was completely sufficient to totally paralyze the aircraft's crew. 36 \"Reich of the Black SUIl. pp. 104-105, and chapter 5 here. specifically the remarks of Horst Korsching, pp. 186-187. 3.

Again, this means that the concept of coherence predated Roswell as did the first experimental steps towards its realization. There is nothing necessarily extra-terrestrial whatsoever about it. 3. Fiber Optics Then what of fiber optics? Surely this, at least, was so exotic that no terrestrially-based proto-typical technology existed in 1947? \"Members of the retrieval team who foraged around inside the spacecraft on the morning of the discovery,\" Corso states, Told Colonel Blancard back at the 509,h (Bomb group) that they were amazed they couldn't tind any conventional \\\\'iring. \\lJhere were the electrical connections? They didn't understand the function of the printed circuit wafers they found, but, even more important, they were completely mystified by the single glass filaments that ran through the panels of the ship.\" So once again off Colonel Corso went to consult with a German Paperclip scientist, Hans Kohler: 38 The technology was still very new, Hans Kohler told me during a private briefing in early 1962, but the promise of using light as a carrier of all kinds of signals through single-filament glass strands was holding great promise. He explained that the premise of optical fibers was to have a filament of glass so fine and free of any impurities that nothing would impede the light beam moving along the center of the shaft.\" But unfortunately, at this point here there exists an indicator - a very slight one - that some work along these lines was also underway in Nazi Germany. \" Corso, The Day AJle,. Roswell, p. 209. 38 And inevitably, the question occurs, is this the same Hans Kohler, or Coler, that invented the Coler coil? \"Corso, op. cit., p. 210. 381"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"\" The Day After Corso: lIfore IIfAJIC-I 2 Documellts\" There exists a list of special German research projects in radar, homing devices, and so on that describes a project headed a Professor Karolus, based in Leipzig, whose purpose was to investigate the modulation of mercury lighting for the purposes of \"light telephony\" that would have operated in the infrared band. Nothing more is known about it, but the connection of the project to telephony does raise questions, one that Igor Witkowski himself asks very bluntly: \"Could this have referred to some kind of precursor to present day optical fibre telephony?,,40 What are we to conclude from all this? As regards the MAJlc-12 documents examined here, one has indications of a definite pattern of exotic though entirely terrestrial technology, and one that might be under independent or quasi- independent development. And during the period from the end of the war to the early 1960s, only one entity really would have an interest in doing so, a \"Nazi International.\" As regards the Corso thesis of Roswell, it is clear that, in two out of the three cases mentioned here - the transistor and the laser- that he adduces were the results of ET seeded technology, there are wartime German antecedents in the technology tree. In the last case - fiber optics - there is a vague reference to \"light telephony\" that might represent a prototypical technology leading eventually to the modem fiber optic technology. However, when Corso's thesis is viewed in conjunction with the MAJlc-12 documents reviewed here, and in conjunction with what is known of wartime German research achievements, his thesis shows itself to be rather weak. Indeed, more documentmy substantiation exists for a terrestrial and German origin for some of the technology he cites ill support of his thesis, than there e.xists evidence for its extra-terrestrial origin, for which Corso adduces not a shred of evidence other than his stories. Indeed, in these anecdotal stories Corso every now and then includes statements to the effect that our military saw the \"German resemblance\" in the \"ET\" technology recovered at Roswell! Unless one is to believe the Nazis' own Thule Society-inspired belief that the white Aryan race is ultimately of extra-terrestrial origin, the indicators seem '0 Igor Witkowski, The Tnllh Abollt the WUlldeMajJe. pp. 157, 158. 382"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell preponderantly to point to terrestrial, and most probably German origins for the technology. Finally, the MAJIC-12 documents examined in this chapter either allude indirectly to, or openly assert, the involvement of the shadowy UFO group in the assassination of President Kennedy. But before leaving the subjects of MAJlC-12, Nazi Paperclip personnel, Roswell, and Colonel Corso, a final word shows how weirdly, and how intimately, they are all connected: Col. Philip Corso, info source for last year's book The Day Afier Roswell. and temporary darling of Ufology, has brought attention to himself with the revelation of a history in spin control and association with right wing extremist elements in the mHitary as well as his fanner ties to a semi-secret society called the \"Shickshinny Knights of Malta\" Before The Day After Roswell was a gleam in the eye of someone at Simon and Schuster. Peter Dale Scon wrote about Corso in Deep Politics alld the Death of JFK. In the light of the fact that he is working on another book with Roswell co-author William Bimes (to be entitled The Day After Dallas) it is worth noting that Corso was (111 illl J estigator involved with the Warren Commission who according to Scolt, '>built on ... anti CIA paranoia by telling his friend and fellow Senate staffer [for segregationist Strom Thurmond] Julien Sourwine, who made sure it was relayed to the FBI, that Oswald was tied to a communist ring inside the CIA, and was doubling as an informant for the FBI.\" ....

(circa 1963-64) the organization seemed (Q operate as an underground think tank and spin factory ... Corso disavows any association with the group. Perhaps this has little to do with Corso's present activities, however a few people in the UFO community have expressed the feeling that his claims in Roswell may be the resull of a few verifyable (sic) facls diluted with much more mis- or disinfomlation. If this is true. Corso himself may not be aware of it. In light of the man's history, this may not be far off the mark, and there is reason to suspect that he may have been called out of retirement to play the role of publicist onc last time. 41 41 Gregory Bishop, ed., Wake Up DOIVII There!

A. J.F.K's Policies Regardless of whether one agreed or disagreed with his politics, President John F. Kennedy managed during his short term in office to outline policies that clearly threatened a number of well-entrenched and very powerful interests, interests that many believe to comprise elements of America's \"Establishment\" or \"secret government\". Kennedy had, for example, circulated a national security memorandum after the Bay of Pigs fiasco that effectively turned all paramilitary and covert operations over to the Pentagon, wresting it from the CIA. He had vowed to \"smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.\" For those people like Allen Dulles or General Charles Peare Cabell - whose appearance in the MAJlc-12 documents we noted in the previous chapter - Kennedy was taking a direct aim at the fiefdoms of bureaucratic power that they had 3 John G.

And with the memorandum, he had scored a direct hit. And, after one of the America's most closely contested elections, Kennedy had won by a narrow margin over Republican incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon. Many maintain that Kennedy won because key counties across the country, like Chicago's notoriously corrupt Cook county in Illinois, were \"delivered\" to the Kennedy column by then Mayor Richard Daly and various Mafia contacts. It was a story that was claimed for other hotly contested counties. After assuming office, President Kennedy appointed his brother Robert to be Attorney General, and the Kennedy Administration began to go after organized crime. And with brother Robert heading the Justice Department, yet another powerful enemy was gained besides the intelligence community and organized crime. That enemy was J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, a man who in the quiet circles of party-going power in Washington, D.C., made no secret of his hatred of the Kennedy administration. At this point, it is worth pausing to note that of these three potential enemies, two of them would exercise extraordinary influence over the post-assassination Warren Commission, for Allen Dulles, former head of the CIA and dismissed by Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs, would of course become a prominent member of the Commission, doubtless thereby insuring that any CIA connections were buried or at the very minimum, obfuscated in a word-spin of confusion. The other enemy that figured prominently in the outcome of the Commission was, of course, J. Edgar Hoover's FBI, which exercised inordinate influence over the flow of information and data to the Commission. As was seen in the previous chapter, however, there are MAJlC- 12 documents which - if one accepts their genuineness for the sake of argument - also indicate that Kennedy wanted to internationalize space jointly with the Soviet Union. If one assumes the existence of some covert aspect to either or both of the two countries' space programs, then this too, would have threatened a good many hidden agendas and entrenched power interests.

For the Torbitt document, Von Braun's control of the Defense Industrial Security Command (D.I.S.C.) becomes a symbol of this network of Paperclip scientists, connected in tum to other World War Two Fascists such as Ference Nagy, representing the emigre community that had collaborated with the Nazis, and that subsequently fled Eastern Europe and Communist reprisal after the war, and, via the Gehlen Organization, that set up a network of front organizations in Western Europe and the United States. These two groups - the Paperclip scientists and the Fascist emigre fronts - in turn were connected to a veritable \"Murder Incorporated,\" the so-called \"Perrnindex\" corporation, a company with many of these prominent Fascists, as well as Clay Shaw, on its board of directors. The Torbitt document - long before the Cooper-Cantwheel MAJlc-12 documents were ever released to, or planted in, the UFOlogy community - makes very clear a connection to the Kennedy assassination quickly brushed aside by most assassination researchers: The Nazis. But there is a final potential KetlL1edy enemy to consider. In June of 1963, the same year as his assassination, Kennedy took aim at one of the most powerful of the \"entrenched interests\" of the Establishment: international mercantile banking. President Kennedy authorized the printing of approximately four billion dollars of United States Notes and their release for circulation, thereby entirely bypassing the privately-owned Federal Reserve Bank, established by subterfuge and calculated political manipulation after the notorious secret Jekyll Island meeting. Kennedy's move clearly portended an end to the bankers' monopolistic hold over the nation's money supply and a return to \"constitutional money,\" money entirely free of interest to private banks. This aspect of the assassination conspiracy is even less well-known than the Nazi connection, and remains so. Careful consideration of the disparate groups connected with the assassination - the military-industrial complex, the \"national security 'community'\" represented by the CTA, FBI and other agencies, the space program, the Mafia, the military, right-wing emigre groups represented by various anti-Castro Cuban fronts as 388"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell well as the Eastern Europeans, and international corporate finance and banking - will indicate many connections between all these elements, as many assassination researchers have pointed out. But there is one group with connections to all of these organized interests, and that, of course, is the Nazis. B. Mae Brussell on Nazis and JFK 1. Her Thesis The late Mae Brussell, well-known conspiriologist and radio talk-show host, was never one to leave a stone unturned. Once having learned of the Torbill document and its contents, Brussell did what she normally did when confronted by the allegation of deep conspiracy: she began putting the pieces together and carefully documenting her sources. Her statement of Nazi involvement in the assassination at some high level takes account of these \"other players\" in the overall scheme: This is a story of how key Nazis, even as the Wehrmacht was still on the offensive, anticipated military disaster and laid plans to transplant Nazism, inract but disguised, in havens in the West. It is the story of how honorable men, and some not so honorable, were so blinded by the Red menace that they fell into lockstep with Nazi designs. It is the story of the Odd Couple Plus One: the mob, the CIA, and fanatical exiles, each \\\\fith its own reason for gunning for Kennedy. It is a story that climaxes in Dallas on November 22, 1963, when John Kennedy was struck down. And it is a story with an aftermath - America's slide to the brink offascism. 5 Kennedy was gunned down, in other words, by the well-known \"coalescence of interests,\" which, on Brussell's view, included the Nazis as very secretive players. But Brussell's statement hints at something more: a coup d'etat with an increasingly fascist face. This \"fascist face\" will become more and more visible as one considers the details of Brussell's research, which in tum, exposes , Mae Brussell. \"The Nazi Connection to the John F.

Germans and Atsugi AFB, Japan: An Oswald Nazi Link Lee Harvey Oswald. Say the name and most people think immediately of the assassin, or at least, of the fallguy, in the Kennedy murder. Fewer people will think of an apparently ordinary American man, with an ordinary background, who became a Marine, and then began to exhibit bizarre if not extraordinary political beliefs for a soldier, much less a Marine. Even fewer people still will think of those bizarre behaviors and political beliefs in connection with Oswald's known connections to the FBI, and conclude (in my opinion correctly) that Oswald's bizarre display of pro-Marxist political beliefs while a Marine at the secret Atsugi Air Force Base in Japan were part of a pattern of sheep-dipping him. Oswald, in spite of these openly professed beliefs, had certain security clearances at the secret radar base at the airfield, and was learning Russian as well. And there is one more thing, also well-known to most assassination researchers: Atsugi Air Base was where the CIA's U- 2 flights over the Soviet Union originated. As is well-known to many people, Oswald subsequently concocted a \"family emergency\" to tend to his sick mother, Marguerite Oswald, in order to be discharged from the Marines. After leaving the Marines, however, Oswald then traveled to the Soviet Union, where he then defected. He was placed in Minsk, Byelonlssia (White Russia), in a television factory, and was given, by Soviet standards, a spacious apartment. He met and eventually married Marina Oswald, the daughter of a Soviet military intelligence colonel. Many assassination researchers believe that Oswald fed the Soviets radar and other technical data which led to tbe shooting down of Francis Gary Powers' U-2 later the same year. Of course, the U-2 was flown out of Atsugi AFB ill Japan. Since the U-2 flights were CIA operations and not Air Force operations, this 390"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell means that the CIA had a secret base at the Atsugi compound. More about this in a moment. Then, unbelievably, Oswald was allowed to re-defect to the USA, along with his Russian wife - no mean feat in those days - where his subsequent movements and connections are more or less well-known. But what many people do not know is that Oswald, in addition to his connections to extremist left-wing beliefs and organizations, also had some very peculiar connections to extremist right wing people and organizations. One of them, unbelievably, is to the emigre-and-spy networks of none other than former Wehrmacht general Reinhard Gehlen. When (Allen) Dulles spoke, Gehlen listened. The CIA chief ws convinced, along with his brother, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, that the \"captive nations\" of the Soviet bloc would rise up if given sufficient encouragement. At his behest, Gehlen recruited and trained an exile mercenary force ready to rush in without involving American units. Also al Dulles' direction, Gehlen tapped the ranks of his wartime Russian collaborators for a cadre of spies to be parachuted into the Soviet Union. Some of these spies were schooled at the CIA's clandestine base at Atsugi, Japan, where, in J957, a young Marine named Lee Harvey Oswald was posted to the U-2 spy plane operation there. 6 While not establishing a direct connection to the Nazis, this is but one bit of information in a pattern of associations surrounding the assassination that Brussell uncovers. 3. Gehlen and the Russian Orthodox Diaspora Yet another piece in tbe assassination puzzle was the connection of Gehlen's \"Organization\" with the emigre communities of Eastern Europeans in this country: Gehlen pioneered the setting up of dummy fronts and cover companies to suppon his farflung coven operations. A major project was to form Eastern European emigre groups in the U.S. that could be used against 6 Mae Brussell, \"The Nazi Connection to the John F. Kennedy Assassination,\" p. 2. 391"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"\"Mae Brllssellsprouts: Nazi Survival and JFK\" the Soviets. Both the Tolstoy Foundation and the Union of Bishops of the Orthodox Church Outside Russia were funded hy the CIA. Lee and Marina Oswald arrived from the Soviet Union in June, 1962. They were hefriended by some three dozen White Russians in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area. Many had identifiable Nazi links; others were in the oil and defense industries. It was an improbable social set for a defector to the U.S.S.R. and his wife from Minsk.' In any case, it is clear that, via Oswald and similar people, Dulles' CIA was playing a very dangerous game with two very dangerous elements - the Soviets and Gehlen's own organization of \"former\" Nazis - that were implacable enemies of each other and, in tum, at root enemies of America as well. The intention of using the BND is clear: if the operation of training emigres at Atsugi and elsewhere was exposed, American involvement could be \"plausibly denied.\" Gehlen's Organization is thus the cut-out for the operation.

Nazis and \"/he Rogue Element\" In US Intelligence Various conspiracy researchers 8 have pointed out that there seems to be some \"rogue\" element within the American (and to a Jesser extent, other nations') intelligence services, acting on its own and often counter to its host nation's national interest, and following its own more-often-than-not murky agenda. Others have pointed out that the recent spate of terrorism has to have, at some point, major financial backing and the backing of some major world power. Still others have even hinted of the historical connection of Nazism to militant Islam and to the roots of other terrorist groupS.9 [n any case, a surviving and organized network of international Fascism would certainly fit the requirements for all these, though, of course, beyond the historically known connections, the case is speculative.

Consider only the fact that Hitler's financial wizard, Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, fonner President of the Reichsbank, and father- in-law to S5 Commando Otto Skorzeny, was subsequently \"on the payroll of Aristotle Onassis.\"IO We all know who subsequently married Aristotle Onassis, and who strictly refused to talk about what she knew about the murder of her husband. We all know she died relatively recently, still as poised and beautiful as ever, and gave strict instructions that her private diaries were not to be released until long in the future: Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. What we never knew, is that by marrying Onassis, Jackie had married into a family of organized crime with its own set of very strange, very Nazi, connections dating from World War Two. And what of Olto Skorzeny? Skorzeny survived the war, helped direct the notorious 0.D.E.5.S.A. organization (Organization der Ehemalige S5 Angehorige, or \"Organization of Former SS Members), and established the \"Internationale Fascista\" in Madrid, Spain, in the same building as was occupied by Spanish Intelligence, and by the Madrid section of the CfA I 5. Dulles and McCloy on the Warren Commission Weirder still were some of the people chosen to be on the Warren Commission, two of whom can only be viewed with extreme suspicion.

Dulles as a member of the Warren Commission is perhaps the best example of the post-assassination spin network's ability to undo the \"damage\" caused by the Kennedy Administration, for Dulles was of course fired by Kennedy for his role in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. We do know what another prominent member of the Warren Commission was up to before the war: John J. McCloy. For those who may have forgotten, John J. McCloy was the post-war American High Commissioner for (West) Germany, and was responsible for pardoning many Nazis from their war crimes sentences in order to expedite their extradition to the U.S.A. and their use in Operation Paperclip and similar projects. But before tbe war John J. McCloy was so higbly placed, so \"in\" on the \"inside track,\" tbat he managed to sbare a box witb Adolf Hitler at tbe 1936 Berlin Olympics in what may have been his first television appearance. But why such high honors for an American lawyer? This is in part because he was an attorney for the German chemical cartell.G. Farben before the war. 6. A Review Just in case it was missed, a review is in order: One Warren Commission member was post-war U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, pardoned numerous Nazis, had personally met Adolf Hitler, and legally represented German chemical-industrial giant LG. Farben before the war: John J. McCloy. One Warren Commission member had been fired by President Kennedy for his role in the Bay of Pigs, had been Director of the CIA, was OSS station chief in Zuricb during the war, and had negotiated the secret deal between German military intelligence guru General Reinhard Geblen, as was as possible otber secret deals between \"surrendering\" Nazis and the U.S.A.: Allen Dulles. 395"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"\"Mae Brussellsprouts: Nazi Survival and JFK\" But during the period that Dulles was still well-ensconced in the CIA, U.S. Marine Lee Oswald was stationed at Atsugi Air Force Base in Japan, where, in spite of his openly professed Marxism and \"admiration\" for the Soviet Union, he was given security clearances to relatively sensitive radar data connected with the CIA's U-2 flights over Russia. Additionally, since Atsugi AFB was home to the secret U-2 flights over the Soviet Union, it therefore had to have a secret CIA base hidden within the Air Force Base. General Reinhard Gehlen's West German Bundesnachrichtendienst (Federal Security Service) was apparently training foreign emigres as a paramilitary force to be dropped into the Soviet Union. Part of this training would doubtless have been in Russian, and part would have included knowledge of Communist doctrine, party organization, and how to \"pass oneself off\" as a committed Communist. This means that Oswald, if in fact he was being \"sheep dipped\" for an intelligence assignment in the Soviet Union, as Garrison himself believed, was likely being trained for the role by Gehlen's Organization and by former Nazis! In other words, all the elements converge at Atsugi, and in the person of Lee Harvey Oswald. In this connection it will be shown later that Oswald's \"address book\" contained more than just the addresses of FBI agents .... 7. South American Death Squads: The \"Kinder. Gentler Gestapo\" for Hire Having reviewed the Nazi situation, we are now in a better position to consider other details presented by Brussell, details that begin to hint of what the Nazi motivation and role may have been, in addition to all the other groups and their individual reasons for playing a role in the assassination might have been. When Brussell wrote her assassination piece for Larry FliJlt's The Rebel magazine on the twentieth anniversary of the assassination in 1983, she referred to a Senate Foreign Relations Committee report entitled \"Latin America: Murder Inc.,\" a report that she noted was \"still classified\" at the time of her article. 11 II Mae Brussell, \"The aZI Conneclion to the John F Kenncdy Assassination,\" p. 11. 396"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell Brussell indicated that the report stated that the U.S.A. 's intelligence community had \"joint operations\" with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay,\" known as \"Operation Condor.\" Brussell then explains the possible significance of the code name by citing a paragraph from a Jack Anderson column: Jack Anderson gave a few details in his column \"Operation Condor, An Unholy AJliance,\" August 3,1979: \"Assassination teams are centered in Chile. This international consortium is located in Colonia Dignidad, Chile. Founded by Nazis from Hitler's SS, headed by Franz Pfeiffer Richter, Adolf Hitler's 1000-year Reich may not have perished.\" Brussell then explains the historical connection of Operation Condor to these Nazi-trained and based South American Death squads: Otto Skorzeny code-named his assault on American soldiers in the Bartle of the Bulge Operation Greif, the \"Condor.\" He continued Condor with his post-war special teams that imposed \"sanctions,\" meaning the assassination of enemies. And lest one forget, Brussell reminds her readers of the serpents' nest of connections Skorzeny unlocks: SkorLeny's father-in-law was Hjalmar Schacht, president of Hitler's Reichsbank. Schacht guided Onassis' shipyards in rebuilding the German and Japanese war fleets. In 1950 Onassis signed on Lars Anderson for his whaling ships on the hunt of Antarctica and Argentina. Anderson had belonged to Vidkum Quisling's Nazi collaborationist group in Norway during the war. Clay Shaw, who was charged by New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison with complicity in the JFK assassination, was a close friend of Hjalmar Schacht. 12 This presents a very interesting, very nasty, picture. One can assume, once again, that the U,S, intelligence community's involvement with such groups as Colonia Dignidad was to use them as \"cut-outs\", accomplishing the necessary 12 Brussell, \"The Nazi Connection to the John F. Kennedy Assassination,\" p. II. 397"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"\"Mae Brllssellsprouts: Nazi Survival and JFK\" political assassination when necessary, and achieving \"plausible deniability\" when something went wrong. After all, who would believe that such an extensive network of Nazis still existed so long after the war? And who would believe that the American intelligence community was in cahoots with it? That was, after all, 1983, almost forty years after the end of the war. Who would believe that there were still Nazis well-enough organized and well- enough financed to run such South American continent-spanning covert operations? Who would believe that they were still even ideologically committed to Nazism after such a long period? But again, Jack Anderson's and Mae Brussell's picture presents yet another disturbing picture: one not only of such continued Nazi existence, but of its continued semi- or complete independence from the control of the u.s. or any Latin American government. Indeed, it would have been relatively easy for such professionally trained assassins to keep their own records and proofs of connections with these countries' intelligence services and governments to organized crime and murder and Latin America. In short, it would be a very easy thing for such independent Nazi colonies to blackmail their so-called masters with the threat of exposure. 8. George De Mohrenschildt When \"Marxist\" and Soviet defector Lee Harvey Oswald returned to the United States with Russian wife Marina in tow, he began to associate with some very un-Marxist and un-Communist characters, like East European emigrant and Texas oil geology businessman George DeMohrenschildt. DeMohrenschildt was unusual company for the supposedly poor Oswald to be running with, and he soon introduced Lee Harvey to Dallas' White Russian and \"tsarist\" community, where he and Marina were befriended by Ruth and Michael Paine. The Paines assisted Lee Harvey in obtaining his job at the Texas School Book Depository and he and Marina stayed with the Paines in their home.

Marlin Bormann and JFK Many assassination researchers have pointed out that when he was arrested, Lee Harvey Oswald's notebook contained the addresses of some very strange people for a \"lone nut assassin\" to be carrying around, people that included fBI agents among others. Other assassination researchers have pointed out that Oswald's \"Marxist\" connections have all the signatures of someone being prepared for a role, in this case, role of \"defector.\" However, with so many strange Nazi connections lurking in the background, surely somewhere along the long line of murder and \"coincidental deaths\" that followed the assassination the media lJ Mae Brussell. \"The Nazi Connection to the John f.

Yet, of the Nazi connection there has been next to nothing, and of the Nazi Connection in Oswald's notebook, absolutely nothing was said by the major American media. Yet, in 1976, a relatively popular book was published by then well-known investigative journalist Sybil Leek and Bert Sugar called The Assassination Chain, which had a foreward by none the less than famous syndicated columnist Jack Anderson. The book contained the following bit of information in a chapter called \"the Right-Wing Extremist Scenario:\" When Oswald was arrested, the FBI found his address book, and in it were the addresses of Major General Walker and George Lincoln Rockwell. These improbable names only add 10 the confusion of other addresses such as thal of FBI Agent Hosty, whose conncection with Oswald has never been cleared Up.15 Oswald was, of course, accused of trying to assassinate Major General Edwin Walker. But this would hardly explain Agent Hosty's presence in the address book, unless Oswald was either planning to assassinate him, or if General Walker's true role was something other than we have been told. But in any case, the real figure of interest is of course George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi Party. This seems so incongruously out of place as to be ridiculous, unless one recalls Brussell's allegations concerning the CIA's secret U-2 base at Atsugi Air Force Base in Japan, where Oswald was stationed, and where, according to Brussell, Reinhard Gehlen's \"Organization\" was recruiting and training paramilitary agents for covert operations inside the Soviet Union. But why not say something about it? Surely the address of the leader of the American Nazi Party would have cinched the case that Oswald was a \"lone nut\"! But one would /lot say something about it if in fact the connection was real, and revealed something about Oswald and the conspiracy to assassinate the president. \" Sybil Leek and Bert R. Sugar.

In this regard, there does exist evidence that Oswald was exposed to precisely some sort of German connection while in Japan. In one of the most bizarre assassination theory books to appear, author Lincoln Lawrence's Were We Controlled? makes the following point from the testimony of one of Oswald's Marine buddies to the Warren Commission, one Nelson Delgado, while they were both stationed in California. In his testimony, Nelson Delgado offers these startling thoughts for us to ponder on ...

But if the American media was silent about this aspect of the assassination, the European media was not. As Brussell indicates, In August 1971, a French paper headlined a news story, \"Martin Bonnann behind the Kennedy murders.\" It listed an international band of killers that was located in Texas. They carried out Ihe two assassinations at the German command. Six years later, June 8, 1977. the London Guardian reported, \"Bormann Linked with Kennedy Murder.\" This story was based on a new book titled Treason/or My Daily Bread by Mikhail Lebedev. Lebedev detailed how Martin Bonnann left Europe, established his current life in Paraguay, and how the fatal head shot 10 Kennedy was delivered by an agent paid by Bonnann, alias of Zed.\" As Brussell points out, these allegations of Nazi connections - known since the Torbitt document was discretely circulated in 1971 - and publicly known since Lebedev's book, and for that matter, Leek and Sugar's The Assassination Chain, both appeared while the House Select Committee on Assassinations was conducting its investigations to \"find the truth.\" Yet, the Nazi aspect of the story was the one subject that the Committee's Chief Consul, G. Robert Blakey, would never countenance, refusing \"to admit any research or documents on these subjects.,,18 In other words, one may speak of possible CIA involvement, of possible Mafia involvement, of the possible involvement of a disgruntled group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles, even of the possible involvement of disenchanted elements within the CIA and the American military, in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. But of the possible involvement of Nazis, one may never speak. \" Mae Brussell, \"The Nazi Connection to the John F Kennedy Assassination,\" p. 26. 18 Mae Brussell, \"The Nazi Connection to the John F Kennedy Assassination,\" p. 27. 402"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell 11. The \"Octopus\" Before the \"Octopus \": the Bunge CO/poration Beats Danny Casolaro by Two Decades But assuming that there was Nazi involvement in the Kennedy assassination, what was its motivation? That international bankers would have had motivations, in the retrospective of Kennedy's intention to bypass the Federal Reserve and authorize the printing and circulation of United States notes, seems clear enough. That the Mafia had its own motivations is also equally clear. After all, the Mafia had helped elect the Kennedy Administration, and suddenly it found itself confronted by a hostile Justice Department under Attorney General Robert Kennedy. The Anti-Castro Cubans had motivation, since Kennedy clearly had undertaken private commitments with the Soviet Union not to invade nor to sponsor covert operations designed to overthrow Castro. One may even see in the Anti-Castro forces a motivation for the similar involvement of at least the crypto-Nazi Eastern European emigre groups, such as the White Russian community in Dallas, to which Oswald was introduced by DeMohrenschildt. Such groups would have been low-level players, helping in the detail work to position the major players and cut-outs - people like Oswald himself - in their respective positions. Their motivation would have been clear: after the Bay of Pigs and Kennedy's \"betrayal\" of the Cuban emigre community, he had signaled clearly his opposition to the CIA's and military's \"rollback\" policy towards Communism, a policy that depended on these emigre fronts to fight proxy \"wars of liberation\" from their Communist masters. Everyone of the major alleged players in the assassination conspiracy has a clear and plausible motive for being there. Except for the Nazis. Their motivations seem obscure at best, since they seem cloaked behind all the other groups, at the very highest level, like the international bankers themselves, who would clearly have felt threatened by Kennedy's purpose to by-pass the Federal Reserve and create debt-free money. But even here, one can sense the high mystery. That there are strange, if not downright bizarre, connections to Nazis in the assassination should now be clear, yet, unlike even international banking, the Nazis seem to have no 403"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"\"Mae Brllssellsprouts: Nazi Survival and JFK\" interest whatsoever for involvement. Once again, one is back to the question of motivations. But therein also lies, perhaps, the key to their involvement, and their motivations. For if they lie hidden behind all these other groups, if in fact they - intended as a final deep cover \"cut-out\" layer - became the ultimate controllers who gave the final \"go\" order, as the European newspaper reports suggest by naming Bormann himself as the decision-maker, then one may speculate on their morivations. Clearly, to undertake such drastic action, one of two things, or a combination of both, would have had to be present: (I) Some policy or policies of President Kennedy was perceived as a threat to their interests; andlor (2) some advantage had to be gained by his elimination. As I shall argue below, if there is Nazi involvement, then I believe some combination of both is behind it. Again, Mae Brussell is the first prominent media personality to mention the tip of a German iceberg that may be the first clue to unraveling the mystery of Nazi involvement, and the even greater mystery of its motivations for such a hideous act. Discovering Lincoln Lawrence's book Were We Control!ed?J9 Brussell begins to follow the only big money trail known to exist in connection with the assassination: The stock market dropped 24 points in 27 minutes when news of President Kennedy's assassination was announced. 2.6 million shares were sold off. /t was the greatest panic since /929. Somebody made a hllge profit selling short in many markets. Somebody made half a billion dollars in one day. 10 That somebody, according to Lincoln Lawrence, was Bunge and Born, LDA, or simply, the Bunge Corporation.

The crash helped further drive the market down. 19 Referred to previously in its Adventures UnUmited Press reprint edition, Mind Control, Oswald, and JFK: Were We Controlled?

Back to this in a moment. While there are a number of factors that have not been recounted here - as for example the heavy role of \"mind control\" in Lawrence's speculations that Oswald, De Angelis, and Jack Ruby were all cynically manipulated by this German \"Group\" for the mere purpose of immense financial gain - there are a number of points that would tend to make one discount the whole scenario, the most basic of which was that the whole thing occurred merely for financial gain. But oddly, Lawrence himself hints at, though never again pursues or menlions, that the \"group\" behind his scenario had intellectual and \"scientific backgrounds,\" hinting in tum that there was possibly a motivation behind that of the motivation of financial gain. The money was to be used for something, something that, if one carefully reads between the lines of Lawrence's book, is scientific in nature. Of course, the Bell and similar projects would have required heavy financial outlays. And one would have needed such financial injections for independent projects Only when taken in a much wider context of the other major players in the conspiracy and their motivations does Lawrence's scenario not only make sense, but begins to hint at things that would have made azi involvement coalesce with the other elements: the Mafia, big business and banking, the military industrial complex, \"pissed-off' emigre groups, and so on.

As will be seen below, the financial picture and motivation of the assassination begin to connect other dots, dots that trace their spider-web-thin and tenuous but still clearly visible threads back to Germany, and World War Two. We will return to the subject of possible Nazi involvement and motivations in this bizarre scenario in a later section. But for now, there is one last connection that Mae Brussell exposes. 12. More Odd Behavior and Connections: West German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger, and Nixon The day after the assassination of President Kennedy, right- wing extremist, Major General Edwin Walker called Munich, Germany from his home in Shreveport, Louisiana. He called the Munich-based newspaper, the Deutsche National und Soldaten Zeitung (The German National and Soldiers' Times), a neo-nazi rag based in Munich. He called to tell them that Lee Harvey Oswald, the suspect in the assassination, was the same person that had tried to kill him by shooting through his window in April of 1963. 40 This is the same General Walker whose address, as mentioned above, was found in Oswald's address book, along with that of FBI agent James Hosty, and incongruously, that of American Nazi Party leader George Lincoln Rockwell. Conveniently, \"Marxist\" Oswald, having allegedly taken pot shots at Walker, was now accused of shooting and killing president Kennedy. The trouble is, as Brussell points out, \"there was never one shred of evidence, or a reliable witness, that could make this connection\" of Oswald to the General's would-be (and 40 Mae Brussel, \"The Nazi Connection to the John F. Kennedy Assassination,\" p. 30. 411"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"n1lfae Brussellsprollts: Nazi Survival and JFK\" unsuccessful) assassin. 41 Thus, as Brussell alleges, it became necessary for Ruth Paine to deliver a post-dated letter to Marina Oswald from Lee, implicating him in the attempt on General Walker and establishing him as a \"lone nut\" extremist capable of murdering prominent figures alone and unaided. 42 Pause and consider what framing Oswald for this act accomplishes, for it kills two birds with one stone. Firstly, it establishes him as a \"lone nut\". Secondly, it distances him from his right-wing extremist connections, since he is allegedly shooting at a right-wing extremist general. This in tum would make his alleged Marxist beliefs seem more genuine. But, asks Brussel, \"Why was General Walker in such a hurry to get his information printed in Germany before anybody in Dallas ever heard about it?\" Her answer is, even for Mae Brussell, somewhat unusual Kurt-George Kiesinger had just been installed as Chancellor of West Germany and Franz-Josef Strauss as finance minister. Kiesinger entered the radio propaganda division of Nazi Foreign Minister (Joachim) Von Ribbentrop at age 36. He was then directing a world-wide radio propaganda apparatus with 195 specialists under his supervision during the war. He was the liaison officer, coordinating his department's work with that of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels.\" Ln other words, Brussell is implying that the change in power in West Gennany was somehow linked to the assassination, and the assumption of power in the United States by Lyndon B. Johnson. But beyond this she does not speculate, and that is, for Mae Brussell, decidedly unusual. C. The JFK Connection in Early MAJIC-12 Documents If the Nazis were involved in the JFK assassination, then, as Lincoln Lawrence's speculative scenario avers, one motivation of 41 Ibid. \" Brussell, \"The Nazi Connection to the John F Kennedy Assassination,\" p. 30. 4' lbid. 412"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell their involvement was for financing to continue their scientific projects. As for the involvement itself, as was seen in the previous chapter, there are some documents in the Cooper-Cantwheel set of MAJlc-12 classified UFO papers that indicate a connection of at least the subject of UFOs to the assassination, via the memorandum addressed to General Charles Peare Cabell, one of the CIA bigwigs sacked by Kennedy allegedly for his involvement in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. General Cabell also had another connection besides that of the MAJlC- I2 group and his CIA association. He was intimately involved in Operation Paperclip, and his involvement was in connection with bringing over Nazi \"aviation doctors.\" Lest one forget who these doctors were, these were the ones performing grizzly and barbaric medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners to study effects on humans in extreme conditions, including outer space 44 Cahell's brother Earle was mayor of Dallas during the assassination, and was also instmmental in getting the motorcade route changed to make the detour that took Kennedy into the \"kill zone\" in front of the Texas School Book Depository and the Grassy Knoll. But the document itself suggests a technological and policy motive to the assassination may have underwritten at least the intelligence community's involvement in it, namely, the secret development of recovered technology, the public repression of similar technological development, and the creation of appropriate policies for public manipulation. Kennedy, by threatening to smash the CIA, threatened this agenda with exposure, and that meant, in tum, exposure of Paperclip and how deeply cormpted American intelligence and defense had become. [n short, Kennedy threatened - doubtless inadvertently - the whole continuing Nazi enterprise. One may also view tbis in connection with the Two Space Programs Hypothesis. If indeed Kennedy was serious about limited cooperation in space with the Soviets, then this too would have threatened aspects of America's - and perhaps the Soviets' own version of the - secret space program with exposure. 44 Tom Bower, The Paperclip Conspiracy: The Hunt for the Nazi Scientists (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company: )987), p. 245. 413"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"nil/ae Brussellsprou(s: Nazi Survival and JFK\" And finally, what of all the lurking involvement not only of Nazis, but of big oil? Why this strange coalescence? If there was a continued development of the technology represented by the Bell- and the Bell and its strange effects were very real - then \"the Brotherhood\" would have had a final, crowning, motivation: they would have acted not only to continue the secret development and hoarding of such technology for themselves but also to maintain the reliance of everyone else on petroleum, using some of those profits to fund that continued technological development, and the suppression of any open and independent development of such technology. So, if Bunge Corporation pocketed major financial profits from the assassination, then, clearly, this was an after-thought: \"If we're going to do this to protect our interests, why not make a little money on the affair too?\" [t is in this context that two other MAJlc-12 documents should be viewed: the alleged letter from Cooper's anonymous source indicating that President Nixon had \"privatizing\" the alleged UFO \"study group,\" giving credence to the idea that its massive intelligence operations and covert technology development, and public technology repression efforts, fell into, if were not originally in, independent hands. Similarly there are hints in this letter as well as in the burned \"Annex C\" that not only was President Kennedy eliminated because of the threat he posed to this group and its programs, but that Secretary of War James Forrestal was murdered for similar reasons as well. I. Guy Bannister, UFOs, and JFK As if all this were not enough, there is yet one more strange connection between the Kennedy assassination, UFOs, advanced technology, and the Nazis.

One of the persons surely near the center, as the European newspaper articles cited by Brussell suggest, was Martin Bonnann, fonner Nazi Party Reichsleiter, financial administrator both of the Party's and Hitler's own personal fortunes, ever-present shadow to the Fiihrer, and mastermind of the Nazi \"strategic evacuation\" plans. While not suggesting that Bormann is the only high-ranking member of the decision-making oligarchy that conspired to murder the President, ifthere is a Nazi involvement, and so many disparate sources suggest there is, then Borman.n surely was a member of the planning and decision-making level of that group.

But in any case, Bormann is a crucial figure, for after the beginning of actual wartime hostilities and Hitler's ever-growing preoccupation with, and meddling in, Germany's military operations, Bormann was left as the de faCiO day-to-day ruler of Nazi Germany, the gray eminence, the real power behind Hitler's dark throne. I. Bormann and Ingotsladl: A Connection to Ihe IIIuminali? To appreciate Bormann's significance, it is best to recall that besides his role as party leader and treasurer, he was also an SS Obergruppenfiihrer. This would make Bormann - like Kammler and Mazuw - a probable member of Himmler's \"initiates\" into the SS's so-called \"occult secrets and mysteries.\" One has difficulty imagining the pragmatic and cynical Bormann involved in such rinlals for any other purpose than to placate Himmler, and to keep an eye on his most serious rival for power. In spite of this, Bonnann, of all the leading Nazis, is the one figure that is the most shrouded in mystery and contradictions. While finding it difficult to believe that Bormann could be anything less than cynical in his approach to Himmler's fascination with the occult - recall that it is because Bormann kept such faithful notes of Hitler's \"table talk\" that we know at all that Hitler regarded Himmler's obsession with such things as \"nonsense\" - it is nonetheless remotely possible that Bormann was a very high initiate into his own secret society affiliations, for he had acquired a home after the Nazi assumption of power, near the town of Ingolstadt, which remained his legal residence throughout the war. For those who do not know the significance ofIngolstadt, it is the birthplace - on May 1, 1776 - of one of the most notorious secret societies in history: the Bavarian Illuminati of Ingolstadt University professor Adam Weishaupt. Given that Bormann's boss at the lime was one Rudolf Hess, a man known to be steeped in and obsessed with occult lore and secret societies of every stripe imaginable, it is difficult to believe that Bormann would not have 416"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell known this aspect of the history of the town he had chosen to make home. a. Bormann's Manipulation of Hitler Some have speculated that Adolf Hitler's extraordinary power over masses, and his extraordinary charisma and skill as an orator, came from some occult influence in his life. To a certain extent, this is true, for it is known that Hitler did obtain the assistance of individuals, such as the rhetorician Hanussen, trained in the use of ges/llres to accompany words, a school of rhetoric with its own occult and esoteric associations. Beyond this, however, nothing at all is known of Hitler's initiation into any secret society, though most scholars have speculated upon it 49 If Hitler's evident ability to sway the masses of Germany with pageantry and brilliant rhetoric was evidence of any occult association, however, then Bormann's evident skill in manipulating Hitler - while seemingly his servant - must be taken as the manipulation of the king by the court magician. What was Bormann's source of power over the man who held such power over Germany and Europe? One very plausible explanation was given by William Stevenson in his book, The Bormann Brotherhood. The Jew as the source of all evil haunted Adolf Hitler, who feared that his own blood was 'tainted.' This led to tbe brutat murder of his niece and mistress (Geli Raubal). The details were lost at the time, for the 3zis were already on the march and violent killings became the order of the day .... It was only when Bonnann's disappearance became a matter for serious conjecture, and imelligence agents began to go into the ugly details, that an incredible episode in Hitler's life came to light. This explained exactly how M.8rtin Bannann was able to gather into his hands all the strings required to make Hitler dance to his rune.\" 49 l shall offer evidence. from a source, in this chapter. however, that Hitler was initiated into one such secret society after his appointment as Chancellor by Field Marshal President Paul Von Hindenburg. 5{1 \\Villiam Stevenson, The Bormann Brotherhood (New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovitch: t 973), p. 29. 417"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":".,Jllae Brussellsprouts: Nazi Survival and JFK li Like many others examining the \"suicide\" of Geli Raubal, Stevenson speculates that Adolf Hitler, in a fit of blind rage after Geli had threatened to expose the fact that his ~randmother had born a child from Baron Rothschild of Vienna, I had killed his niece with a pistol, and then fled the scene in panic, and appealed to Bonnann for Help. Bonnann assured his Fiihrer that it would be \"taken care of\". It had to be, for obviously, a murder investigation of Hitler was a considerable impediment if the Nazis were ever to assume power. At this point, Bonnann begins his rise to power, by somehow persuading the local police investigator of the murder, a man named Miiller, to cover up the murder in return for favors and advances. And thus was born an alliance between Martin Bonnann and one of Nazi Germany's other \"hidden powers\" behind the throne, for Miiller went on to become the notorious \"Gestapo Miiller\", making the Gestapo's extensive files on just about everybody not only available to his immediate boss, the Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler, but also to Bonnann, who thus had up to the minute intelligence on his biggest rival and his entire department of the Nazi government. Bonnann, in fact, according to Stevenson, had initiated, via Gestapo Miiller, no less than four private and discreet investigations of Hitler's family lines and his Jewish blood and descent, all without Hitler's knowledge. The blackmail value that all this information would have had for Bonnann was incalculable, and accounts for his ability to draw into his hands \"all the strings\" to make Hitler \"dance to his tune\". Indeed, Stevenson's own characterization of Bonnann's role in this regard is oddly reminiscent of the language of another man, writing in the I 920s, long before Hitler came to power. But before that, there is something else. Gestapo Miiller was directly responsible for the blanket of security belts around SS \" The story first surfaced in the book The Mind of Adolf Hitler, supposedly based upon a secret psychological profile of the Fuhrer prepared for President Franklin Roosevelt. The allegation that Anna Maria Schickelgruber, one of Hitler's grandmothers, had an affair with her employer Baron Rothschild and bore an illegitimate child of him, was the subject of a secret dossier prepared on Hitler by the Austrian Chancellor Dolfuss prior to the Nazi annexation of that nation before the war. 418"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell Obergruppenjiihrer Hans Kammler's \"think tank\" in Prague 51 In other words, Bormann, through his friend Gestapo MUlier, was faultlessly well-informed about the extent and nature of Nazi secret weapons research. Indeed, he, Bormann, was the real master of it all. But what of the language of \"dancing to a tune\"? What man first used such language in association with Nazis? The man is senior occultist and member of the Thule Society - the secret society that midwifed the Nazi party into existence - Dietrich Eckhart, who told his disciples shortly before his death to \"Follow Hitler: he will make the world dance, but it is we who have written the tune.\" All this marks Bormann as a possible practitioner of the most classic fonn of occult black magic: the secret control and manipulation of weak people (Hitler) through their weaknesses and fears. And Bormann's own choice of Tngolstadt as a home mirrors perhaps a deeply hidden association of its own, for after World War One, Bormann, like many disenchanted German veterans, joined one such society, the Society Against Presumptuousness of Jewry53 Tn any case, these odd characteristics of the two Nazi leaders would tend to fuel the theory of some that Hitler was deliberately manipulated and placed into power, and secretly manipulated behind the scenes by more powerful forces than even he publicly wielded, and, when he had served his purpose, was deliberately sabotaged and cast aside. b. Bormann's Surrender of the A-Bomb to the USA: The Hydrick Thesis In any case, it is Bormann's role in establishing the secret strategic evacuation plans for Nazism after its military collapse that interests us here. It was evident to Bormann, as to other high- ranking Nazis, that after the disaster of Stalingrad in early 1943, it was only a matter of time before the military collapse of the Reich if its secret weapons projects did not bear fruit in time.

As regards scientific matters, there is an interesting fact presented in Linda Hunt's book The United States Government, Nazi Scientists, and Project Paperclip, J 945 to J 990. In that book, Hunt gives the following account of how the United States was so quickly able to find and acquire the German scientists and technologies it sought in connection with Project Paperclip: One of JlOA Director Gruhn's first actions as overall administrator of the project was to compile a hiring list of the best-qualified Gennan and Austrian scientists that was used by both the United States and Great Britain as a recruitment tool for decades. Although this list has been mentioned in the past by journalists and historians, no one ever noted that it was partially compiled by Werner Osenberg. the notorious wartime commander of the Gestapo's scientific section. The decision to use Osenberg was made by U.S. Navy Captain Ransom Davis after consultation with the (Joint Chiefs of Staff). During the war, Osenberg was in charge of a special 5S research council directly subordinate to Reichsmarschal Herman Goring. Osenberg sent his Gestapo agents to investigate work in progress at scientific institutes and report back on each scientist's political reliability. From those reports and the Gestapo's jiles, Osenberg compiled a list offifteen thousand \"ames of scientists in the Third Reich. He wrote comments next to the scietlfists' names regarding their political affiliations. such as 55 membership, and his opinion of their scientific abilities. Of course, those scielllists who held fanatic Nazi views and S5 membership were also those whom Osenberg considered best qualified. Osenberg had been captured in 1945 by the Alsos team and interned in a camp in Germany. Soon after the JIOA expressed an interest in him, intelligence officers whisked him out of Gennany to Versailles, France, where he set up business as usual, sifting through his files to suggest names of those he considered the best scientists in the Third Reich.\" 54 Linda Hunt, The United StOles Governme11l, Nazi Scientists, and Project Paperclip. 194510 1990 (New York: 51.

Thus, while Rimmler may have, at one time, tried to keep Bormann out of the loop on the extent of Nazi secret weapons research being conducted by the 55, he would have known about it via other private channels available to him. 3. Bormann was thus faultlessly well-informed not only of the state and extent of these projects - and therefore, not only knew of Germany's atom bomb project and its actual state, but of the more exotic areas of research represented by the Bell - but also of the political reliability of the scientists conducting the research. 4. With such a list in hand, Bormann and his allies in the strategic evacuation operation would have known exactly who, and what, was to go where, and, via their knowledge of each individual person's political views and loyalty, could have limited the risks to any planned continued independent development of the projects already begun, as well as of any planned infiltration of any host country's military and intelligence angencies.

Finally, the Osenberg list and evident American interest in it seems to corroborate another speculation, namely, that American knowledge and the nature of its specificity, as reflected in General Patton's unerring military drives to the nerve centers of Kammler's secret research departments, could only have come from inside Nazi Germany itself. Since Caner Hydrick has argued a convincing case that it was Bormann himself who directed the surrender of Germany's atom bomb secrets to the United States, it may be reasonably asserted that it was Bormann ultimately coordinating the flow of other sensitive information concerning the Kammlerstab to American intelligence, since he, clearly, is in the position to be the best informed about the nature, extent, and personnel involved with all of Germany's black projects. With this knowledge at his disposal, the thesis of Carter Hydric, that Bormann helped engineer not only the transference of the enriched uranium of the U-boat 234 to the United States, but also that he may have engineered the transference of a functioning bomb to the United States as well, gains credibility55 One odd occurrence - one again not in harmony with the post- war Allied Legend about German incompetence in nuclear bomb engineering - is the fact that German physicist Rudol f Fleischmann was flown to the USA for interrogation prior to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 56 Why the urgent need to consult a German physicist prior to bombing Japan?

As was seen in my earlier book, Jane's Defence Weekly author and journalist Nick Cook, following the research of Igor Witkowski, notes that Bonnann had established this command, placed it under the direct jurisdiction of SS General Hans Kammler, and also placed a special Luftwaffe unit of ultra-long range Junkers transport aircraft also under his exclusive command. After the establishment of this command, whose aircraft were, \"coincidentally\" based in Lower Silesia, Kammler, the Bell, all associated papers concerning the Bell, and the enonnous Ju 390 that most probably carried it out of Gennany, disappeared completely.

Continuation of Ultra-Black Projects and German \"Independence\" at White Sands and NASA Whatever their engineering skills may have been, the German scientists at NASA also appeared to be very adept at political maneuvering as well. We have already noted in chapter three how Werner Von Braun himself managed quickly to befriend not only J. Edgar Hoover, but the powerful Democratic Majority leader in the US Senate, Lyndon Baines Johnson, a man whose views on the necessity for space travel, and space militarization, are well- known. German independence from their American hosts became apparent very early on, in the so-called \"Juarez Incident,\" where a modified V-2 of extended range was test fired at White Sands. The project was called, oddly enough, Project Hennes, and was under the direction of Paperclip scientist Ernst Steinhof. The rocket went astray, and landed in Juarez, Mexico. Steinhof, who could have ordered the rocket destroyed in mid-flight when it went off course, did not do so. 423"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"\"Mae Brllsse/lsprouts: Nazi Survival alld JFK\" The controversy over the Juarez incident overshadowed a more serious problem at White Sands and Fon Bliss Army base in Texas. What happened there is a flaring example of the military's total lack of control over enemy aliens who were judged to be a threat to the internal security of the United States. Even thougb there were allegations of sabotage and evidence of gross violations of base security, as one intelligence agent bluntly put it, there was absolutely \"no attempts to place them in anything like custody.\" Anny officers in charge of the group maintained little or no surveillance over the Gennans' activities either on or off the base. 57 Later on, the German paperclip scientists at NASA under Debus, Von Braun, Arthur Rudolf and others in fact showed so much independence that an entirely different concern began to manifest itsel f. James Webb, NASA's second administrator, complained that the Germans were circumventing the system by attempting to build the Saturn V in~house at the center. Rocco PetTone, who became the Marshall Director in 1973, said that Webb felt the group needed to be more tightly managed. 58 In other words, the Paperclip Germans were attempting to circumvent the normal contract and bidding process of the American government and, using NASA itself as the constructing agency, build the giant Saturn V Apollo boosters on their own. Perhaps they were simply fed up with the bidding process and bureaucratic inertia. Or perhaps there was a more sinister agenda. But the news from France was not good either.

The connections, and associations, have played significant roles in American politics as well, as is evident in the fallout from Operation Paperclip, the Kennedy assassination, and even its much more limited role in the election of Presidents Reagan and G.H.W. Bush. But there may be a far older association, a far older historical pedigree, one dating back to the Hohenstaufen Emperors of Germany, and to their global imperialistic ambitions. In 1943, while World War Two was raging in its full fury, an American author published a little-known and long-forgotten book called The Thousand Year Conspiracy: Secret Germany Behind the Mask. 64 The author's name was Paul Winkler, and he sought to explain the most fundamental mystery of World War Two - and indeed, in a certain sense, of World War One as well - and that was, what on earth had happened to the Germans? The Germans, Winkler was careful to point out, were no more or less warlike than any other people. Germany had exercised a profound cultural influence on the formation of the \"Western ethos\": engineers and musicians and physicists and biologists all studied German before the war, and clamored to enter her universities. Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Schumann, Schubert, Brahms, Durer, Luther, Einstein, Planck, and on and on the list could go, of famous Germans who profoundly enriched human expenence. Yet, that was the mystery, for while being no more or less warlike as a people than anyone else, when they did go to war, they did it.. .. they did it well. And with Nazism, it seemed to many as if something in the genius of the German people had gone quite insane, that some \"ethnic character defect\" had become so pathological that many called for the actual sterilization and extermination of Gennans after the war. Indeed, serious plans were 64 Paul \\Vinkler.

But for Winkler, Nazism, and Germany's well-known ability to wage war, was \"not the product of some 'spontaneous generation' crystallized by Hitler's evil genius\" nor was it \"simply a reaction to tbe harsh terms of the Versailles treaty\" nor did it derive \"from some basic trait in the German character.,,65 For Winkler, Nazism was tbe manifestation of something far older, and far more sinister. It was the manifestation of a millenium's long secret conspiracy. It was, in short, a \"secret society gone public.\" In 1921 .... during one of the sessions of the Bavarian 'Landtag' (Pariliamentl, the Deputy Gareis, with a heavy pile of documents in his hands, made a statement to the other Deputies which none of them seemed able to understand: <I have here the evidence of a thousand years' conspiracy - evidence which I shall present to you shortly.' A few days later Gareis was murdered. The criminal escaped punishment and the incident was practically forgonen. The evidence to which Gareis referred was never revealed. 66 But this incident was enough to fuel Winkler's own quest to reconstruct what Deputy Gareis had unearthed. What Gareis had unearthed, was not a defect in Germany, but rather, a defect that dominated Germany: Prussia and \"Prussianism.\" Winkler comments as follows: For LIS, 'Prussianism' goes back to the early part of the thineenth century and is still very much alive in our day. It is tire heir of the world-embracing ambitions of the Carolingians and 'Holy Roman' Emperors - but at the same time it is also what it became during the centuries in the stuffy and nauseating hot-house of East Prussia.

The \"Fehmic orgamizations\" that Winkler refers to are the Helige Vehme, which were secret imperial courts established by tbe German Holy Roman Emperors and their supporters in the various principalities and duchies, primarily Westphalia, that were to hand out and deliver death sentences to anyone convicted of treason against the empire. Tbey were, in a sense, also secret societies, since membership was by invitation-initiation. But in any case, Winkler points tbe finger at something very significant, and usually completely ignored by bistories of Nazism, even by those predisposed to view Nazism as a primarily occult or esoteric phenomenon. Tbat something is the deep secret society connection of Nazism to the old Teutonic Knights, themselves founded by the mediaeval German Emperors to further their imperialistic ambitions. At a time when tbe Papacy and the German Emperors were locked in mortal combat and when the Papacy could call on its own \"shock troops\" in the form of the \"military orders\" like the Templars or Knights Hospitaliter of St. John, the German Emperors sought to create their own imperial version. The process began when \"Emperor Frederick Barbarossa of the Hohenstaufen family had himself proclaimed 'master of the world,' Dominus Mundi, in 1158 in the fields of Roncaglia during his second campaign in Italy.,,68 In order to offset the papal advantage with its military orders, the German Emperors created their own version, supporting \"the formation of the purely German-armed Order of the Teutonic Knights:,69 This was acbieved through a long-tern] deception, for initially the Order was founded with but vague ties to the Empire in order to secure the necessary papal blessing \"indispensable to its prestige.,,7o Nonetheless, the Emperors managed to see that the head of the order during tbese 67 Wink.ler.

Winkler continues the story: Early in 1226 a fonnal invitation from Conrad arrived at the Order. Von Salza consulted with (Emperor) Frederick II at once and the latter. in his Bull of Rimini. entrusted von Salza with an imperial 'mission' for his future campaign. This BulL ... Was the very basis for all future action of the Teutonic Knights; a pennanent charter for all Prussian conquest. and all Gennan political expansion whjch, during the centuries to come and until this day, was to radiate from that territory.:'3 In other words, if one follows the logic closely, an organization had a legal charter - a charter never revoked by competent authority that could claim descent Fom the original granting authority - for conquest. And that organization was, by definition, a military secret society whose core ideology was the establishment of a world empire with German, with Prussian, hegemony at its heart and beight. The Bull of Rimini may be taken then as the de facto founding of the Order that would play such a role in European geopolitics for centuries to come. But equally important is the figure of the \"renaissance man\" Emperor Frederick II, well-known for his indulgence of scholars and sciences deemed esoteric by any standards, and certainly by the standards of the mediaeval Latin Church. Frederick liked to model his behavior on his famous 71 Winkler, rhe Tho/lsand- Year Conspiracy: Secret Germany Behind the Mask. p. 35. \" Ibid. 7J Ibid. 431"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"\"Mae Brussellsprouts: Nazi Survival and JFK\" grandfather Frederick Barbarossa/ 4 and also maintained \"that the Teutonic Knights had been founded by Barbarossa, a claim which seems to have no justification in fact.,,75 While Frederick II might have been trying to vest his Teutonic Knights with the aura of Barbarossa, and have invented this fact, it nonetheless cannot be discounted that he might have also let slip the real founder of the Order.

The Hohenzollems Become Grand Masters of the Order But by the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, northern German cities formed the trading league known as the Hansa, or Hanseatic League, in part to overthrow the rule of the Order in cities along Germany's eastern Baltic coast. This was successful. With its fortune and military power declining, the Order was approached by a new ally - indeed its only ally in this period - the Margrave of Brandenburg, Frederick von Hohenzollern. 77 The two - the Order and the Hohenzollern Margravate - entered into a pact to give assistance to each other against the subjects of each. And thus was born the unusual alliance between the house of Hohenzollern and the old Prussian noble interests represented by the Order. As a result of this relationship, by 151 I Albert von Hohenzollern und Brandenburg was elected to the Grand Mastership of the order, a \"post he filled with full understanding of the Order's traditions and ambitions.,,78 As Grand Master, Albert von Hohenzollern secularized the order in 1525 by transforming it into the hereditary Duchy of Prussia. 79 The \"secret society\" 74 Winkler, Tire Thollsand-Year Conspiracy: Secret Germany Behind the Mask, p. 47. 75 Ibid. 76 Ib'd -1 1 \" p.:> . 77 Ibid., p. 79. 78 Ibid .. 79 Ibid. 432"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"The 55 Brotherhood of the Bell component of the Order lived on in name, and also spawned several offshoot secret societies among the Junker nobility class in Prussia, one of which, the \"Society of Lizards\", maintained the Order's original imperial designs as well as esoteric doctrines. so But then Winkler asks the all-important question: One may ask whether there is an acu131 secret organization behind the Junkers and Prusso-Teutonics or whether the familiar Prusso-Teutonic organizations are responsible for the sequence of events presented in this book. Really secret organizations seldom betray their existence by outward signs. evertheless the founding of the secret 'Society of Lizards' (Eidechsengesellschaft) is an historical fact. Reliable historians have related how this society tried to pull the stTings in Prussia while the Order of the Teutonic Knights still existed. Kotzebue attributes to the activities of this secret society the secularization of Prussia. The unilinear evolution which has taken place since then - in Prussia and in a Gennany dominated by Prussia - and which corresponds point by point to lhe basic principles of the Society of Lizards might be considered sufficient circumstantial evidence of the survival of a secret Prusso-Teutonic organization right down to our time. But there is more. The entire process of Prussian growth seems to be inspired by an uninterrupted organic plan .... No interruption in the logic of events is observable, however, even since the time when the order ceased to manage the affairs of Prussia .... Our circumstantial evidence goes further: Gemlany \\\\las defeated in 1918 and the old ambitious plans of the Prussian elemems seemed shattered forever; yet within a fe\\v months somebody, somewhere, behind the curtains in Gennany, made decisions of the highest importance. These decisions meant revival of the old Fehme, the organization of systematic terror planned to undermine the young German Republic and to facilitate Germany's secret rearmament. So- called 'secret societies' sprang up from one day to the other all over Germany - societies which were secretive as regards the details of their decisions and activities, but whose existence itself was a secret from nobody. All these secret societies were closely connected among themselves; and there was no rivalry between them. Their activities complemented each other wonderfully.

Hiller's Only Known Initiation Here the story takes on another bizarre tum, a tum that is the only known verification of what many have long suspected: that Hitler was a secret society initiate, at some time and some place. But Winkler's version of the story points not to the usual suspects - the Thulegeselischaft and its shady associations with Viennese esotericists and racists Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels - but to the old Teutonic Knights: At the end of the nineteenth century, Emperor Wilhelm II, who was nurtured on the traditions of the Prusso- Teutonic Order, actually reestablished tbis Order in Prussia and Germany. The descendonts oj those who, acting in the Society oj Lizords, displaced the ancient Order from Pntssia - and contributed thlls to its disintegration - now claimed Jar themselves the right to appear cloaked in the dignity oj those whose p/aee they had taken .... Not much was said about the activities of the revived Order, but its yearly conventions in East Prussia were generally noted by the German newspapers. A Jew months afier the beginning oj the present war, a short notice appeared in German papers announcing that Hitler himself had been initiated inta the Teutonic Order. No information is published about the internal organization of the contemporary .Prusso-Teutonic Order, nor about its exact connections with what - if it still exists - is the present·day survival of the Society of Lizards . ... .In this connection it is interesting to note that in May, 1924, when the 700 ,h anniversary of the University of Naples, a University founded by Emperor Frederick II, was celebrated, a crown was found near the sarcophage of the Emperor in the Cathedral of Palermo with the following inscription: ~'Seinem Kaiser und HeIden Das geheime Deutschland\" (\"To Their Emperor and Hero, From Secret Germany\") 81 Winkler, The Thousand~Year Conspiracy: Secret Germany Behind the Mask, p. 236, 434"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"The 55 Bro/her/rood of/he Bell If we assume the existence of a Secret Germany, the open Junker organizations like the Reichs-Landbund and the Herrenklub - which also derive from the Order of the thirteenth cenlury ~ have only a secondary role, carrying out instructions of the secret group like all the other recently established societies which we have mentioned. But even if we disregard the circumstantial evidence which proves the actual survival of Secret Gennally, we must admit that a straight line can be detected between the Teutonic Order of tbe thirteenth century and the Germany of today.\" In other words, Kaiser Wilhelm II could well afford to abdicate the imperial throne in 1918 at the end of World War One, and go into exile in Holland, for, as Grand Master of whatever secret society entity still existed in Prussia, he and the Hohenzollerns and the Prussian imperialist interests they represented still exercised power and influence behind the scenes. And in any case, the purpose of the initiation of Hitler into this order is clear enough: the bargain had been made with the public political party that would best carry through its secret ambitions. And what of Bormann? All of this would have been known to him as well. And it should come as no surprise that this ideology of world domination by an elite also forms the motivation of another secret society, one with its own Germanic connections: Skull and Bones. F. Final Thoughts So, if the Nazis, a \"Brotherhood of the Bell,\" were involved with the assassination of President Kennedy - and a circumstantial case has been presented that they were, and at a very high level - then what motivated their involvement? The previous chapters have outlined a case that this motivation consisted of several factors, each one alone a sufficient reason for their involvement, and that, taken together, tend to increase the probability that they were involved at the deepest and highest levels of the conspiracy: 82 \\Vinkler, The Thousand-Year Conspiracy: Secret Germany Behind rhe Mask. pp. 236-238, emphasis added. 435"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":". .l41ae Brllsse/lsproUls: Nazi Survival and JFX\" I. They were involved to protect the technology that they had developed during the war, and its continued quasi- independent or independent development. This was threatened by Kennedy in any number of ways, by his attempt to smash the CIA, which provided a useful cover for some of their political activities, to his attempt to establish limited cooperation with the Soviets in space. If there was an alternative technology of propulsion involved in the Apollo program, and specifically with the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module), such cooperation might have revealed to the Soviets, bitter enemies of the Nazis, a component of their technology as well as their program of its continued secret development. 2. They were involved to protect their bases offinancial and political operation. not only within and behind the various Federal agencies and American corporations which they had infiltrated, but also within and behind the various other host countries - particularly in Latin America - that any degree of exposure, such as \"smashing the CIA\" might have caused, would have threatened. 3. If one posits a connection between an ongoing \"Nazi [nternational\" and international organized crime, as is likely since drug running, gambling, and so on would be easy means for funding and laundering money for black projects, then the actions of the Kennedy administration against organized crime would also constitute a threat to these interests. 4. If the actions of the Bunge Corporation in massive short- selling on the day of the assassination are an indicator of a deeper Nazi involvement - and it must not be forgotten that Bunge was at that time a German company with headquarters in Argentina - then a subsidiary motivation offers itself, though one that did not enter into the primary calculations for the murder: financial gain.

Finally, though not discussed, such a public murder would have an inevitable demoralizing effect on the American psyche, it would serve as a reminder that the hidden elite can remove anyone, at any time, any where, and get away with it. It was a warning, even to the rich and powerful like the Kennedy family, not to attempt to dismantle the loci of power they had put into place to ensure their own continued accretion of power, wealth, and influence. Whether the Nazis initiated this conspiracy, or later wormed their way into it, is in the final analysis immaterial. But it is clear that they were involved, and at some very deep level. And of all the groups with connections to the assassination conspiracy - Mafia, disgruntled anti-Castro Cubans, big business, big oil, threatened Federal Reserve shareholders, the military- industrial-intelligence complex, the space program, each group with its own motivation for killing the President - one thing stands out most clearly, when one considers all the evidence.

From one perspective, that represented by the epigraph above, it was the latest in a long line of organizations designed to suppress alternative energy sources in a history of suppression that began in the nineteenth century, and really took firm root with J.P. Morgan's suppression of Nikola Tesla early in the twentieth century. But that is a simplistic picture. The SS Brotherhood of the Bell was the entire organization of secret research - and the security to protect it - that was developed by the Third Reich in conjunction with its secret weapons projects. That this group intended its existence and research to continue after the war is evidenced by the measures it took to protect the secrets of the Bell by murdering most of its research team, and by spiriting the Bell itself and its project documentation out of Europe to ..... to wherever it went. From the historical perspective, the \"SS Brotherhood of the Bell\" is both reality and a symbol. As a symbol, it is a sign of what happens when a network of cartels and greedy power-hungry businessmen decide that they know what is best for everyone else, and put into power a political party whose ideology is in consonance with their own grotesque designs for a \"New World Order,\" who plan the rise, rule of terror, and dizzy fall of a world military super-power all within the lightening fast period of twelve years. In that sense, too, the Third Reich was perhaps a dress rehearsal. I Tom Bearden, Energy From 'he Vacuum: Concepts and Principles.

It is likewise the first documented case of the genuine existence of an alternative and very secret technology. Similarly, it is the first historical example of the measures taken not only to secretly develop it, but also to suppress any thoughts or inclinations toward an open development of its full potential. The \"55 Brotherhood,\" like its Teutonic Knights forebears, did not hesitate to murder in order to protect the instruments of its hegemony. In yet another sense, the 55 Brotherhood of the Bell is also the first bistorical example of a \"Military Assessment Joint Intelligence Committee;\" or, to put it more succinctly and familiarly, the Brotherhood of the Bell is the first real example of a kind of MAJlc-12 group, a group tasked with tbe secret development of technology and with security and disinformation campaigns designed to deflect attention of anyone who might get too close, and when that fails, to eliminate the interloper. Whether or not this Brotberhood infiltrated the later MAJlc-12 group or indeed became its nucleus, there is little doubt that a connection exists, and my intuition tells me it may have been a component in its initial formation. In chapters five and six, argumentation was presented that the Bell represented perhaps the first known \"scalar\" device, a device most probably intended by the Germans to be a breakthrough in propulsion. It certainly was that, and in this instance, the Brotberhood of the Bell may likewise be seen to be the first historical example of a genuinely secret space program. In this regard, recall the significance of the fact that Dr. Kurt Debus, a member of the Peenemiinde rocket team - Nazi Germany's \"open\" space program - was also a member of the Bell's research team, a very hidden and secret project. In any case, as a proto-scalar device, its weaponization potential, if not initially planned on or realized by the Germans, was quickly perceived by tbem. Of that there can be no doubt, since its classification as Kriegsenlscheidend clearly indicates their perception of its potential as a weapon or weapons platform. Its 439"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"\" What is the Brotherhood o/the Bell?\" significance as a proto-scalar device would thus seem to render Tom Bearden's following extensive remarks about the suppression of alternative physics and technology - and who is behind it - more significant. Bearden's remarks, cited extensively below, should be read not only for their intrinsic worth, but in the context of what has preceded in this book, for they are characteristic of the operation of any \"Brotherhood of the Bell\". And yes, in addition to these many \"petty\" little conspiracies, there really is a great conspiracy - in fact, there are many of them. Churchill just referred to the entire set of conspiring cartels as the \"High Cabal.\" This is a loose-knit set of extraordinarily wealthy cartels that between them control much of the financial power of the world. You can only find the principals behind a couple of hundred of interlocking corporations, if you penetrate deeply enough. Much of their great financial income comes from the control of energy at its various levels, through a net of interlocking corporations. Something like $2 trillion dollars per year is their \"take\" from energy worldwide. Oil plays a great role in that. These \"high cabal\" fellows make or break nations financially, as is almost being done to Argentina as this is being written. They also have been stopping (Coefficient of Performance greater than unity) electrical power systems since shortly after the tum of the century, using whatever means are necessary - fair or foul. That is why we are still burning oil, coal, and natural gas, and why our automobiles and trucks run off gasoline and diesel, and not off free electrical energy from the vacuum. The high cabal intends to keep it that way. Some of the major primary means of \"stopping\" invention have been as follows: a. Manipulation and improper use of the law (Gray's production line was shut down by law officers before his engines could roll off there and onto the market). b. Involving the unsuspecting inventor in drug charges by planting drugs on his property surreptitiously, then secretly notifying the drug enforcement officials who suddenly raid the premises and discover the narcotics, resulting in the inventor going ro jail since he had been caught \"red-handed.\" c. Threatening the inventor's life and the lives of his family, to frighten him away from what he is doing. d.

Nick Redfern's FBI Documents on Nazis and UFOs UFOlogist Nick Redfern is one of few \"mainstream UFOlogists\" that has at least given the Nazi angle on the early UFO phenomenon a hearing. In fact, he has done more than just give it a hearing, but devoted a whole chapter to it in his book The F.B.!. Files: The FBI's UFO Top Secrets Exposed. Before addressing the issue of FBI involvement in this malter, let us first acquaint ourselves with those few tantalizing facts on this emotive issue. Consider the following, extracted from a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report of27 May 1954: ·'A German newspaper (not further identified) recently published an interview with George Klein, famous Gennan engineer and aircraft expert, describing the experimental construction of 'nYlng saucers' carried out by him from 1941 to 1945. Klein stated that he was present when, in 1945, the first piloted' nying saucer' took off and reached a speed of 1,300 miles per hour within 3 minutes. The experimems resulted in three designs: one designed by Meithe, was a disk-shaped aircraft, 135 feet in diameter, which did not rotate; another, designed by Habermohl and Schriever, consisted of a large rotating ring, in the center of which was a round, stationary cabin gor the crew. When the Soviets occupied Prague. the Germans destroyed every trace of the 'nying saucer' project and nothing more was heard of Habennohl and his assistants. Schriever recently died in Bremen, where he had been living. In Breslau, the Soviets managed to capture one of the saucers built by Miethe, who escaped to France. He is reportedly in the US at prescnt. 4 This is the standard Nazi Legend of the UFO: the secret test facililies in Breslau and Prague, the names of Habermohl, Schriever, and Miethe, and the allegation of Soviet capture of at least one of these devices. Again, with Prague, one has the connection to the Kommlerstab. But with the mention of Breslau, one must pause once again to consider yet another curious \"operational anomaly\" of the end of World War Two, and that anomaly is the fanatical German defense of Breslau against the overwhelming Soviet forces besieging the city. Breslau, of course, was in Lower Silesia, then a province of , Nick Redfern, The F.B.I.

As such, it was the nearest large city to the environs where the Bell was tested. So, once again, behind the consistent Nazi UFO Legend and its insistence that something highly advanced was being worked on in or near Brcslau, one has in The Bell the probable basis of the legend. It should be noted, however, that at no time in the development of the history of the Bell does Polish researcher Igor Witkowski ever mention the names of Miethe, Habermohl, or Schriever in connection with it. Redfern also mentions the involvement of the United States Air Force in tracking down the Nazi Legend of the UFO: A report dated 3 January 1952 from Brigadier General W.M. Garland, USAF, to General Samford, Air Force DireclOr of Intelligence,', also addresses the issue of German involvement in the UFO mystery. Although somewhat speculative, relevant portions of lite report confirm Illal elements a/the USAF were a/the opinion that some UFOs were of earthly origin. ''The continued reports of unusual flying objects requires positive action to determine the nature and origin of this phenomena (sic) .... It is logical to relate the reported sightings to the known development of aircraft. jet propulsion, rockets and range extension capabilities in Germany and the USSR. In this connection, it is to be noted 'hat certain developments by the Germans, particularly the Horton wing, je, propulsion, and refueling, combined with their extensive employment of V-I and V-2 weapons during World War II, lend credence to the possibility that Ihejlying objects may be a/German and Russian origin. The developmems mentioned above were completed and operational between 1941 alld /944 alld sllbseqllemly fell ill to the hallds of the Soviets at the end of the war. There is evidence that the Germans H'ere working 011 these projects as far back as 1931 10 1938. Therefore it may be assumed thai the Germans had at least a 7 to J 0 year lead over the United States .... 6 Reading carefully between the lines, it is clear that as late as 1952, the director of United States Air Force Intelligence is entertaining the possibility not only that some UFOs are of Soviet origin, but of German origin as well. But in 1952, Germany was already divided, and in no economic shape to continue such black projects.

Note too that according to General Garland, such projects may have been begun in the early 1930s, with the terminus ante quem being fully two years before the Nazis took power. In any case, the period from 1931 to 1938 was when the various \"aether vortex theories\" were being developed in Germany by Hilgenberg and others, so it stands to reason that some experimental headway in technologies based upon those theories had already been made. However, Garland's remarks might indicate much more, if one places them in the wider context of the Bell, the Kammlerstab, and Igor Witkowski's own remarks to the effect that the Bell represented an \"off-the-books\" program, buried deep behind the v- I and V -2 and various other rocket and secret weapons projects of Nazi Germany. In effect, Garland is indicating that the possible real beginnings of a UFO-study and engineering group were in the years prior to World War Two, and in Germany. In this connection, I pointed out in my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, Reich of the Black Sun, that such a secret UFO study group clearly existed in Fascist Italy, having been established by Benito Mussolini in 1933 7 By the time of the end of the war, the SS had in effect become tbis \"study group,\" and it is no less significant that The Bell was its most sensitive project. Redfern then cites an FBI report that indicates that those on the \"inside\" were clearly aware that something was quite wrong with the Allied Legend of American nuclear bomb-engineering superiority over the Germans: .. . In addition (source) said tbat more recent reports have been received from representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency in Southern Europe and Southern Asia to the effect that the Russians were experimenting with some type of radical aircraft or guided missile which could be dispatched for great distances OUI over the sea, made to turn in flight and return to the base from which it was launched. He related that this information was extremely worthy of notice as experiments in this country have so far only developed to the point where we are concemed with delivering a missile to the required point 7 Joseph P.

(Source) also advised that it is a known fact that the Russians are attempting to develop some type of nuclear energy. that they received a wealth oj information concerning nuclear energy at the time of their occupation in Germany, and that they have at their disposal a limited supply of fissionable materials. (Source) pointed out that the Russians have some very capable scientists in the field of atomic energy and that, in addition thereto, they took into (heir custody some of the most-advanced and capable scientists of the German nation. 8 But why worry at all if the wartime German scientists were such nuclear bunglers? Unless, of course, one recalls that Baron Manfred Von Ardenne had hit upon the idea of using cyclotrons for enriching uranium. Then Redfern delivers some bombshells. The first is a report delivered to the FBI in the summer of 1947 - the year of the alleged Roswell crash and recovery, as well as of the alleged founding of MJ-12 - by one of its informants, a Mr. Edwin M. Bailey of Stamford, Connecticut. Bailey's comments were the subject of the following memorandum to the FBI's director, J. Edgar Hoover: Bailey stated that the topic of 'flying suaeers' had eaused eonsiderable comment and concern to the present day scientists and indicated that he himself had a personal theory concerning the 'flying saucers.\" Prior to advaneing his own theory, Bailey remarked that immediately after the eonclusion of World War 11, a friend of his (eensored), allegedly observed the \"flying saucers\" from an observatory in Milan and Bologna, Italy. He stated thaI apparently at that time the \"flying saueers\" had eaused a little eomment in Italy but that after some little publicity they immediately died out as publie interest. Bailey stated that it is quite possible that actually the \"flying saucers\" could be radio controlled germ bombs or atom bombs which are circling the orbit of the earth and whieh could be eontrolled by radio and directed to land on 8 Nick Redfern, The FBI Files. p. 200, emphasis added. 446"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell 1Ii.!!ll:~:>r \"\"r: 111',. _ ... - .. - Ib ...... _ t:=: .. - T:'- !lAY, '!1II:1I1N 'Oo\\TY ftC1~ ,.TI4 .....

[n November of 1957, however, the FBI received one of its most interesting reports in its Detroit office. Barring the FBI's censoring of the name of the witness in the report, the report itself is extremely significant, since it is the eyewitness testimony of a Polish prisoner-oF-war to the extraordinary technology he saw being tested by the Germans: (Witness was) born February 19, 1926, in the State of Warsaw, Poland, (and) was brought from Poland as a Prisoner of War to Gut Alt Golssen approximately 30 miles east of Berlin, Gennany, in May, 1942, where he remained until a few weeks after the end of World War II. He spent the following years at Displaeed Persons Camps at Kork, Strasburg, Offenburg, Milheim and Freiburg, Germany. He attended a radio technician school at Freiburg and for about a year was employed in a textile mill at Laurachbaden, Gennany. He arrived in the united States at New York, May 2, 1951, via the \"SS General Stewart\" as a Displaced Person ... According to (witness), during 1944, month not recalled, while enroute to work in a field a short distance north of Gut All Golssen, their tractor engine stalled on a road through a swamp area. No machinery or other vehicle was then visible although a noise was heard described as a high-pitched whinc similar to that produced by a large electric generator. An \"SS\" guard appeared and talked briefly with tbe Gennan driver of the traclOr, who waited five to ten minutes, after which the noise stopped and the tractor engine \\\\-'as started nonnally. Approximately 3 hours later in the same swamp area, but away from the road where the work crew was curting \"hay.\" he surreptitiously, because of the German in charge of the crew and \"SS\" guards in the otherwise deserted area, observed a circular enclosure approximately I00 to 150 yards in diameter protected from viewers by a tarpaulin-type wall approximately 50 feet high, from which a vehicle was observed to slowly rise vertically to a height sufficient to clear the wall and then to 448"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"The SS Brotherhood of the Bell ~=======:::c-----~_._--- - .1&1. \"Ion. hH If 1111' -. , . .l....r.~~ (.. ~ .' r r ?'I_ L \".Il FBI UFO Document : .:J . : 1.: ~:~ . . . ~. move slowly horizontally a shon distance out of his view. which was obstmcted by nearby trees.

Nor is a Polish prisoner of war likely to be eager to fabricate anytbing tbat would make the Nazis look good. According to Redfern, a similar account, dated June 8, 1967, also was found in the FBI's declassified UFO files. It reads as follows: On April 26, 1967, (source) appeared at the Miami Office and furnished the following infonnation relating to an object, presently referred to as an unidentified flying object, he allegedly photographed during November, 1944. Sometime during 1943, be graduated from the Gern\"n Air Academy and was assigned as a member of the Lufrwaffe on the Russian Front. Near the end of 1944. he was released from this duty and was assigned as a tcst pilot to a top secret project in the Black Forest of Austria. During rhis period he observed the aircraft described above. It was saucer shaped, about twenty-one feet in diameter, radio- controlled. and mounted several jet engines around the exterior portion of the craft. He further described the exterior portion as revolving around the dome in the center which remained stationary. It was (witness's) responsibility to photograph the object while in flight. He asserted he was able to retain a negative of a photograph he made at 7,000 meters (20,000 feet). According to (witness) the above aircraft was designed and engineered by a Gennan engineer whose present whereabouts IS unknown to him. (Witness) also assumed the secrets pertaining to this aircraft were captured by Allied Forces. He said this type of aircraft was responsible for the downing of at least one American B-26 airplane. 12 Clearly at least some in the US government's many intelligence agencies were interested in tbe possibility of Nazi origins for some of the observed UFOs that began invading American airspace after World War Two. These documents, unlike the Cooper-Cantwheel MAJlc-12 documents, are undeniably authentic, One does not have to place \" Nick Redfern, The FBI Files. pp. 203-204. 12 Nick Redfern, The FBI Files, pp. 205-207. 451"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":".. What is the Brotherhood of the Bell?\" them in a gray area between \"genuine\" and \"complete hoax\" to appreciate their significance. And this should give one pause, for they corroborate what those MAJIC-12 themselves seem to imply: that someone, somewhere, in the confusing tangle of US intelligence agencies, was keeping track of the Nazi angle on UFOs, and that they were perhaps worried about a continued independent covert development of the exotic technology they displayed. The documents that Redfern uncovers in fact corroborate the general scenarios outlined in our own examination and analysis of the Cooper-Cantwheel MAJlc-12 documents. 13 However one slices it, there is a clear documentary indication of Nazi association with the development of at least some of the technology associated with UFO technology. But more extraordinary is that one detects, at various levels, all the elements involved in Kennedy's assassination. And that may be significant in and of itself, an indicator, perhaps, that the \"Brotherhood's\" involvement in the murder was ultimately motivated by technological considerations, and financially backed by the world's largest - and well known corporations. This surely was not the only motivation for the assassination, but, in alliance with threatened \"big oil\" and banking interests, it was a powerful one. If Kennedy had been successful in smashing the CIA or in joint space cooperation with the Soviets, then this might have exposed a hidden secret space program and its secret technology. In this context, recall that one of the MAJIC-12 documents indicated that President Nixon privatized the alleged secret UFO study-and-action group. In this context, it is perhaps apparent, that there was not really any reason for him to do so. It had been independent since the end of the war. But ultimately, what was at stake, beyond this technology and the power it represented? One answer, perhaps, was allegedly given by Dr. Werner Von Braun himself to his fonner assistant at Fairchild Industries, Dr. Carol Rosin. Von Braun had retired - or perhaps had \"been 13 An interesting sideline on this is that Redfern also mentions the unusual Nazi connections of the famous 1950s \"contactee\" George Adamski.

Rosin describes Von Braun's \"dying message\" to her: When I was a Corporate Manager of Fairchild Industries from 1974 through 1977, I met the late Dr, Werner Von Braun, We first met in early 1974, At that time, Von Braun was dying of cancer but he assured me that he would live a few more years to tell me about the game that was being played - that game being the effort to weaponize space. to control the Earth from space and space itself, Von Braun had a history of working with weapons systems. He escaped from Germany14 to come to tbis country and became a Vice President of Fairchild Industries, when I had met him. Von Braun's purpose during the last years of his life, his dying years, was to educate the public and decision-makers about why space-based weapons are dumb, dangerous, destabilizing, too costly, unnecessary, unworkable, and an undesirable idea, and about the alternatives that are available. As practically a deathbed speech, he educated me about those concepts and who the players were in this game. He gave me the responsibility, since he was dying, of continuing this effort to prevent the weaponization of outer space. When Werner Von Braun was dying of cancer, he asked me to be his spokesperson, to appear on occasions when he was too ill to speak, I did this, What was most interesting to me was a repetitive sentence that he said to me over and over again during the approximately four years that I had the opportunity to work with him, He said ti,e strategy that was being used to educate the public and decision makers was to use- scare tactics. That was how we identify an enemy. The strategy that Werner Von Braun taught me was that first the Russians are going to be considered to be the enemy. [n fact, in 1974, they were the enemy, the identified enemy. We were told they had \"killer satellites\", We were told that they were coming to get liS and control us - that they were \"Commies.\" Then terrorists would be identitied, and that was soon to fo11O\\\\I. 'We heard a lot about terrorism. Then we were going to identify third-world country \"crazies.\" We now call them Nations of Concern. But he said that would be the third enemy against whom we would build space- based weapons. The next enemy was asteroids, Now, at that point he kind of chuckled the first time he said it. Asteroids - against asteroids \\ve are going to build space-based weapons. 14 It should be obvious by now that Von Braun did Dot \"escape\" Germany. having worked for Hitler right up to the capitulation, 453"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"J' What is the Brotherhood of the Bell?\" And the funniest one of all was what he called aliens, extraterrestrials. That would be the final scare. And over and over and over during the four years that 1 knew him and was giving speeches for him, he would bring up that last card. \"And remember, Carol, the last card is the alien card. We are going to have to build space-based weapons against aliens, and all of it is a lie. The last card that was being held was the extraterrestrial enemy card. The intensity with which he said that. made me realize that he knew something that he was too afraid to mention. He was too afraid to talk about it. He would not tell me the details. I am not sure I would have absorbed them if he had told me the details or even believed him in 1974. But there was no question tbat that man knew and had a need to know, J found out later. 15 Rosin makes clear subsequently in her statements that she personally believes in extraterrestrials in the standard sense, that she also makes clear her personal opposition to space-based weapons,16 and does all this in a matmer that suggests that Von Braun was implying that \"E.T.\" was merely being misunderstood by a trigger-happy American mililary. In other words, the \"lie\" Von Braun referred to was that \"ET\" was being covered up and misunderstood. But it is not at all obvious from Von Braun's alleged remarks to her that this is the only interpretation nor even the bes( one. After all, Von Braun had been part of the world's first space program and the first attempt to weaponize space, a program that outlined, long in advance of their realization, the steps necessary to place \"killer satellites\" in orbit: Nazi Germany's. And Von Braun's associate at Peenemiinde, Dr. Kurt Debus - a high voltage expert - was also involved with The Bell. Debus subsequently became a director at the Kennedy Space Flight Center in Florida during the Apollo project, a strange position for an expert in high voltage to be in during the world's first manner Lunar landing program. Von Braun's remarks might, therefore, be interpreted to mean a planned deception, brought about by technology - the \"ET Threat\" - to be 15 Steven M.
