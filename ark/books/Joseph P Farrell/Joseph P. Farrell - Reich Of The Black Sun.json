Histor ical oddities or anomalous news stories especially attracted my interest, lingering in my mind for years to come. Like many Americans, I well remember where I was when President Kennedy was assa ssinated. I was home, sick, and watching television, sipping an en dless stream of the chicken noodle soup that my mother always made for me when I was ill. My mother sat on the sofa, sewing and watching her shows. Then, the programs were interrupted by the familiar voice of Walter Cronkite, and the news began to break. Like many children in America, I cried that night. A year or so later when the Warren Report was published and excerpted in almost every newspa per in the country, I remember thinking \"bullets just don't do th at.\" And I listened intently as family members debated the offici al conclusions of Oswald, the \"lone nut\" in his Texas School Book Depository, versus what was beginning to emerge with the \"Grassy Knoll.\" As a teenager I became fascinat ed with the history of World War Two, and particularly the Eu ropean theater and the race for the atomic bomb. Physics was also an interest for me, and another oddity lodged in my mind as I read the standard histories: the United States had never tested the uranium bomb it dropped on Hiroshima. I thought that was an extremely odd oddity indeed. It seemed to have the same sharp angles and corners as the Warren Commission's \"magic bullet\". It just didn't fit. Other odd facts accumulated over the years as if to underline the strangeness of the war's end in general and that fact in particular. Then, in 1989, the Berlin Wall came down and the two post- war Germanies raced toward reunification. The events seemed to unfold faster than th e news media's abilit y to keep pace. I remember that day too, for I was driving with a friend in his van in Manhattan. My friend was Russia n, as was his family, some of "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"whom were veterans of the harsh c onflict on the Russian front. We listened to the reports on the radio with a kind og breathlessness and anxiety. My friend lurried to me and said \"Now it w ill start to come out in the wash.\" I nodded in ag reement. We had often discussed what would happen in the eventua lity of German reunification, and were agreed that many things from the end of the war would begin to surface, answering old questions and raising new ones. Our long talks about World War Two had convi nced us that there was much about the war that did not make sense, Hitler's and Stalin's genocidal paranoia notwithstanding. Gradually, and one must sa y, predictably, the Germans themselves raced to uncover what lay hidden in the formerly inaccessible archival vaults of East Germany and the Soviet Union. Witnesses came forward, and German authors endeavored to come to grips with yet anot her aspect of the darkest period in their nation's history. Much, if not all, of their work remains ignored in the U.S.A., both by mainstream and by alternative researchers. This present book is based in part on these Germans' efforts. It, like them, raises dangerous questi ons, and often presents dangerous and disturbing answers. As a consequence, while the Nazi regime's \"image\" becomes even more blacken ed, the image of the victorious Allies also suffers to a great degree. This book presents not only a radically different history of the race for the bomb, but also outlines a case that Germany was maki ng enormous strides toward acquisition of a whole host of second and third and even fourth generation weapons technologies even more horrific in their destructive power. That in itself would not be too unusual. After all, there have been a wealth of books on World War Two German secret weapons projects and their astonish ing results. Those seeking new technical data on these weapons wi ll find some new material here, for the thrust of the book is not on the weapons per se. Rather, the present work seeks a context within Nazi ideology and in some aspects of contemporary theoretica l physics for these projects. This book argues that the Nazis' quest for this barbarous arsenal of prototypical \"smart weapons\" a nd weapons of mass destruction was intimately linked to the Nazi ra cial and genocidal ideology and "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"war aims, to the machinery, bur eaucracy, and technol ogies of mass death and slavery that the Nazis had perfected. Even more darkly, this relationship points to a hidden core of occult beliefs and practices that, allied with certain very \"German\" advances in physics, e.g., quantum mechanics, drove their quest for ultimate weapons. Accordingly, this is not a work of history. But neither is it a work merely of fiction. It is best described as a case of possibilities, of speculative history. It is an atte mpt to make sense, by means of a radical hypothesis placed within a very broad context, of events during and after the war that make no sense. I would like to thank Mr. Frank Joseph of Fate magazine for encouraging me to write about th ese ideas, after he had patiently listened to me outline them wh ile we were both attending a conference in 2003. And I would like to thank the many people - too numerous to mention - who lis tened, read, an d critiqued the book along the way. Joseph P.

Lee Benns, Europe Since 1914 In Its World Setting 1 The end of the Second World Wa r in Europe, at least as normally recounted, does not make se nse, for in its standard form as learned in history books that history resembles nothing so much as a badly written finale to some melodramatic Wagnerian opera. On a night in October 1944, a Ge rman pilot and rocket expert by the same of Hans Zinsser was flying his Heinkel 111 twin engine bomber in twilight over northern Germany, close to the Baltic coast in the province of Mecklenburg. He was flying at twilight to avoid the Allied fighter aircraft that at that time had all but undisputed mastery of the skies over Germany. Little did he know that what he saw that night would be locked in the vaults of the highest classification of the United States government for several decades after the war. And he certainly could not have been aware of the fact when his testimony finally was declassified near the end of the millennium, that what he saw w ould require the history of the Second World War to be rewritte n, or at the very minimum, severely scrutinized. His observation s on that one night on that one flight resolve at a stroke some of the most pres sing questions and mysteries concerning the end of th e war. By the same token, what he saw raises many more mysterie s and questions, affording a brief and frightening glimpse into the labyrinthine world of Nazi secret weapons development. His observa tions open a veritable Pandora's 1 F. Lee Benns, Europe Since 1914 In Its World Setting (New York: F.S. Crofts and co., 1946), p. 630. 3"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"box of horrifying research the Third Reich was conducting, research far more horrendous in its scope and terrible promise than mere atomic bombs. More importantly, his observations also raise the disturbing question of why the Allied governments - America in particular - kept so much classified for so long. What, really, did we recover from the Nazis at the end of the war? But what precisely is that badly written finale? To appreciate how badly written a finale it truly is, it is best to begin at the logical pl ace: in Berlin, far belo w ground, in the last weeks of the war. There, in the bizarre and surreal world of the Fuhrerbunker, the megalomaniac German dictator huddles with his generals, impervious to the rain of Allied and Soviet bombs that are reducing the once beautiful city of Berlin to piles of rubble. Adolph Hitler, Chancellor and Fuhrer of the ever-diminishing Greater German Reich is in conference. Hi s left arm shakes uncontrollably and from time to time he must pause to daub the drool that occasionally oozes from his mouth. His complexion is gray and pallid; his health, a sh ambles from the drugs hi s doctors inject in him. His glasses are perched on hi s nose as he squints at the map before him. 2 Generaloberst 3 Heinrici, commander of the vastly outnumbered Army Group Vistula that faces the massed armies of Marshal Zhukov poised less than sixty miles from Berlin, is pleading with his leader for more troops. The general is questioning the disposition of the forces he sees displayed on the battle map, for it is clear to him that some of Germany's finest and few remaining battle worthy formations are far south, facing Mars hal Koniev's forces in Silesia. These forces were thus, incomprehensibly, poised to make a stiff defense of Breslau and Prague, no t Berlin. The general pleads for Hitler to release some of these forces and tr ansfer them north, but 2 Contributing yet another nuance to th e end of the war Legend of Hitler's delusional insanity, some have proposed that the German dictator's doctors had diagnosed him with heart disease and/or Parkinson's disease, and were keeping him drugged at the behest of Msrs Borm ann, Gobbels, Himmler et al. in a desperate attempt to keep him functioning. 3 Generaloberst: i.e., Colonel Gc n e r a l , the equivalent of a four star American general. 4"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"to no avail. \"Prague,\" the Fuhrer responds st ubbornly, almost mystically, \"is the key to winning the war.\" Genera loberts Heinrici's hard-pressed troops must \"do without.\" 4 One may also perhaps imagine Heinrici and the other assembled generals perhaps casting a doleful glance at Norway on the situation map, where thousands of German troops are still stationed, occupying a country that had l ong since ceased to be of any strategic or operational value to the defense of the Reich. Why indeed did Hitler maintain so many German troops in Norway up to the very end of the war? 5 These paradoxical German troo ps deployments are the first mystery of the badly written finale of the war in Europe. Both Allied and German generals would ponder it after the war, and both would write it off to Hitler's in sanity, a conclusion that would become part of the \"Allied Legend\" of the end of the war. This interpretation does make sense, for if one assumed that Hitler were having a rare seizure of sanity wh en he ordered these deployments, what possibly could he have b een thinking? Prague? Norway? There were no standard or conven tional military reasons for the deployments. In other words, the deployments themselves attest his complete lack of touch with military reality. He therefore had to have been quite insane. But apparently his \"delusional in sanity\" did not stop there. On more than one occasion during th ese end-of-the-war conferences with his generals in the Fuhrerbunker, he boasted that Germany would soon be in the possession of weapons that would snatch victory from the jaws of defeat at \"five minutes past midnight.\" All 4 They did in fact \"do without\" and yet managed to put up a fierce resistance against overwhelming odds in the initial stages of Zhukov's final offensive on Berlin. 5 The standard versions, of course, are that he wished to maintain the supply line of iron ore from Sweden to Germany, and that he wished to continue to use the country as a base to interdict the lend-lease supply route to Russia. But by late 1944, with the huge losses of the German Kriegsmarine, these explanations no longer were milit arily feasible, and hence do not make military sense. One must look for other reasons, if indeed there are any beyond Adolph Hitler's delusions. 5"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"t h e Wehrmacht had to do was hold out a bit longer. And above all, it must hold Prague and lower Silesia. Of course, the standard historic al interpretati on of these and similar utterances by the Nazi lead ership near the end of the war explains them - or rather, explai ns them away - by one of two standard techniques. One school unde rstands them to refer to the more advanced versions of the V-l and V-2, and on rare occasions, the intercontinental A9/10 rockets, the jet fighters, anti-aircraft heat-seeking missiles, and so on th at the Germans were developing. Sir Roy Fedden, one of the British Specialists sent to Germany to investigate Nazi secret weapons re search after the war, left no doubt as to the deadly potential these developments held: In these respects (the Nazis) were not entirely lying. In the course of two recent visits to Germany, as le ader of a technical mission of the Ministry of Aircraft Production, I have seen enough of their designs and production plans to realize that if they had managed to prolong the war some months longer, we would have been confronted with a set of entirely new and deadly developments in air warfare. 6 The other standard schoo l of interpretation ex plains such remarks of the Nazi leadership as the u tterances of madmen desperate to prolong the war, and hence their lives, by stiffening the resistance of their exhausted armies. For example, to make the insanity gripping the Reich government complete, Hitler's ever-faithful toady and propaganda minister, Dr. Josef G obbels also boaste d in a speech near the end of the war that he had seen \"weapons so frightening it would make your heart stand still.\" More delusional ravings of a Nazi madman. But on the Allied side of the Allied Legend, things are equally peculiar. In March and April of 1945, US General George S. Patton's Third Army is literally ra cing across southern Bavaria, as fast as is operationally possible, making a beeline for: (1) the huge Skoda munitions works at Pilsen, a complex all but 6 Sir Roy Fedden, The Nazis' V-Wcapons Matured Too Late (London: 1945), cited in Renato Vesco and David Hatcher Childress, Man-Made UFOs: 1944-1994, p. 98."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"blown off the map by Allied bombers; (2) Prague; and (3) A region of the Harz Mountai ns in Thuringia known to Germans as the Dreiecks or Three Corners,\" a region encompassed by the old mediaev al towns and villages of Arnstadt, Jonastal, W echmar, and Ohrdruf. 7 One is informed by countless history books that this maneuver was thought to be nece ssary by the Supreme Hea dquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHEAF) because of reports that the Nazis were planning to make a last stand in the \"Alpine National Redoubt\", a network of fortified mountains stretching from the Alps to the Harz Mountains. The Third Army's movements, so the story goes, were designed to cut off the \"escape route\" of Nazis fleeing the carnage of Berlin. Ma ps are produced in old history books, accompanied in some cases by de-classified German plans - some dating from the Weimar Republic! - for just such a redoubt. Case settled. However, there is a problem with that explanation. Allied aerial reconnaissance would likely have told Eisenhower and SHAEF that there were precious few fortified strong points in the \"National Redoubt\". Indeed, it would have to ld them that the \"Redoubt\" was no redoubt at all. General Patton and his division al commanders would most certainly have been pr ivy to at least some of this information. So why the extraordinary and almost reckless speed of his advance, an advance the post-war Allied Legend would have us believe was to cut off the escape route of Nazis fleeing Berlin, who it turns out weren't fleeing, to a redoubt that didn't exist? The mystery deepens. Then, remarkably, in a strange twist of fate, General Patton himself, America's most celebrat ed general, dies suddenly, and, some would say, suspiciously, as a result of complications from injuries he sustained in a freak automobile accident soon after the end of the war and the beginning of the Allied military occupation. For many, there is little doubt that Patton's death is suspicious. But 7 Arnstadt is where the great German composer and organist J.S. Bach first began his career. 7"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"what of the explanations offered for it by those who do not think it was accidental? Some propose he was eliminated because of his remarks about turning the Germans \"right back around\" and letting them lead an Allied invasion of Russia. Others believe he was eliminated because he knew abou t the Allies' knowledge of the Soviets' execution of British, Am erican, and French prisoners of war, and threatened to make it p ublic. In any case , while Patton's barbed tongue and o ccasional outbursts are well known, his sense of military duty and obligation were far too high for him to have entertained such notions. These theo ries play out best, perhaps, on the internet or in the movies. And neither seems a sufficient motivation for the murder of America's most celebrated general. But then, if he was murdered, what was sufficient motivation? Here too, the lone German pilot Hans Zinsser and his observations afford a speculative key as to the possibilities, if General Patton was murdered, of why he had to be silenced. Let us return, for a moment, to a less-w ell publicized explanation for his end-of-the war lightening-like st rikes into south central Germany and into Bohemia: In Top Secret, Ralph Ingersoll, an American liaison officer at S.H.A.E.F., gives a version of the facts much more in line with German intentions: \"(General Omar) Bradley was complete master of the situation.... in full command of the three armies that had broken through the Rhine defenses and were free to exploit their victories. Analyzing the whole situation, Bradley felt that to take battered Berlin would be an empty military victory.... The German War Department had long since moved out, leaving only a rear echelon. The main body of the German War Department, including its priceless archives, had been transferred to the Thuringian Forest...\" 8 But what exactly did Patton's divisi ons discover in Pilsen and the forests of Thuringia? Only with the recent German reunification and declassification of East Germa n, British, and American documents are enough clues available to allo w this fantastic story - and the reason for the post-war Allied Le gend - to be outlined and its questions answered. 8 Vesco and Childress, op. cit., p. 97. 8"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Thus, finally, one arrives at the main theme of the post-war Allied Legend. As the A llied forces penetrated ever deeper into the German fatherland i t s e l f , teams of scientists and experts and their intelligence coordinators were sent in literally to scour the Reich for German patents, secret weapons research, and above all, to find out about the state of the Germ an atomic bomb project. 9 Literally vacuuming the Reich of ever y conceivable technological development, this effort became the largest technology transfer in history. Even at this late stage of the war, as Allied armies advanced across wester n Europe, there was fear on the Allied side that the Germans were perilously close to the A-bomb, and might actually use one on London or othe r Allied targets. And Dr. Gobbels and his speeches about fearsome heart-stopping weaponry were doing nothing to alleviate their fears. It is here that the mystery of the Allied Legend only deepens. It is here that the badly written fina le would be truly comical, were it not for the vast scale of human su ffering involved with it, for the facts are clear enough if one examines them independently of the explanations we have become accustomed to apply to them. Indeed, one must wonder if we were not conditioned to think about them in a certain way, for as the Allied armies advanced deeper and deeper into the Reich, famous German scientists and engineers were either captured, or they surrendered them selves. Among them were first class physicists, many of them Nobe l laureates. And most of them were involved, at some level, with the various atomic bomb projects of Nazi Germany. Among these scientists were We rner Heisenberg , one of the founders of quantum mechanics, Ku rt Diebner, a nuclear physicist, Paul Hartek, a nuclear chemist, Otto Hahn himself, the chemist who actually discovered nuclear fission, and curiously, Walter Gerlach, whose specialty was not nuclear, but gravitational physics. Gerlach had written esoteric papers be fore the war on such abstruse concepts as spin pola rization and vorticular physics, hardly the 9 \"Alsos\" was the code name of this effort. \"Alsos\" is a Greek word meaning \"Grove\", an obvious pun on General Leslie Groves, chief of the Manhattan Project. It is the name of the book about the Manhattan Project by Dutch-Jewish physicist Samuel Goudsmit. 9"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"basics of nuclear physics , and certainly not the sort of scientist one would expect to encounter working on atom bombs. 10 Much to the Allies' puzzlement, their scientific teams found but crude attempts by Heisenberg to construct a functioning atomic reactor, attempts that were wholly unsatisfactory and unsuccessful, and almost unbelievably inept. This \"German ineptitude\" in basic bomb physics became, and remains, a central component of the Allied Legend. And yet, that itself ra ises yet another mystery of the badly written finale. Top German scientists - Werner Heisenberg, Paul Hartek, Kurt Diebner, Erich Bagge, Otto Hahn, Carl Friedrich von Weizsacker, Karl Wirtz, Horst Kors ching, and Walter Gerlach - were carted off to Farm Hall, England, where they were kept in isolation, and their conversations recorded. The transc ripts, the celebrated \"Farm Hall Transcripts\", were only declassified by the British government in 1992! If the Germans were so far behind and so incompetent, why keep them classified for so long?\" Bureaucratic oversight and inertia? Or did they co ntain things the Allies did not wish to be known even at that late date? What a surface reading of the tr anscripts reveals only deepens the mystery considerably. In them, Heisenberg and company, after hearing of the a-bombing of Hi roshima by the Americans on the BBC, debate the endless moral issu es of their own involvement in the atomic bomb projects of Nazi Germany. But that is not all. In the transcripts, Heisenberg and company, who had suffered 10 Nick Cook, The Hunt for Zero Point, p. 194. Cook notes that these areas have little to do with nuclear physics, much less A-bomb design, but \"much to do with the enigmatic properties of gravity. A student of Gerlach's at Munich, O.C. Hilgenberg, published a paper in 1931 entitled 'About Gravitation, Vortices and Waves in Rota ting Media'.... And yet, af ter the war, Gerlach, who died in 1979, apparently never returned to these matters, nor did he make any references to them; almost as if he had been forbidden to do so. That, or something he had seen...had scared him beyond all reason.\" 11 It was Manhattan project chief General Leslie Groves who, in fact, revealed in his 1962 book about the bomb, Now It Can Be Told, that the German scientists' conversations had been recorded by the British. Apparently, however, not everything could be told in 1962. 10"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"some inexplicable mathematical and scientific dyslexia during the whole six years' course of the war, the same Heisenberg and company who could not even design and build a successful atomic reactor to produce plutonium for a bomb, suddenly become Nobel laureates and first rank physicists after the war. Indeed, Heisenberg himself within a matter of a few da ys of Hiroshima, gave a lecture to the assembled German scientists on the basic design of the bomb. In it, he defends his first assess ment that the bom b would be about the size of a pineapple, and no t the one or two ton monster he maintained throughout most of the war. And as we shall discover in the transcripts nuclear chemist Paul Hartek is close - perilously close - to the correct critical mass of uranium for the Hiroshima bomb. 12 This demonstrable mathematical prowess raises yet another question directly confronting the Allied Legend, for some versions of that Legend would have it that the Germans never aggressively pursued bomb development because they had - via Heisenberg - overestimated the critical mass by several order of magnitude, thus rendering such a project impracti cal. Hartek had clearly done the calculations before, so Heisenberg's estimates were certainly not the only calculations the Germans ha d available to th em. And with a small critical mass comes the prac tical feasibility of an atomic bomb. In his August 14, 1945 \"lecture\" to the assembled German Farm Hall physicists, Heisenberg , according to Paul Lawrence 12 Q.v. Paul Lawrence Rose, Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb project: A Study in German Culture (Berkeley: 1998), pp. 217-221.

Samuel Goudsmit, of course, used the transcripts to construct his version of the Allied Legend: \"That the German scientists were at odds with one another, that they didn't understand bomb physics, and that they concocted a false story of moral scruples to explain their scientific failures.... The sources of Goudsmit's conclusions are all obvious in the transcripts, but what leaps out at the reader now are the many statements which Goudsmit failed to notice, forgot, or deliberately overlooked.\" (Ibid., p. 436) 11"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Rose, used a tone and phrasing that indicated that \"he has only just now understood the solution\" to a small critical mass for the bomb, 13 since \"others\" reported a critical mass of about 4 kg. This too only deepens the mystery.

Th at explanation, in conjunction with Heisenberg's own sell-evidently clumsy at tempts to construct a functioning reactor, served well enough until these transcripts were declassified. With the appearance of the transcripts and their stunning revelations of Heisenberg's actual knowledge of atomic bomb design, and some of the other scient ists' clear unders tanding of the means to enrich enough weapons grade uranium without having to have a functioning reactor, the Legend had to be \"touched up\" a bit.

And almo st as soon as it appeared, Lawrence Rose countered with He isenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project, arguing even more persuasively that Heisenberg had remained a loyal German and had not sabotaged anything, but that he simply labored under massive misconceptions of the nature of nuclear fission, and consequently over-calculated the critical mass needed to make a bomb during the war. The Germans never obtained the bomb, so the new version goes, because they never had a functioning reactor by which to enrich uranium to plutonium to make a bomb. Besides, having grossly overestimated the critical mass, they had no real impetus to pursue it. Simple enough, case closed once again. But again, neither Powers' nor Ro se's books really go to the heart of the mystery, fo r the Legend still requ ires the belief that \"brilliant nuclear physicists including Nobel prize winners before the war, apparently struck by some strange malady which turned them into incompetent bunglers during the...War,\" 15 were suddenly and quite inexplicably cured of the malady within a few days of the bombing of Hiroshima!

Matters are not helped by events on the other side of the world in the Pacific theater, for there American investigators would uncover similarly strange goings on after the war ended. There, after Nagasaki, the Em peror Hirohito, overriding his ministers who wanted to continue the war, decided that Japan would surrender unconditionall y. But why would Hirohito's ministers urge continuance of th e war in the face of overwhelming Allied conventional arms superiorit y, and, from their point of view, facing a potential rain of atomic bombs? After all, \"two\" bombs could just as easily have turned into twenty. One could, of course, attribute the ministers' objections to the Emperor' s intentions to \"proud samurai tradition s\" and the Japanese sense of \"honor\" and so on. And that would indeed be a plausible explanation. But another explanation is that Hirohito's cabinet ministers knew something. What his ministers probabl y knew was what American intelligence would soon discover: that the Japanese, \"just prior to their surrender, had developed and successfully test fired an atomic bomb. The project had been housed in or near Konan(Japanese name for Hungnam), Korea, in the peninsula's North.\" 16 It was exploded, so the story goes, one da y after the American plutonium bomb, \"Fat Man\", exploded over Nagasaki, i.e., on August 10, 1945. The war, in other words, de pending on Hirohito's decision, could have \"gone nuclear\". By that time, of course it would have done Japan no good to prolong it, with no viable means of delivery of an atomic weapon to any worthwhile strategic American targets.

Why, for example, in 1944, did a lone Junkers 390 bomber, a massive six engine heavy-lift ul tra long-range tran sport aircraft capable of round trip in tercontinental flight from Europe to North America, fly to within less than twenty miles of New York City, photograph the skyline of Manhattan, and return to Europe? 18 Germany launched several such to p secret long-distance flights during the war, using these and other heavy- lift ultra-long range aircraft. But what was their pur pose, and more importantly, the purpose of this unique flight? 19 That such a fli ght was extremely risky goes without saying. What we re the Germans up to with this enormous aircraft, and why would they even risk such an operation just to take pictures, when they only ever had two of these enormous six engine monsters available? Finally, and to round out the Le gend, there are the odd details of the German surrender and the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunals. Why does former Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler, mass murderer and one of human history' s most notorious criminals, try to negotiate a surrender to the We stern Allies? Of course, one can dismiss this as delusi on, and Himmler was cert ainly delusional. But what could he possibly have thought he had to offer the Allies in return for a surrender to the West, and the sparing of his own wretched life?

It did, and magnificently. But what is immensely significant - a fact missi ng from almost all mainstream literature on the subject since the end of the war - is that the uranium bomb with its apparatus of a cannon shooting the critical mass of uranium together, the bomb that was actually first used in war, the bomb dropped on Hiro shima, was never tested. As German author Friedrich Georg notes, this tears a rather gaping hole in the A llied Legend: Also another question is of great importance: Why was the uranium bomb of the USA, unlike the plutonium bomb, not tested prior to being hurled on Japan? Militarily this would appear to be extremely dangerous.... Did the Americans simply forget to test it, or did others already do it for them? 23 The Allied Legend accounts for this in various ways, some ingenious, some not so ingenious, but basically they boil down to the assertion that it was never tested because it did not need to be, so confident were Allied engineers that it would work. So we have been asked to believe, by the post-war Allied spin, that the American military dropped an atomic bomb of untested design, based on concepts of phy sics that were very new and themselves very untested, on an enemy city, an enemy also known to be working on acquiring the atomic bomb as well!

Something that, had he known it, would require the previous ba dly written Wagneri an libretto to be almost completely revised. His affidavit is contained in a military intelligence report of August 19, 1945, roll number A1007 , filmed in 1973 at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. Zinsse r's statement is found on the last page of the report: 47. A man named ZINSSER, a Flak rocket expert, mentioned what he noticed one day: In the beginning of Oct, 1944 I flew from Ludwigslust (south of Lubeck), about 12 to 15 km from an atomic bomb test station, when I noticed a strong, bright illumination of the whole atmosphere, lasting about 2 seconds. 48. The clearly visible pressure wa ve escaped the approaching and following cloud formed by the explosion. This wave had a diameter of about 1 km when it became visible and the color of the cloud changed frequently. It became dotted after a short period of darkness with all sorts of light spots, which were, in contrast to normal explosions, of a pale blue color. 49. After about 10 seconds the sharp outlines of the explosion cloud disappeared, then the cloud began to take on a lighter color against the sky covered with a gray overcast. The diameter of the still visible pressure wave was at least 9000 meters while remaining visible for at least 15 seconds. 50. Personal observations of the colors of the explosion cloud found an almost blue-violet shade. During this manifestation reddish- colored rims were to be seen, cha nging to a dirty-like shade in very rapid succession. 51. The combustion was lightly felt from my observation plane in the form of pulling and pushing. 52. About one hour later I started with an He 111 from the A/D 24 at Ludwigslust and flew in an easterly direction. Shortly after the start I passed through the almost complete overcast (between 3000 and 4000 meter altitude).

Note: It does not seem very clear to me why these experiments took place in such crowded areas. 25 In other words, a German pilot had observed the te st of a weapon, having all the signatures of a nuc lear bomb: electromagnetic pulse and resulting malfunction of his radio, mushroom cloud, continuing fire and combustion of nuclear material in the cloud and so on. And all this on territory clearly under German control, in October of 1944, fully eight months before the first American A-bomb test in New Mexico! Note the curious fact that Zinsser maintains that the test took place in a populated area. There is yet another curiosity to be observed in Zinsser's statement, one that his American interrogators either did not pursue, or, if they did pursue it, th e results remain classified still: How did Zinsser know it was a test? The answer is obvious: Zinsser knew, because he was somehow in volved, for clearly the Allies would not have control over a test site deep in Nazi Germany. Earlier in the same report, th ere are clues that unravel the mystery: 14. When Germany was at this stage of the game, the war broke out in Europe. At first investigations on this disintegrating of 235 U (sic) were somewhat neglected because a practical application seemed too far off. Later, however, this research continued, especially in finding methods of separating isotopes. Needless to say that the center of gravity of Germany's war effort at that time lay in other tasks. 25 The entire documentation of this report is as follows : \"Investigations, Research, Developments and Practical Use of the German Atomic Bomb,\" A.P.I.U. (Ninth Air Force) 96/1945 APO 696, U S Army, 19 August 1945.\" The report is classified secret. Note that the report begins in no uncertain terms: \"the following information was ob tained from four German scientists: a chemist, two physical chemists, and a rocket specialist. All four men contributed a short story as to what they knew of the atomic bomb development.\" (Emphasis added). Note also the suggestive title of the report. 19"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"15. Nevertheless the atomic bomb was expected to be ready toward the end of 1944, if it had not been for the effective air attacks on laboratories engaged in this uranium research, especially on the one in Ryukon in Norway, where heavy water was produced. It is mainly for this reason that Germany did not succeed in using the atomic bomb in this war. These two paragraphs are quite revealing for several reasons. First, what is the source for the assertion that the Germans expected the bomb to be ready in late 1944, well ahead of the Manhattan Project, and a statement in flat contradiction to the post- war Allied spin that the Germans were actually far behind? Indeed, during the war, Manhattan Project es timates consistently placed the Germans ahead of the Allies, a nd project chief General Leslie Groves also thought they were. But after the war, everything suddenly changed. Not only was Am erica ahead, but according to the Legend, it had been consisten tly far ahead throughout the war. Manhattan Project Chief General Leslie Groves Zinsser's account raises a disturbing possibility - besides completely contradicting the Allie d Legend - and th at is, did the Allies learn of a German A-bomb test du ring the war?

The intelligence report talks, for example, only of laboratories be ing the facilities conducting isotope enrichment and separation resear ch. But mere laboratories would simply be incapable of development of an actual functioning atom bomb. So one component of the Legend emerges in this early report: the German effort was l ackadaisical, being confined to laboratories. Secondly, note the clear assertion that Germany did not succeed in \"using the atomic bo mb in this war.\" The language of the report is very clear. Yet it would also appear to be designed to obfuscate in aid of the then emerging Alli ed Legend, for the statement does not say that the Germans never test ed a bomb, only that they did not use one. The language of the re port is oddly careful, deliberate, and for that reason, all the more thought provoking. Thirdly, note how much is actuall y - and inadvertently it would seem - revealed about German atomic bomb research and development, for the statements make it clear that the Germans were after a uranium based A-bo mb. A plutonium bomb is never mentioned. The theory of pl utonium develo pment and the possibility of a plutonium based A-bomb were clearly known to the Germans, as a Top Secret memorandum to the Heereswaffenamt (Army Ordnance Bureau) in ear ly 1942 makes abundantly clear. 26 So it is the absence of plutonium from this report that affords us a first significant clue into wh at was probably th e real nature of 26 This memorandum obviously constitute s another sore spot for the Allied Legend that emerged after the war, namely, that the Germans never knew the correct amount of the critical mass of a uranium fission bomb, but that it had been grossly overestimated by several orders of magnitude, hence rendering the project \"unfeasible\" within the span of the war. The problem of the HWA memorandum is that the Germans had a good ball-park estimate as early as January-February of 1942. And if they knew it was so small, then the resulting \"decision\" of the German High Command as to the impracticality of its development becomes immensely problema tical. On the contrary, because of this memorandum - most likely prepared by Dr. Kurt Diebner or Dr. Fritz Houtermans - they knew that the und ertaking was not only practical but feasible within the span of the war. 22"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"German atom bomb res earch. It is this absence that explains why the Germans never placed mu ch emphasis on achieving a functioning reactor in order to enrich uranium to make weapons grade plutonium for an atom bomb: they did not need to do so, since there were other methods of enriching and separating enough U 235 to weapons grade purity and a stockpile of critical mass. In a nutshell: the Allied Lege nd about the German failure to obtain the atom bomb because they never had a functioning reactor is simply utter scientific nonsense , because a reactor is needed only it one wants to produce pluton ium. It is an unneeded, and expensive, development, if one only wants to make a uranium A- bomb. Thus, there is sufficient re ason, due to the science of bomb- making and the political and military realities of the war after America's entry, that the Germans took the decision to develop only a uranium bomb, sin ce that afforded the best, most direct, and technologically least complicated route to acquisition of a bomb. Let us pause a moment to put the indications of the German project in the context of the Manh attan Project taking place in the United States. There, with a production capacity larger than Germany's, and with an industrial base not being targeted by enemy bombing, the American project decided to concentrate on development of all available mean s to production of working atom bombs, i.e., uranium and plutoni um bombs. But the production of plutonium could only be achieved in the construction of a functioning reactor. No r eactor, no plutonium bomb. But it should also be noted that the Manhattan Project also constructed the giant Oak Ridge f acility in Tennessee to enrich uranium to weapons grade by ga seous diffusion and Lawrence's mass spectrometer processes, a f acility that at no stage of its operation relied upon a functioning reactor in order to enrich uranium. So, if the Germans were pursuin g a similar approach to that employed at Oak Ridge, then we must find indicators to corroborate it. First, to enrich uranium by the same or similar methods as employed in Tennessee , the Reich would have had to build a similarly huge facility, or smaller facilities scattered throughout Germany, transporting th e various levels of dangerous 23"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"uranium isotope from one point to another as feedstock until the desired level of purity and enrichment was achieved. The material would then have to be assemble d in a bomb, and tested. So one must first look for a facilities or facilities. And given the Oak Ridge operation and its massive size, we know exactly what to look for: enormous size, close proximity to water, an adequate transportation infrastructure, enormous electrical power consumption, and finally, two other significant factors: an enormous labor pool, and enormous cost. Secondly, in order to verify or corroborate Zinsser's astonishing affidavit, we must look for corr oborating evidence . We must look for indications that the German s had stockpiled enough weapons grade uranium to constitute a criti cal mass for an atom bomb. And then we must hunt for the test s ite or sites and se e if it(or they) bear(s) the signature(s) of an atomic blast. Fortunately, the information is now slowly coming available with the recent declassification of documents by Great Britain, the United States, the former Soviet Union, and as the archives of the former East Germany are being opened by the German government itself.

For Farben, the choice of Auschw itz as the site for the Buna plant was logical, and made fo r \"sound business reasons.\" The concentration camp nearby the s ite selected for the enormous facility guaranteed an endless supply of slave labor for its construction, and, conveniently, when the slaves had exhausted themselves in its secret construc tion and operation, they could be permanently \"laid off\". Farben dir ector Carl Krauch assigned one of its top Buna synthetic rubber expe rts, Otto Ambros, to investigate the sites for the proposed plant and make a recommendation. The site eventually selected - Auschwitz - was \"particularly suited for t h e installation\" over a competing site in Norway for one very important reason. A coal mine was nearby and three rivers converged to provide a vital requirement, a large source of water. Together with these three rivers, the Reich railroad and autobahn afforded excellent transportation to and from the area. These were not decisive advantages, however, over the Norwegian site. But the Silesian location had one advantage that was overwhelming: the S.S. had plans to expand enormously a concentration camp nearby. The promise of an inexhaustible supply of slave labor was an attraction that could not be resisted. 4 The selection having be en approved by the Fa rben board, Krauch then wrote a top secret letter to Ambros: In the new arrangement of priority stages ordered by Field Marshal Keitel, your building project has first priority....

Farben plant, its huge electrical consumption, and the directors' claims that it produced no Buna at all, Landry responded: \"That was not a rubber plant - you can bet your bottom dollar on that.\" Landry simply does not believe the primary purpose of the \"Buna plant\" was the production of rubber at all. 11 How then to account for the e normous electrical consumption and post-war insistence of Farben directors that the plant never produced any synthetic rubber at a ll? What other technology would require such enormous electrical power consump tion, such an enormous technical a nd unskilled labor staff, and such close proximity to plentiful water supplies? At that time, there was only one other technological process that could c onceivably require all these things. Hydrick puts the case this way: Certainly there is something wrong w ith this picture. A compilation of the three central and readily known facts just outlined - electrical consumption, construction costs, and I.G. Farben's previous record - does not readily form a picture that a Buna processing plant was the type of project being constructed at Auschwitz. Such a compilation does sketch a picture, however, of another important wartime production process, though secret at the time. The process is uranium enrichment. 12 So why call it a Buna plant? And why protest so vociferously to the Allied prosecutors that the plant never produced any Buna at all? One answer is that with so much labor being provided by the slave labor from the SS concentration ca mp nearby, the plant fell under SS security jurisdiction, and an effective \"cover\" would therefore been at the head of the list of Fa rben's and the SS' concerns.

The \"Buna plant\" became the cover story to explain the cons truction to the laborers - in the event that explanations were offered at all! - and to the Farben company contract employees who were \"out of the loop.\" In this respect, the delays in it s construction and the difficulties Farben encountered are also be st explained by its being a huge isotope separation facility, not un like those the Manhattan Project encountered when constructing its own similarly sized plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Like its Ameri can counterpart, shortages and delays and technical difficulti es dogged the project from its inception, and like its American counterpart, these delays were experienced in spite of its enjoying a similarly privileged position in the hierarchy of Nazi priorities as Oak Ridge. 14 So the strange assertions and be havior of the Fa rben directors on trial after the war begins to make sense. Faced already with an emerging \"Allied Legend\" about German incompetence in nuclear matters, the Farben directors and managers were perhaps trying in a subtle way to \"set the record st raight\" in the only way that would not overtly challenge th at Legend. They were attempting, perhaps, to provide a clue as to the real nature and achievements of the German bomb program that would only be noticed over time and with careful scrutiny. The selection of the site - near the concentration camp at Auschwitz and its hundreds of thous ands of hapless victims - also makes strategic, if not gruesome, sense. Much like dictators of more recent times, it would appear that the Nazi regime had placed the facility near the camp in a deliberate attempt to use \"human shields\" to protect the facility from Allied bombing.

The Isotope Separation Facil ity at Oak Ridge, Tennessee To establish that the \"Buna plant\" was most likely an isotope separation facility, however, requires that one prove the Germans possessed the technological me ans for isotope separation. Additionally, if such technology wa s employed at the \"Buna plant\", then it implies that there was more than one atom bomb project in Germany, for the \"Heisenberg\" wi ng of the project, and all the subsequent debates that surround it, are well known. So in addition to ascertaining whethe r or not Germany posse ssed the technology to separate isotopes, one must also attempt a broad reconstruction of the actual outlines and relationships of the various German atom bomb projects. By stating the problem in this fashion, one is again confronted by the post-war Allied Legend: In the traditional history of the bomb, (Manhattan project chief General Leslie) Groves has positione d the German plutonium effort as the only nuclear initiative Germany ever pursued. And he has magnified this misinformation, couched in a cushion of half-truths, to immense proportions - large enough to hide what appears to be a huge 32"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"German uranium enrichment project behind it - and thus he has shielded the Nazi near-success from the view of the world. 15 Did Germany have isotope enrichment technology available? And could it have employed that technology in su fficient quantity to make significant amounts of enriched uranium available for a bomb program? There can be no doubt that Germ any certainly had a sufficient supply of uranium ore, for the region of the Sudetenland - annexed by Germany after the infamous M unich conference in 1938 - is a region known for its rich deposits of some of the highest grade uranium ore in the world. The regio n, coincidentally, lies close to the \"Three Corners\" region of Th uringia in south central Germany, and therefore close to Silesia and the various installations that will be examined in parts two and thre e. So the Farben directors may have had another reason for choosi ng Auschwitz as the site for an enrichment facility. Auschwitz was close not only to water, an adequate transportation networ k, and abundant la bor, it was conveniently close to the uraniu m fields of the German-Czech Sudentenland. These facts raise a speculative possi bility. It is well-known that the announcement by nuclear chemis t Otto Hahn of his discovery of nuclear fission did not occur until after the Munich conference and the surrender of the Sudetenland to the Third Reich by Chamberlain and Daladier. But might the reality have been something different? Might, in fact, the discovery of fission taken pl ace before the conference, and its results wit hheld by the Reich until after Europe's only uranium supply was firmly in Nazi hands? It is perhaps significant that Adolf Hitler was prepared to go to war over the matter. In any case, before we investigate the question of the technology available to the Germans, we must first answer the question of why they apparently c oncentrated almost exclusively on 15 Hydrick, op. cit., p. 3. Obviously, Hydrick himself does not appear ready to go all the way and acknowledge that the Germans actually successfully tested an atom bomb before its American Manhattan project counterpart produced and tested one. 33"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"obtaining a uranium atom bomb in their prog ram. After all, the American Manhattan Project had elected to pursue both a uranium and a plutonium bomb. Th e theoretical possib ility of plutonium bombs - \"element 94\" as it was officially called in German documents of the period - was cert ainly known to the Nazis. And, as the early 1942 memorandum to th e Heereswaffenamt also makes clear, the Germans also knew th at this element could only be synthesized in an atomic reactor. So why did they apparently concentrate only on a uranium bomb and isotope separation and en richment almost exclusively? With the destruction of the Norwegian heavy water plant at Ryukon in 1942 by Allied commandos, and German failures in obtaining sufficient purity of gra phite for use as a moderator in a reactor, the only other moderator available to them - heavy water - was now in critically short supply. Thus, accord ing to the Legend, a functioning reactor leading to a critical mass supply of \"element 94\" was not feasible to them in the projected span of the war. But let us, for a mome nt, assume that the Allied commando raid had not taken place. The German failures with graphite moderated reactors were already a matter of record, and it was obvious to them that there were significant technological and engineering hurdles to be surmounted before a reactor came into production. On the other hand, the German s already had the necessary technology to enrich U 235 for a bomb, and thus uranium enrichment constituted the best, most direct, and technologically feasible route to the acquisition of a bomb within the expected span of the war for the Germans. More on that technology in a moment. One now has to deal with yet an other component of the Allied Legend. American progress in the plutonium bomb, from the moment Fermi successfully comp leted and tested a functioning reactor in the squash court at th e University of Chicago, appeared to be running fairly smoothly, until fairly late in th e war, when it was discovered that in order to make a bomb from plutonium, the critical mass would have to be assembled much faster than any existing Allied fuse technologies could accomplish.

As we shall see in the next chapter, this fact gives rise to serious doub ts about the state of \"success\" in the Manhattan Project in late 1944 and early 1945. So what were the actual technologies available to Nazi Germany for isotope enrichment and separation, and how did it compare to similar technologies employed at Oak Ridge for efficiency and output? Difficult as it seems to accept, the fact of the matter is that Nazi Germany had \"at least five, and po ssibly as many as seven, serious isotope separation development programs underway.\" 16 One of these, an \"isotope sluice\" develo ped by Drs. Bagge and Korsching, two of the scientists interred at Farm Hall, was brought to such a state of efficiency by mid-1944 that a single pass of uranium through it would enrich it to four times that prod uced by a single pass through the gaseous diffusion gates at Oak Ridge! 17 16 Hydrick, op. cit., p. 25. 17 Ibid. 35"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" Contrast this with the end-of-w ar difficulties being faced by the Manhattan Project.

Simila rly, the more efficient German techno logy may also have allowed for relatively smaller separation facilities. Good as it was, however, the is otope sluice was not Germany's most efficient or technologicall y advanced means of uranium enrichment. This was the centrifu ge, and its progeny - designed by nuclear chemist Paul Hartek - the ultracentrifuge. 19 American engineers, of course, knew of this possibility, but there was a significant drawback they had to face: the high ly corrosive uranium gases used in this technology made it unf easible to rely on centrifuges as a means of enri chment. On the German side, however, this was a solved problem. A special alloy called Bondur was developed precisely for use in centrifuges. 20 But even centrifuge technology was not, howeve r, the best available method the Germans had. 18 Hydrick, op. cit., p. 25. 19 The same technology was captured by the Soviet Union and further perfected in its own bomb program. On the post-war German side, such ultra- centrifuges were provided by the Siemens company and other German firms first to South Africa in its own bomb program (q.v. Rogers and Cervenka, The Nuclear Axis: West Germany and South Africa, pp. 299-310). In other words, the technology is not only originally German, but is advanced enough to be employed today. It should be noted that, as of the mid-1970s, several of the Germans involved in the corporate development of centrifuge enrichment facilities for the Federal Republic (West Ge rmany) had ties to the third Reich's bomb project, among them Prof. Karl Winnacker, a former member of the I.G. larben board (p. 300). 20 Hydrick, op. cit., p. 25. 37"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" Baron Manfred von Ardenne, a rich eccentric and self-taught nuclear physicist and inventor, and his close associate of physicist Fritz Houtermanns, both correctly cal culated the critical mass for a U 235 atom bomb in 1941, and with funds from Dr. Ing.

This is the \"program\" the Allied Legend fo cuses on, and the one most people think of when they thi nk of the German atom bomb effort.

Why the Reichspost? For one thing, it afforded an effective cover for the program, which, like its Am erican counterpart, appears to have been compartmentalized under a number of government agencies, many having no plausible connection with a large secret weapons research effort. Second ly, and more significantly, the Reichspost was awash with mone y, and could therefore have provided some of the massive fundi ng necessary to the project, a true \"black budget\" oper ation in every sense. And finally, the head of the Reichspost was, perhaps not coincidentally, an engineer: Dr. Ing. Ohnesorge. It is, from the German point of view, a logical choice. Even his last name, \"Ohn esorge\", meaning \"without sorrow or regret\", is an ironic twist to the story. What was the method of separa tion and enrichment developed by von Ardenne and Houtermanns? Very simply, it was the cyclotron itself. Von Ardenne had invented a modification of the cyclotron - electromagnetic separati on tanks - very similar to Ernst O. Lawrence's \"beta calutrons\" in the United States. It is to be noted, however, that von Ardenne had completed his modifications in April of 1942, whereas General Groves in the Manhattan Project would not have Lawrence's beta cal utron at Oak Ridge for fully a year and a half after that! 23 \"In addition, the i on plasma source Ardenne had designed for his is otope separator to sublime the uranium compound was far superi or to that provided for the calutrons.\" So efficient, in fact , was Von Ardenne's version as a source for emitting particle rays, that to this day it is known as \"the Ardenne source.\" 24 Von Ardenne himself is a mysterious figure, for after the war he was one of the few German scientists to deliberately opt to cooperate with the Soviet Union ra ther than the Western Allies.

So what is the likely scenario, as it has emerged thus far? What conclusions may be drawn? (1) There were several German bo mb and enrichment projects, compartmentalized to maintain security, perhaps being coordinated by some as yet or hitherto unknown entity. In any case, it appears that one such serious program was at least nominally being coordinated by the Deutsche Reichspost under its chief, Dr. Ing. Wilhelm Ohnesorge; (2) The most significant enrichme nt and separation projects were not being conduc ted by Heisenberg or his circle, or for that matter, by any of the more \"high profile\" German scientists, save perhaps Harteck and Diebner. This suggests that perhaps the more famous scientists were being used as \"fronts\" and being kept out of the loop of the most serious and significant tec hnological achievement s as a matter of security. Had they been involved in such efforts and then subsequently kidnapped or as sassinated by the Allies - a thought that certainly occurred to the OSS 26 - then the German program would have be en severely crippled and exposed; 25 Henshall, op. cit, p. 156. 26 Powers, op. cit., pp. 379-382.

The case is strong because: (a) No Buna was ever produced ther e in spite of thousands of scientists, technicians, engine ers, contract and slave laborers working there; (b) The site was close to the uran ium ore fields of the Czech and German Sudentenland, being located in Polish Silesia; (c) The site was close to plentiful water supplies, also needed in isotope enrichment; (d) It was close to rail and road networks; (e) It was close to plentiful (slave) labor; (f) And finally -though not yet disc ussed - it was close to several large underground secret we apons production and research facilities in lower Si lesia, and was cl ose to one of the two alleged test sites of German atom bomb tests during the war; (5) it may reasonably be assumed, in addition to the \"Buna factory\", that the Germans cons tructed smaller facilities in the area for separation and enrichment of isotope, using the Buna plant's production as feedstock for these other facilities. 27 27 Powers, op. cit., p. 74. Powers also mentions another problematical fact concerning the Clusius-Dickel method of thermal diffusion, that we will encounter in chapter 7: \"One pound of U-235 was not a daunting figure, and Frisch calculated that 1,000,000 Clusius- Dickel tubes for thermal diffusion of uranium isotopes could produce it in a matt er of weeks.

Interestingly enough, there does exist, from 1938, an Austrian patent for a device known as a \"Molecular Bo mb,\" a bomb that upon examination is an early ve rsion of a hydrogen bomb. Atomic bombs, of course, supply the necessa ry heat to get hydrogen atoms to collide and produce the much more enormous and terrible energies of thermonuclea r hydrogen fusion bombs. Secondly, it may now clearly be seen why, of all the German scientists working on the atom bomb, that Manfred Von Ardenne was the one nuclear scientist that Adolf Hitler most often went personally to visit.28 In any case, all the evidence poin ts to the conclusion that there was a large, very well-funded, a nd very secret German isotope enrichment program during the war, a program successfully disguised during the war by the Nazis, and covered-up after war by the Allied Legend. But this too ra ises its own questions. How close was that program to acquiring su fficient stocks of weapons grade uranium to make a bomb (or bo mbs). And secondly, why did the Allies after the war go to such stupendous lengths to cover it up? As a final note to this chapter, and a tantalizing indication of further mysteries that will be inves tigated subsequently in this work, there is a report, declassified by the National Security Agency only in 1978; the report is apparently a decoded intercept from the Japanese embassy in Stockholm to Tokyo.

I am sending you, in one group, all those reports on what is called the atom- splitting bomb: It is a fact that in June of 1943 the German Army tried out an utterly new type of weapon against the Russians at a location 150 kilometers southeast of Kursk. Although it was the entire 19th Infantry Regiment of the Russians which was thus attacked, only a few bombs (each round up to 5 kilogr ams) sufficed to utterl y wipe them out to the last man. Part 2. The following is according to a statement by Lieutenant- Colonel UE(?) I KENJI, advisor to the attache in Hungary and formerly (?on duty?) in this country, who by chance saw the actual scene immediately after the above took place: \"All the men and the horses (?within the area of?) the explosion of the shells were charred black and even their ammunition had all been detonated. \" Moreover, it is a fact that the same type of war material was tried out in the Crimea, too. At that time the Russians claimed that this was poison-gas, and protested that if Germany were ever again to use it, Russia, too, would use poison-gas. Part 3. There is also the fact that recently in London - in the period between October and the 15th of November - the loss of life and the damage to business buildings through fires of unknown origin was great. It is clear, judging especially by the articles about a new weapon of this type, which have appeared from time to time recently in British and American magazines - that even our enemy has already begun to study this type. To generalize on the basis of all these reports: I am convinced that the most important technical advance in the present great war is in the realization of the atom-splitting bomb. Therefore, the central authorities are planning, through research on this type of weapon, to speed up the matter of rendering the weapon practical. And for my part, I am convinced of the necessity for taking urgent steps to effect this end. Part 4.

The American military authorities have likewise warned that the American east coast might be the area chosen for a blind attack by some sort of flying bomb. It was called the German V-3. To be specific, this device is based on the principle of the explosion of the nuclei of the atoms in heavy hydrogen derived from heavy water.

Naturally, there have been plenty of examples even before this of successful attempts at smashing individual atoms. However, Part 5. as far as the demonstration of any practical results is concerned, they seem not to have been able to split large numbers of atoms in a single group. That is, they require for the splitting of each single atom a force that will disintegrate the electron orbit. On the other hand, the stuff that the Germans are using has, apparently, a very much greater specific gravity than anything heretofore used. In this connection, allusions have been made to SIRIUS and stars of the \"White Dwarf\" group. (Their specific gravity is (?6?) 1 thousand, and the weight of one cubic inch is 1 ton.) In general, atoms cannot be compressed into the nuclear density. However, the terrific pressures and extremes of temperature in the \"White Dwarfs\" cause the bursting of the atoms; and Part 6. There are, moreover, radiations fr om the exterior of these stars composed of what is left of the at oms which are only the nuclei, very small in volume.

A fuel-air device would at least account for the charring. The tremendous heat produced by such a bomb could also conceivably detonate ammunition.

It originates within the Manhatta n Project on December 28, 1944, from Eric Jette, th e chief metallurgist at Los Alamos. One may imagine the desperation it must have triggered, however, since the Manhattan Project had consumed two billion dollars all in the pursuit of plutonium and uranium at om bombs. By this time it was of course apparent that ther e were significant and seemingly insurmountable problems in designing a plutonium bomb, for the fuses available to the Allies were simply far too slow to achieve the uniform compression of a plutonium core within the very short span of time needed to initiate uncontrolled nuclear fission. That left the uranium bomb as the more immediately feasible alternative - as the Germans had discovered years earlier - to the acquisition of a functioning weapon w ithin the projected span of the war. Yet, after a veritable hemorrha ge of dollars in pursuit of the latter objective, the Manhattan Project was far short of the necessary critical mass for a uranium bomb. And with the inevitability of an invasion of Japan looming, the pressure on General Leslie Groves to produce results was immense. The lack of a sufficient stockpile , after years of concerntrated all-out effort, was in part explai nable, for two years earlier Fermi had been successful in constructio n of the first functioning atomic reactor. That success had spurred the American project to commit more seriously to the pursuit of a plutonium bo mb. Accordingly, some of the precious and scarce refined and enriched uranium 235 coming out of Oak Ridge and Lawren ce's beta calutrons was being siphoned off as feedstock for enri chment and tran smutation into plutonium in the breeder reacto rs constructed at Handford, Washington for the purpose. Thus , some of the fissionable uranium stockpile had been deliberately diverted for plutonium production. 3 The decision was a logical one a nd the Manhattan Project decision- makers cannot be faulte d to taking it. The r eason is simple. Pound for weapons grade pound, a pound of plutonium will produce more bombs than a pound of uranium.

And let us not forget what had just happened in I urope to sour the mood of \"those in the kn ow\" in the United States even further. There, six months after the Alli ed landings in Normandy and the headlong dash across France, Allie d armies had stalled on the borders of the Reich. Allied in telligence analys ts confidently reassured the generals that no further signif icant German military offensive was possible, and their optimism was reflected in the general mood of the citizenry in France, Britain, and the United States. The mood was brutally shattered when, on December 16, 1944, the German Army and Luftwaff e mounted one last, desperate offensive with secretly husbanded reserves in the Ardennes forest, scene of their 1940 triumph agai nst France. Within a matter of hours, the offensive had br oken through American lines, surrounded, captured, or otherwise decimated the entire 116th American infantry division, and days later, surrounded the 101st Airborne division at Bastogne, and appeared well on the way to crossing the Meuse River at Namu r. On December 28, 1944, when the memo was written, the German offensive had been stalled, but n o t stopped. For the Allied officers privy to intelligence reports and \"in the loop\" on the Manhattan Project, th e offensive was possibly seen as confirmation of their worst fears: the Germans were close to a bomb, and were trying to buy time. The horrible thought in the back of every Allied scientist's a nd engineer's head must have been that after all the Allied military successes of the previous years, the race for the bomb could still be won by the Germans. And if they were able to produce enough of them to put unbearable pressure on any one of the Western Allies, th e outcome of the war itself was still in doubt.

If the stocks of we apons grade uranium ca. late 1944 - early 1945 were about half of what they needed to be after two years of research and production, and if this in turn was the cause of Senator Byrnes' concern, how th en did the Manhattan Project acquire the large remaining amount or uraniu m 235 needed in the few months from March to the dr opping of the Little Boy bomb on Hiroshima in August, only five months away ? How did it accomplish this feat, if in feet after some three year s of production it had only produced less than half of the needed supp ly of critical mass weapons grade uranium? Where did its missing uranium 235 come from? And how did it solve the pressing problem of the fuses for a plutonium bomb? Of course the answer if that if the Manhattan Project was incapable of producing enough en riched uranium in that short amount of time - months rather than years - then its stocks had to have been supplemented from extern al sources, and there is only one viable place with the necess ary technology to enrich uranium on that scale, as seen in the previ ous chapter. That source was Nazi Germany. But the Manhattan Proj ect is not the only atom bomb project with some missing uranium. Germany too appears to have suffered the \"missing uranium syndrome\" in the final days prior to and immediately after the end of the war. But the problem in Germany's case is that the missing uranium it not a few tens of kilos, but several hundred tons. At this juncture, it is worth citing Carter Hydrick's excellent research at length, in order to exhibit the full ramifications of this problem: From June of 1940 to the end of the war, Germany seized 3,500 tons of uranium compounds fro m Belgium - almost three times the amount Groves had purchased.... and stored it in salt mines in Strassfurt, Germany. Groves brags that on 17 April, 1945, as the war was winding down, Alsos recovered some 1,100 tons of uranium ore from Strassfurt and an additional 31 tons in Toulouse, France ..... And he claims that the amount recovered wa s all that Germany had ever held, asserting, therefore, that Germ any had never had enough raw material 5 Hydrick, op. cit, p. 13. 58"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"to process the uranium either for a plutonium reactor pile or through magnetic separation techniques. Obviously, if Strassfurt once held 3,500 tons and only 1,130 were recovered, some 2,370 tons of uranium ore was unaccounted for - still twice the amount the Manhattan Project possessed and is assumed to have used throughout its entire wartime effort.... The material has not been accounted for to this day.... As early as the summer of 1941, according to historian Margaret Gowing, Germany had already refined 600 tons of uranium to its oxide form, the form required for ionizing the material into a gas, in which form the uranium isotopes could then be magnetically or thermally separated or the oxide could be reduced to a metal for a reactor pile. In fact, Pr ofessor Dr. Riehl, who was responsible for all uranium throughout Germany during the course of the war, says the figure was actually much higher.... To create either a uranium or plutonium bomb, at some point uranium must be reduced to metal. In the case of plutonium, U 238 is metalicized; for a uranium bomb, U 235 is metalicized. Because of uranium's difficult char acteristics, however, this metallurgical process is a tricky one. The United States struggled with the problem early and still was not successful reducing uranium to its metallic form in large production wuantities until late in 1942. The German technicians, however,... by the end of 1940, had already processed 280.6 kilograms into metal, over a quarter of a ton. 6 These observations require some additional commentary. First, it is to be noted that Nazi Germa ny, by the best available evidence, was missing approximately two thousand tons of unrefined uranium ore by the war's end. Where did this ore go? Second, it is clear that Nazi Ge rmany was enriching uranium on a massive scale, having refined 600 tons to oxide form for potential metalicization as early as 1940. This would require a large and dedicated effort, with thousands of technicians, and a commensurately larg e facility or facilties to accomplish the enrichment. The figure s, in other words, te nd to corroborate the hypothesis outlined in the previous chapter that the I.G. Farben \"Buna\" factory at Auschwitz was no t a Buna factory at all, but a huge uranium enrichment facility. However, the date would imply 6 Hydrick, op. cit., p. 23, emphasis added. 59 "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"another such facility, located elsewh ere, since the Auschwitz facility did not really begin produc tion until sometime in 1942. Finally, it also seems clear th at the Germans possessed an enormous stock of me tallic uranium. But what was the isotope? Was it U 238 for further enrichment and separation into U 235 , was it intended perhaps as feedstock for a reactor to be transmuted into plutonium, or was it already U 235 , the necessary material for a uranium atom bomb? Given the statements of the Japanese military attache in Stockholm cited at the en d of the previous chapter - that the Germans may have used an at omic or some other weapon of mass destruction on the Easter n Front ca. 1942-43, and given Zinsser's affidavit cited in the first chapter of an atom bomb test in October of 1944, it cannot be conclusively denied that some of this enormous stockpile may also have been U 235 , the essential component for a bomb. In any case, these figures strongly suggest that the Germans, ca. 1940-1942 were signif icantly ahead of the Allies in one very important aspect of atom bomb production: the enrichment of uranium, and therefore, this su ggests also that they were demonstrably ahead in the race fo r an actual functioning atom bomb during this period. But the figures also rais e another disturbing question: where did this uranium go? One answer lies in the mysteri ous case of a U-boat, the U-234, captured by the Americans in 1945. *** The case of the U-234 is well-known in literature about the Nazi atom bomb, and of course the Allied Legend is that none of the material on board the U-boat found its way into the American atom bomb project. None of this could be further from the truth. The U-234 was a very large mine-laying U-boat that had been adapted as an undersea fr eighter to carry larg e cargoes. Consider then the following \"cargo manife st\" of the U-234's very odd cargo: 60"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"(1) Two Japanese ollicers; 7 (2) 80 gold-lined cylinders containing 560 kilograms of uranium oxide; 8 (3) Several wooden cases or barrels full of \"water\"; ( 4 ) I nfrared proximity fuses; (5) Dr. Heinz Schlicke, inventor of the fuses. When the U-234 was being loaded with its cargo in Germany for the outward voyage, its radio ope rator, Wolfgang Hirschfeld, observed the two Japanese officers writing \"U 235 \" on the paper wrapping of the cylinders prior to their being loaded into the submarine. 9 Needless to say, this observation has called forth the full range of debunking techniques normally applied by skeptics to UFO sightings: low sun angles, poor lighting, distance was to great to see clearly, etc. etc. This is no surprise, for if Hirschfeld saw what he saw, then the enormous implications were obvious. The use of gold lined cylinders is explainable by the fact that uranium, a highly corrosive metal, is easily contaminated if it comes into contact with other unstable elements. Gold, whose radioactive shielding properties are as great as l ead, is also, unlike lead, a highly pure and stable element, and is therefore the element of choice when storing or shipping highly enriched and pure uranium for long periods of time, such as a voyage. 10 Thus, the uranium oxide on board the U-234 was highly enriched uranium, and most likely, highly enriched U 235 , the last stage, perhaps, before being reduced to weapons grade or to metalicization for a bomb (if it was already in weapons grade purity). Indeed, if the Japanese officers' labels on 7 The two officers were Air Force Colonel Genzo Shosi, an engineer, and Navy Captain Hideo Tomonaga. When the captain of the U-234 made known his intentions to surrender the submarine, which was then en route to Japan aft er the German surrender, the two Japane se officers committed hari-kiri, and were buried at sea with full military honors by the Germans. 8 Hydrick's comment on the U-234's cargo manifest explains why the U- 234 was off limits to the American press following its surrender: \"Whoever first read the entry and understood th e frightening capabilities and potential purpose of uranium must have been stunned by the entry.\" (op. cit, p. 7) 9 Hydrick, op. cit., p. 5. 10 Ibid., p. 8. 61"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"the cylinders were accura te, it is likely that it was at the final stage of purity before metallicization. The cargo of the U-234 was so sensitive, in fact, that when the U.S. Navy prepared its own cargo manifest for the German submarine on June 1 6, 1945, the uranium oxide had entirely disappeared from the list. 11 Significantly, within a week of the appearance of the U.S. Navy' s version of the U-234's cargo manifest, Oak Ridge's output of enriched uranium very nearly doubled. 12 This in itself is highly suspect, since as late as March of 1945, as we have already seen, a U. S. Senator is worried about the failure of the Manha ttan Project, so much so that he writes President Roosevelt a memorandum on the subject, and of course, we have also already seen that the chief metallurgist of Los Alamos laboratory indicates the stock of fissile U 235 is far short of the needed critical mass, and would remain so for several months. The conclusion is therefore simple , but frightening: the missing uranium used in the Manhattan Project was German, and that means that Nazi Germany's atom bomb project was much further along that the post-war Allied Legen would have us believe. But what of the other two items in the U-234's strange cargo manifest, the fuses and their inventor, Dr. Heinz Schilcke? We have already noted that by late 19 44 and early 194 5, the American plutonium bomb project had run af oul of some nasty mathematics: the critical mass of a plutonium bomb, \"imploded\" or compressed by surrounding conventional expl osives, would have to be assembled within 1/30 00th of a second, otherw ise the bomb would fail, and only produce a kind of \"atomic fizzling firecracker\", a \"radiological\" bomb producing very little explosion but a great deal of deadly radiation. This wa s a speed far in excess of the capabilities of conventional wire cabling and the ordinary fuses available to the Allied engineers. It is known that late in the time table of events leading to the Trinity test of the plutonium bom b in New Mexico that a design modification was intr oduced to the implosion device that incorporated \"radiation venting channels\", allowi ng radiation from 11 Hydride, op. cit., p. 9. 12 Ibid., p. 11 62"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"the plutonium core to escape and reflect o f f the surrounding reflectors as the detona tor was fired, within billionths of a second a f t e r t h e beginning of compression . There is no possible way to explain this modification other than by the incorporation of Dr. Schlicke's infrared proximity fuses into the final design of the American bomb, since th ey enabled the fuses to react and fire are the speed of light. 13 In support of this historic al reconstruction, there is a communication from May 25, 19 45 from the chief of Naval O p er at ions, to Portsmouth where the U-234 was brought after its surrender, indicating that Dr. Schlicke, now a prisoner of war, would be accompanied by three nava l officers, to secure the fuses and bring them to Washington. 14 There Dr. Schlicke was apparently to give a lecture on the fuses under the auspices of a \"Mr. Alvarez,\" 15 who would appear to be none other than well- known Manhattan Project scientist Dr . Luis Alvarez, the very man who, according to the A llied Legend, \"solved\" the fusing problem for the plutonium bomb! 16 So it would appear that the surrender of the U-234 to the Americans in 1945 solved the Ma nhattan Project' s two biggest outstanding problems: lack of suffi cient supplies of weapons grade uranium, and lack of adequate fusing technology to make a p l u t onium bomb work. And thhis means that in the final analysis the Allied Legend about the Germans having been \"far behind\" the Allies in the race for the atom bomb is simply a incorrect in the extreme in the best case, or a deli berate lie in th e worst. But the fuses raise another frightening specter: What were the Germans developing such highly sophisticated fuses for? Infrared heat- seeking rockets, which they had developed, would be one answer, 13 Q.v. Hydrick, op. cit, pp. 46-51, for a detailed discussion of this issue and the historical problems it poses for the Allied Legend. 14 Ibid., p. 46. 15 Ibid. 16 As I observed in my previous book, The Giza Death Star Deployed, Dr. Luis Alvarez also had some other strange distinctions to his credit, being one of the scientists allegedly involved with the alleged Roswell \"UFO\" crash, the CIA's subsequent \"Robertson Panel\" in the 1950s on UFOs and government policy, and subsequent cosmic ray experiments inside the 2 nd Pyramid at Giza. 63"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"and of course an implosion device to compress critical mass would be another. But what about the other miss ing German uranium mentioned previously? The mission of the U- 234 and its precious cargo thus raises certain other qu estions, and highlights other possibilities in this regard. It is a fact that throughout the war Germany and Japan both conducted long-rang e exchanges of officers and technology via aircraft and submarine - the exchange of technology being mostly a one-sided affair from Germany to Japan. It is conceivable that many of these voyages - just as with the U-234 - would have included similar transfers of uran ium stocks and high technology to Japan. Some of the missing uraniu m must therefore surely be looked for in the Far East, in the Japanese atom bomb program. 17 Similarly, during the war both Germany and Italy undertook long-range flights to Japan, the Germans using their special long- range heavy lift transport aircraft such as the Ju-290 for polar flights. It is conceivable that these flights and their Italian counterparts also involved the exch ange of officers and technology, if not a small amount of raw materi al as well. Some of the missing uranium probably also fell into the hands of the Soviets as the Russian armies steamrollered into Eastern Europe and finally into what would become the Soviet \" eastern\" zone of occupation in Germany. But why, after traveelling under radio silence from Germany, did the U-234 finally surrender its precious uranium, fuses, and \"water\", when its obvious destin ation was Japan? This is an intriguing question, and one taht unf ortunately cannot be answered here except briefly. Again, Cartee r Hydrick's superb research elaborates one highly probable hypothesis: U-234 was handed over to the US authorities on the orde rs of none other than Martin Bormann, in a maneuver designed to secure his and others' freedom after the war, and as part of a de liberate plan to continue Nazism and its agendas and research underground. 18 It is thus, on this view, 17 Q.v. chapter 7. 18 Q.v. part two.

An Unusual Exchange at Nuremberg At the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunals after the war, an amazing exchange occurred between former architect cum Nazi minister of armaments, Albert Speer, and Mr. Jackson, the chief American prosecutor. JACKSON: Now, I have certain information, which was placed in my hands, of an experiment which was carried out near Auschwitz and I would like to ask you if you heard about it or knew about it. The purpose of the experiment was to find a quick and complete way of destroying people without the delay and trouble of shooting and gassing and burning, as it had been carried out, and this is the experiment, as I am advised. A village, a small village was provisionally erected, with temporary structures, and in it a pproximately 20,000 Jews were put. By means of this newly invented weapon of destruction, these 20,000 people were eradicated almost instan taneously, and in such a way that there was no trace left of them; th at is developed, the explosive developed, temperatures of from 400 degrees to 500 degrees centigrade and destroyed them without leaving any trace at all. Do you know about that experiment? SPEER: No, and I consider it utterly improbable. If we had had such a weapon under preparation, I should have known about it. But we did not have such a weapon. It is clear that in chemical warfare attempts were made on both sides to carry out research on all the weapons one 66"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"could think of, because one did no t know which party would start chemical warfare first... 1 This exchange is remarkable in several respects, not the least of which is that its \"explosive contents\" are almost entirely overlooked in standard histories of the war and its aftermath. Previous chapters have presen ted evidence that there was a large, and very secret, uranium enrichment program inside Nazi Germany, beginning sometime ca. late 1940 or early 1941, and continuing, apparently unabated - as the surrende r of the U-234 w o u l d imply - right up to the end of the war. Zinsser's affidavit goes further, and alleges an actu al atom bomb test, complete with descriptions of all the signature s of an atom bomb: mushroom cloud, electromagnetic pulse effect s, and continued combustion of nuclear materials in the cloud. The Japanese military attache in Stockholm further corroborated the story with undeniably fantastic allegations of the German use of some type of weapon of mass destruction on the Easter n Front ca. 1942 (the siege of Sevastopol in the Crimea), to 1943, just days prior to the massive German offensive at Kursk. Now, at Nuremberg, we have a third corroboration of the use of some type of weapon of awesom e explosive power in the east by the Germans, this time from no less an individual than the chief American prosecutor at the Tribunal. And in his case, it is apparent that he is relating information gath ered by intelligence. It is worth pausing to consider the implications of the exchange between Jackson and former armaments Reichminister Speer. We shall begin with Speer. Albe rt Speer was successor to Dr. Fritz Todt as minister of arma ments and production for the entire Third Reich.

His methods in achieving this feat were simple but effective: German industry was decentralized and dispersed into smaller plants, and, to the extent possi ble, moved into underground bomb- proof factories. \"Modular\" cons truction techniques were employed wherever possible. For example, German U-boats were produced in modular fashion, in sections, fa r inland in such factories, and transported to ports for final as sembly. The deadly Type XXI U- boats with their exo tic and revolutionary underwater propulsion systems - allowing an underwater cruising speed in excess of 21 knots, an unheard of speed for th at time - were pr oduced in this fashion at the end of the war. But notably absent from Speer's comments is any indication that he was even aware of the huge extent of the German atom- bomb project and its enormous ur anium enrichment program. Lofty as his position in the Nazi hierarchy was, it would appear that Speer was entirely in the dark on the programs and totally oblivious to any progress that had been made. The reason for Speer's ignorance will be addressed in due course (and by Speer himself!), but suffice it to say, the German government, like its American counterpart, had rigidly \"compart mentalized\" its atom bomb production program and placed it under the tightest secu rity. But clearly, by the time of the exchange betwee n Jackson and him, Speer and the whole world had heard of the atom bomb. So Speer appears to obfuscate his answer somewhat by redirecting the topic to chemical warfare. The question of a revo lutionary chemical explosive is not, however, as far-fetched as it mi ght at first seem, for Jackson's comments suggest it by referring to temperatures of 400 to 500 degrees centigrade, far below the enormous temperatures produced by an atomic explosion.

His statements, along with those of the Japanese m ilitary attache in Stockholm cited in the previous chapter, afford a serious clue - and one often overlooked even by researchers into this 'alternative history\" of the war - into the nature of the Nazi 's secret weapons development and use, for it would appe ar that insofar as the third Reich possessed weapons of mass destruction of extraordinary power, atomic or otherwise, they were tested and used against enemies consider by the Nazi ideology to be racially inferior, and that means, in effect, they were used on the Eastern Front theater of the Reich's military operations. Thus we are also afforded a sp eculative answer to the all- important question: If the German s had the bomb, why didn't they use it? And the answer is, if they ha d it, they were far more likely to use it on Russia than on the Western allies, since the war in the East was conceived and intended by Hitler to be a genocidal war from the outset. And it certainly was that: fully one half of the approximately fifty million fata lities of World War Two were inflicted by the efficient Nazi war machine on Soviet Russia. The use of such weapons on th e Eastern Front by the Germans would also tentatively explain why more is no t known about it, for it is highly unlikely that Sta lin's Russia would have publicly acknowledged the fact. To do so would have been a propaganda disaster for Stalin's government. Faced with an enemy of superior tactical and operational competence in conventional arms, the Red Army often had to reso rt to threats of execu tion against its own soldiers just to maintain order a nd discipline in its ranks and prevent mass desertion. Acknowledgment of the existence and use of such weapons by the mortal enemy of Communist Russia could conceivably have ruined Russian morale and cost Stalin the war, and perhaps even topple d his government.

In this regard, it is significant that Zinsser expressed mystification that the test took place so close to a p opulated area. If Jacks on deliberately altered the location of the test, he did not alter the nature of its victims. But another possibility is that the event took place where he says it did, \"near\" Auschwitz. B. A Marshal, Mussolini, and the First Alleged Test Site at Rugen Island The question of the location of a possible German atom bomb test comes from five very unlikel y sources: an It alian officer, a Russian marshal's translator, and Benito Mussolini himself, an American heavy cruiser, and an island off the coast of northern Germany in the Baltic Sea. Before he and his mistress Clara Petacci were murdered by Communist partisans, and then later hung from meat hooks in Milan to be pelted with rocks from an angry mob. Benito Mussolini, by the end of the war re duced to a mere pu ppet of Hitler and governing a \"Fascist republic\" in Ge rman-controlled northern Italy, spoke often of the German \"wonder weapons\": The wonder weapons are the hope. It is laughable and senseless for us to threaten at this moment, without a basis in reality for these threats. The well-known mass destruction bombs are nearly ready.

The construction of each unit is fearfully complex and of a lengthy time of completion.2 It would be easy to dismiss Mussolini's statements as more delusional and insane ravings of a fascist dictator facing defeat, clinging desperately to forlor n hopes and tattered dreams. It would be easy, were it but for the weird corroboration supplied by one Piotr Ivanovitch Titarenko, a former military translator on the staff of Mars hal Rodion Malinovsky, who handled the Japanese capitulation to Russi a at the end of the war. As reported in the German magazine Der Spiegel in 1992, Titarenko wrote a letter to the Central Co mmittee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In it, he reported that there were actually three bombs dropped on Japan, one of which, dropped on Nagasaki prior to i t s actual bombing, did not e xplode. This bomb was handed over by Japan to the Soviet Union. 3 Mussolini and a Soviet marshal's military translator are not the only ones corroborating the strang e number of \"thr ee bombs\", for yet a fourth bomb may actually ha ve been in play at one point, being transported to the Far East on board the US heavy cruiser Indianapolis (CA 35), when the latter sank in 1945. 4 These strange testimonies call into question once again the Allied Legend, for as ha s been seen, the Manhat tan Project in late 1944 and early 1945 fa ced critical shortage s of weapons grade uranium, and had yet to solve the fusing problem for the plutonium bomb.

In this context it is also extremel y curious that this time frame in 1944 was, for the Allies, a banner year for atomic bomb scares. On Saturday, August 11, 1945, an article in the London Daily Telegraph reported Br itish preparations for German atom bomb attack on London the previous year. NAZIS' ATOM BOMB PLANS BRITAIN READY A YEAR AGO Britain prepared for the possibility of an atomic attack on this country by Germany in August, 1944. It can now be disclosed that details of the expected effect of such a bomb were revealed in a highly secret memorandum which was sent that summer to the chiefs of Scotland Yard, chief constables of provincial forces and senior o fficials of the defence services. An elaborate scheme was drawn up by the Ministry of Home Security for prompt and adequate measures to cope with the widespread devastation and heavy casualties if the Germans succeeded in launching atomic bombs on this country. Reports received from our agents on the Continent early last year indicated that German scientists were experimenting with an atomic bomb in Norway. According to these reports the bomb was launched by catapult, and had an explosive radius of more than two miles. In view of our own progress in devising an 'atomic' bomb the Government gave the reports serious consideration. Thousands of men and women of the police and defence services were held in readiness for several months until reliable agents in Germany reported that the bomb had been tested and proved a failure. 5 5 \"Nazis Atom Bomb Plans,\" London Daily Telegraph, Saturday, August 11, 1945, cited in Edgar Meyer and Thomas Mehner, Hitler und die ,,Bombe\", p. 37. 72"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" The August 1945 London Daily Telegraph Article about a 1944 German Atom Bomb Scare in Britain 73"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"This article, coming as it does a me re two days after the bombing of Nagasaki, and almost a year since the actual alert in Britain was called, deserves careful scrutiny. First, and most obviously, the al ert in Britain was apparently conducted entirely in secret, as law enfor cement, defense, and medical personnel were placed on high alert. The reason for security is obvious, since to have signaled a public alert would have notified the Germans that there we re Allied spies close enough to the German bomb program to know about its tests. Second, the site of the alleged test - Norway - is unusual in that the timing of the test would place it a full two years after the British commando raid on the Norsk hea vy water plant at Ryukon. This might indicate two things: (1) It might indicate that Hitler's interest in maintaining troops in Norway had more to do with the German atom bomb project than anything else, sinc e, if the report was accurate to begin with, it would indica te a large scale German atom bomb effort was underway there; (2) Conversely, the re port may have been deliberately inaccurate, i.e., there may really have been a test, but one that took place somewhere else. Third, the presumed \"alert\" co ntinued from August 1944 \"for several months,\" that is, the alert could con ceivably have stretched into October, i.e., in to the time frame of the test mentioned in Zinsser's affidavit. Thus, the news account indicates something else: Allied intelligence was aware, and genuinely fearful, of German atom bomb testing. Fourth, the article mentions th at the test concerned a bomb launched from a \"catapult\". The V-l \"buzz bomb\", the first generation of the cruise missile, was launched from large steam- driven catapults.

The alert was canceled when the test was proven a failure. The question is, what failed? Was it the bomb i t s e l f ? T he delivery system? or both? An answer lies, perhaps, in an other curious news article that appeared in the British press almost a year earlier, on Wednesday, October 11, 1944, in the London Daily Mail: BERLIN IS 'SILENT' 60 HOURS STILL NO PHONES STOCKHOLM, Tuesday Berlin is still cut off from the rest of Europe to-night. The 60- hours silence began on Sunday morning - and still there is no explanation for the hold-up, which has now lasted longer than on any previous occasion. The Swedish Foreign Office is unable to ring up its Berlin Legation. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the major crisis between the Wehrmacht and the Nazi Party ha s come to a head and that \"tremendous events may be expected.\" To-day's plane from Berlin to Stockholm arrived four hours late. It carried only Germans, two of whom appeared to be high officials. They looked drawn and pale, and when Swedish reporters approached them they angrily thrust their way out of the Swedish Aero-Transport offices, muttering: \"Nothing we can say.\" German papers arriving here on to-day's plane seem extraordinarily subdued, with very small headlines. It is pointed out, however, in responsible quarters that if the stoppage were purely the technical result of bomb damage, as the Germans claimed, it should have been repaired by now. 6 6 Walter Farr, \"Berlin is 'Silent' 60 H ours: Still No Phones,\" London Daily Mail, Wednesday, October 11, 1944, cited in Meyer and Mehner, Hitler und die ,,Bombe\" p. 81, emphasis added. 75"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" The October 1944 Daily Mail Article about Berlin Telephone Service Disruption 76"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Of course we now know what was not known in Oc tober of 1944: when an atomic or thermonuclear bomb is detonated, the extreme electromagnetic pulse knocks out or interferes with electrical equipment for miles from the detonation site, depending on the size of the blast, the proximity of su ch equipment to it, and the degree of \"shielding\" such equipment ha s. For the normal, non-military phone lines in Berlin, the strang e disruption of phone service is explainable precisely as the result of such an electromagnetic pulse. But this would imply that such a pu lse, if the result of an atom bomb test, be considerably clos er to Berlin than Norway. Presumably if telephone service in Berlin was affected by an atom bomb test in Norway, similar disr uptions would have occurred in large cities that were much clos er to the test, such as Oslo, Copenhagen, or Stockholm. Ye t, not such disruptions are m e n t ioned; only Berlin appears to have been affected. 7 Thus, if the atom bomb test mentioned in the 1945 London Daily Telegraph article occurred, then one must look for a site considerably closer to Berlin than Norway. The Daily Mail phone service disruption article stands as clear corroboration of the probable test of a German atom bomb some time in October of 1944, the same time frame as Zin sser's affidavit, and within the time frame mentioned in the Daily Telegraph article about a secret alert in Britain from August of 1944, and continuing for \"several months.\" But the Daily Mail's phone service disruption article does more: it suggests why the Germans may have considered the test a failure. At that time the effe cts of nuclear explosions - electromagnetic pulse and disrupt ion of electrical equipment, radioactivity and fallout - were still largely unknown and not well understood. The Berlin telephone service was on e of the finest, if not the finest, in the world at the time. 8 The Nazis may very well 7 There is another possibly, though extremely unlikely explanation, for the lack of reports in other cities. Very simply, it may reflect a lack of intelligence from those areas. 8 Up to the very end of the war, for example, the cable lines between Berlin and Tokyo remained open, allowing the Japanese to send condolences to the Nazi government even as Russian tanks we re rolling over the streets of the city. 77"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"have been shocked at this curious r e s u l t of their alle ged test of an atomic \"wonder weapon\", and therefore considered it a \"failure\" until more tests could be done a nd the phenomenon of electro- magnetic pulse more fully underst ood. After all, it would do no good, so to speak, to deploy the \"ultimate weapon\" only to be unable to receive the telephone call of surrender after having used it! And to the totalitarian and para noid Nazi state, a disruption of communications from its capital city to its provinces, armed forces, and occupied territori es was literally an un thinkable nightmare, being the perfec t opportunity for a coup d'etat. Finally, to round out the newspa per scavenger hun t, a curious series of articles from the L ondon Times between May 15 and May 25, 1945, covered a story about German troops on the Danish Baltic Sea island of Bornholm that refused to surrender to attacking Russian forces. 9 Bornholm was within one hundred miles of the German rocket site at Peenemunde , and quite close to an alleged atom bomb test site on the small island of Rugen on the Baltic coast close to the port city of Kiel. It is here on this island that Italian officer Luigi Romersa was the guest and eyewitness to a Germ an \"wonder weapon\" test on the night of October 11-12, 1944. After journeying by a night drive for two hours in the rain from Berl in, Romersa reached the island by motorboat. According to his statements to German atom bomb researchers Edgar Meyer and Thomas Mehner, the island was guarded by a special elite unit, which we can only presume was an SS unit, and that admission to the island was only granted by special passes issued directly by the OberKommano Der Most communications lines in Berlin were laid underground by the Deutsche Reichspost before the war for the expr ess purpose of mitigating phone service disruption during bombing attacks. If the phone service disruption was therefore a result of EMP from a nucl ear detonation, then the size of the detonation would have to have been rather large to cause this lengthy disruption of the entire city's telephone service for that length of time, shielded as the lines were by being underground. The other alternative, a second coup attempt, may be a possible explanation, but there is no mention of such an attempt in any literature. 9 Meyer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis der deutschen Atombombe, p. 51. 78"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Wehrmacht (OKW). 10 At this point, it is best to cite Romersa's own words: There were four of us: my two attendants, a man with worker's clothes, and I. \"We will see a test of the disintegration bomb. 11 It is the most powerful explosive that has yet been developed. Nothing can withstand it,\" said one of them. He hardly breathed. He glanced at his watch and waited until noon, the hour for the experiment. Our observation post was a kilometer from the point of the explosion. \"We must wait here,\" the man with the worker's clothes ordered, \"until this evening. When it is dark we may leave. The bomb gives off deathly rays, of utmost toxicity. its effective area is much larger than the most powerful conventional bomb.

They entered and quickly shut the door. \"Everything is kaput,\" one of them said, as he removed his protective clothing. We also eventually had to put on white, coarse, fibrous cloaks. I cannot say what material this cloak was made of, but I had the impression that it could have been asbestos, the headgear had a piece of mica-glass 12 in front of the eyes. Having donned this clot hing, the observation pa rty then left the bunker and made its way to ground zero: The houses that I had seen only an hour earlier had disappeared, broken into little pebbles of debris , as we drew nearer ground zero, 13 the more fearsome was the devastation.

And the test does appear to have involved use in a \"populated area\" with houses and so on, in similar fashion to prosecutor Jackson's exchange w ith Speer, and Zinsser's own comments in his affidavit. However, Romersa, apparently a careful observer, fails to make any mention of a fusion of soil into silicate glassy material that also normally accompanies a nuclear blast close to the ground. But whatever was tested at R ugen, it does have enough of the signatures of an atom bomb to suggest that this is, in fact, what it was. Most importantly it is to be noted that it coincides with the time frame of Zinsser's affidavit and the phone service outage in Berlin, and the timing of the British alert. 15 Finally, it is perhaps quite significant that during this same time frame, Adolf Hitler finally signed an order for the development of the atom bomb. In context, this can only mean that he has given ap proval to develop more of a weapon already tested. 16 C. The Three Corners (Dreiecken) and the Alleged Test at the Troop Parade Ground at Ohrdruf A more controversial allegation, however, concerns the alleged test of a high yield atom bomb by the SS at the troop parade ground and barracks at Orhdruf, in south central Thuringia in March of 1945. As we shall see, this date too is sign ificant. Shortly after the German reunification in 1989, old rumors of an atom bomb test conducted by the SS late in the war in south central Germany, in what was formerly East Germany, again surfaced. The test is alleged to have taken place on March 4, 1945. 17 However, as 15 One significant difference that does em erge is that Zinsser's affidavit places the test close to the hours of twilight, whereas Romersa has it taking place in full daylight. The latter would ma ke sense, from a security point of view, since daylight would tend to mask the visibility of the blast more effectively from prying eyes in the distance. 16 Rose, op. cit., notes that Hitler actually gave a formal order in October of 1944 for the immediate development of the atom bomb. 17 Meyer and Mehner, Hitler und die „ Bombe \" , p. 226. 80"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"we shall soon see, ther e is an additional prob lem associated with the allegation of this test near the Three Corners. The Three Corners part of the st ory begins with a component of the Allied Lege nd. According to former Last German sources, one plausible reason for the swift ad vance of US General Patton's divisions on this region of Thur ingia was that the last Fuhrer Headquarters (Fuhrerhauptquartier), a facility code-named \"Jasmine\" by the Germans, was located in the vast underground facilities at Jonastal. 18 \"There exists an American document, under point number four, that informs us that the last (Fuhrer Headquarters) was not at the Ober salzburg, but in the region of Ohrdruf, \" 19 that is, in the region of the Three Corners. Thus, the Legend is elaborated: Patton's drive was to cut off the escape route of fleeing Nazis and seize Hitler's last se cret underground headquarters, and, presumably, the Grand Prize himself. This entire facili t y was part of a vast co mplex of underground sites under the command structure of the SS, and named \"S III\" - a designation not without its own suggestive possibili ties as we shall discover in subsequent parts of th is work - and the F uhrer Headquarters was but one component of this complex. 20 The problem with the view that this co mplex was simply a headquarters complex is that SS Obergruppenfuhrer Hans Kammler - a man with whom we shal l have much to do later in this work - was directly i nvolved in the construc tion of all facilities in the region since 1942, thus making it unlikely that they were constructed merely fo r Hitler's last headqu arters, since Kammler was directly involved with the most sensitive areas of the Reich's secret weapons resear ch and development. It is therefore more likely that they were a part of Kammler's vast SS Secret weapons black projects empire. 21 There is no mention of any of these facilities in surviving German archives, or, seemingly, any where else for that matter, an d yet, they are definite ly there for all to see. 22 18 Meyer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis der deutschen Atombombe, p. 209. 19 Meyer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis, p. 207. 20 Ibid., p. 213., \"Report of Mr. Oskar Muhlheim, Bad Durenberg.\" 21 Ibid., p. 239. 22 Ibid., p. 240. 81"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"So what were these facilities researching? Almost nothing was known about them until witnesses and relatives of witnesses began to talk after German reunification. One such man was Adolf Bernd Freier who, before his death in Argentina, wrote German researchers Edgar Meyer and Thomas Mehner a letter detailing his knowledge of the facilities gained while he was on the construction staff. There were, Freier allege d, facilities dedicated to special circular aircraft(!), to the \"Ame rika Raket\", the intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reachi ng the United States, and research facilities of atomic experiment s under the direction of Dr. Kurt Diebner, and a complete underground factory for the production of heavy water! 23 But most importantly, Freier al leges that the \"atomic weapon\" was ready on July 2, 1944! 24 What type of atomic weapon is meant here? A \"dirty\" radiol ogical bomb, designed to spray a vast area with deadly radioactive material but far short of an actual nuclear fission bomb? Or an actual atom bomb itself? Freier's choice of words is not clear. But one thing does stand out, and that is the date of July 2, 1944, the same month as the attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler in the - very aptly named - \"Bomb Plot\" approximately two weeks later. The consequence of a successful German development of even a ra diological bomb might thus be one of the primary motivations for the anti-Hitler conspirators to attempt to remove the Fuhrer wh en they did, a nd might explain their hidden logic in assuming that the Allies would negotiate with an anti-Nazi (or at le ast un-Nazi) pr ovisional German government in spite of the Allies' own dema nds for an unconditional surrender, for the possession of such a weapon would have given the conspirators considerable nego tiation leverage. And if the conspirators knew of the existence of the weapon, and of Hitler's plans to deploy it in actual use, it may have been the final moral compulsion for them to act. 23 Meyer and Mehner, das Geheimnis., p. 242. 24 Ibid., p. 245. According to Freier's allegations, the bomb was ready on July 2, 1944, but not its delivery system, meaning presumably the \"Amerikaraket\" (p. 249). 82"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"In any case, the most problematical aspect of the alleged test of an atom bomb by the Nazis in th e Ohrdruf-Three Corners region of Thuringia comes from a rather specific, and rather startling, assertion. According to Freier, the test took place on March 4, 1945 at the old troop parade ground at Orhdruf. There, a small scaffold about 6 meters high had been erected, a the top of which a small \"atomic weapon\" 25 was placed. The weapon, according to Freier, was \"100 g\", a mere one hundred grams! This is one of the mo st significant, and highly problematical, allegations regarding the real nature of the Nazi atom bomb project, made by someone supposedly i nvolved in it, for as will be immediately obvious, 100 grams is far short of the 50 or so kilograms of critical mass reporte dly needed for a uranium-based atom bomb, as has been seen, and it is still well below the amount needed for the critical mass fo r a typical plutonium bomb. Yet, Freier is insistent upon this point, and moreover alleges that all the \"slaves\", the luckless concentrati on camp victims that were forced to take part in the test, within a circle of 500-600 meters from ground zero were killed. 26 This would gi ve an area of approximately 1 to 1.2 kilometers of blast damage, roughly the effect of a modern ta ctical nuclear bomb. Such a blast radius would require an enormous amount of the then availa ble conventional explosives, and that amount would far exceed the mere 100 grams Freier alleges for the device. Thes e points indicates that the \"A- Waffe\" or \"atomic weapon\" was in fact a fully fledged atom bomb. So how does one explain the extr aordinarily smal l critical mass, especially since the Manhattan Pr oject was aiming for a uranium crititcal mass of around 50 kilograms? This question deserve serious cons ideration, for it affords yet another possible clue - if the a llegation is to be credited with accuracy - into the real nature of the Nazi atom bomb project. We have seen already that the project was developed under several different and discreet groups for r easons partly due to security, and for reasons partly due to the practical nature of the German 25 \"A -Waffe\", the wording again is not \"Atombombe\" but only A-waffe, or \"A-weapon\". 26 Meyer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis, p. 245. 83"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"program. For security reason, I believe th e \"Heisenberg\" group and the high-profile names associated with it were deliberately used by the Nazis as the \"fr ont\" group for pu blic, namely Allied, consumption. The SS security a nd intelligence apparatus would have undoubtedly concluded, correc tly, that these high profile scientists would be hi gh priority targets fo r Allied intelligence for kidnapping and assassination. Accordi ngly, it is highly unlikely that the Nazis would have concentrat ed any genuine atomic bomb secrets or development exclusively in the hands of this group. The very existence of the Allied Lege nd for so many years after the war is direct testimony to the success of this pl an. The real atom bomb development occurred far from the pryi ng eyes of Allied intelligence, under the auspices of the Reichspost and more importantly, under the direct auspices of the SS. The second facet of the German atom bomb program we have likewise previously encountered: its emphasis on what was practically achievable during the war. Hence, wh ile the Germans knew of the possibilities of plutonium and a plutonium-based atom bomb, and therefore knew that a functioning reactor used to produce plutonium for bombs woul d thereby enable Germany to develop more bombs for the same investment of fissile material, they also knew that a major tec hnical hurdle lay across the path: the development of a su ccessful reactor in the first place. Thus, as has been previously argued, they opt ed to develop a uranium-based bomb only, since uranium could be enriched to weapons grade purity without the necessity of th e development of a reactor, and since they alrea dy possessed the necessary tech nologies to do so, if employed en masse. Like its American Manhattan Project counterpart, the SS-ru n program relied on massive numbers of enrichment units to separate and purify isotope. Now let us extend this line of reasoning further. Germany was also seeking to be able to depl oy such bombs as warheads on its rockets. And that meant, given th eir limited lift capabilities, that the weight of the warheads had so mehow to be reduced by several orders of magnitude fo r the rockets to be able to carry them. And there is an economic factor.

And so we return to Freier's statement of a remarkably small 100 g atom bomb test at Ohrd ruf on March 4, 1945. There does exist a method by which much sma ller critical ma sses of fissile material can be used to make a bomb: boosted fissi on. Essentially, boosted fission simply relies on the introduction of some neutron- producing material - polonium, or heavy hydrogen: deuterium, or even tritium - to release more neutrons into the chain reaction than is actually released by the fissile critical mass assembly by itself. This raises the amount of free neut rons initiating chain reactions in the critical mass, and therefore a llows two very important things: (1) It allows slightly lower purity of fissile material - materially not considered of sufficient purity to be weapons grade without boosted fission - to be used for an actual atom bomb; and, (2) it requires less actual fissile material for the critical mass assembly to make a bomb. Thus, \"boosted fissio n\" would have afford ed the German bomb program a practical way to increas e the number of bombs available to them, and a reliable method for achieving an uncontrolled nuclear fission reaction with lo wer purity of enriched material. 27 it is perhaps quite signifi cant, then, that Freier's testimony concerning the Three Corners underground wea pons factories also mentions the existence of an underground h eavy water plant in the facilities, for heavy water, of course, c ontains atoms of deuterium and tritium(heavy hydrogen atoms with one and two extra neutrons in the nucleus respectively). 27 Q.v.

But there are interest ing, and intriguingly suggestive, corroborations of the test. According to Freier, Hitler himself was indeed in the Three Corners headquarters for a brief period at the end of march 1945. 28 It is known that Hitler did personally visit and address the officers of the German Ninth Army, operating in that precise area, in March of 1945., and stated to them that there were still things that needed to be \"finished\", an interesting comment if seen in the light of Freier's allegations that it was not the bomb that Germany ne eded, but the delivery systems. It does make sense that if there we re such a test, that Hitler would have been present as an observer to witness the final success of German science in delivering to him the \"ultimate weapon\". But perhaps the most persuasive bi t of evidence that there is far more about the end of World War Tw o than we have been told can be found in two exceedingly odd fact s that emerge from the Three Corners region of Thuringia in south central Germany. In a statement made on March 20, 1968, former German General Erich Andress was in the Three Corners region at the end of the war, when suddenly, more American military personnel(who were already occupying the area), arrived with jeeps and heavy transports, and immediately ordere d all the buildings and houses in the area to have their windows to tally blacked out, leaving one to conclude that the Americans were removing something from the area of great value to them, someth ing they wished no one to see. The second odd fact is even more cu rious, for it is a fact that, of all the areas in modern Germany, the re gion of Thuringia, precisely in the area of Jonastal and Ohrdruf, is the region of Germany with the highest concentration of b ackground gamma radiation. 29 So, what is really signified by the unique exchange of remarks between former Reich Minister of Armament s Albert Speer, and Chief American Prosecutor Jacks on at Nuremberg? That Jackson is privy to information similar in nature to reports only recently 28 Meyer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis, p. 228. 29 Meyer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis, p. 251. 86"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"declassiefied is clear from his question. That this information c o n c e r n s the real nature of Germ an atom bomb re search and its - what appear to be astounding ach ievements completely at variance with the postwar Allied Legend - would also seem to be indicated. And that Albert Speer seems either unwilling to talk about them candidly, or is simp ly entirely ignorant of them, also seems indisputable. Thus Jack son's question would seem to imply a test of the extent of Speer's knowledge of the program and his complicity in the wo tests at Rugen and Ohrdru f. If the Minister if Armaments for the entire Third Reich knew not hing of it, then indeed, we are dealing with a black Reich within the black Reich, a beast in the belly of the beast, of which even high ranking Nazis such as Speer knew very little, if anything. The great secret of World War Two, one which the victorious Allies and Russians wish to keep secret to th is day, was that Nazi Germany was indisputably first to reach the atom bomb, and was indisputably for a very brief period before the end of the war, the world's very first nuclear power. But why is the Allied and Russian secrecy continued even to the present day? The answer to that disturbing question will be addressed more completely in the subsequent parts of this book, for the answer, disturbing as it is, concerns far more than mere nuclear weapons. But why didn't the Nazis use their bombs if they had them? The answer to that question has already been partly addressed in this chapter: if they used any weapon s of mass destruction, nuclear or Otherwise, they would have been far more likely to have used them in a fashion consistent with thei r racist and genocidal ideology, as well as against the enemy that was their largest military threat: on the Eastern Front, against the S oviet Union, where a paranoid Stalinist regime would have been lo athe to admit to the world or to its own war-savaged people that they faced an enemy with overwhelming technological superi ority. Such an admission would likely have so demoralized the Russians, already forced to spend rivers of their own blood in ever y engagement with the Wehrmacht, that Stalin's regime itself may not have survived such an admission.

To this day, many Americans, even ones relative ly familiar with the operational details of Word War Two, believe that Germany had no aircraft even capable of reaching the United States and returning to Europe, much less of carrying a heavy en ough payload, or being available in sufficient numbers, to be of any military significance.

Are there indications that such studies and operations were contemplated by the Nazis? A. The Oberkommando der Luftwaffe's Unusual Map In 1943 the Su preme Command of the Luftwaffe (Oberkommando der Luftwaffe) c onducted a highly unusual study. The study consisted of a map, a ma p of lower Manhattan Island. On the map are concentric circles deta iling the blast and heat damage- radii of an atomic bomb detona tion over New York City. But the most unusual aspect of th is \"study\" is that it shows the detonation of an atom bomb in the 15-17 kiloton range, approximately the same yield as the Little Boy uran ium bomb dropped on Hiroshima, an odd \"coincidence\" in the series of \"odd coincidences\" we have- already encountered. The Luftwaffe's intentions are quite obvious and clear. The destruction of the financial and bu siness center of New York City would alone have been an unparalleled military and psychological blow against the American war effort. Beyond this, given the fact that New York City was an impor tant point of embarkation for American shipping and troops, as well as a nava l base, and a transportation hub for the entire Am erican northeast, such a blow would have been incalculable. For the Nazi leadership, such a blow would have made military and political sense. It would have demonstrated conclusively to the United States that Germany was capable of mounting significant military operations against the American mainland, and at levels of destructive capability that were militarily, economically, and psychologically devastating. From th eir point of view, such a blow would arguably been seen as weakening American resolve and perhaps, after a succession of sim ilar such blows against prominent targets such as Boston, Philadel phia, Washington DC or Norfolk, would conceivably have led to America's exit from the war, leaving Britain to follow not far behind.

Beyond th e relatively well- known Messerschmitt 264, a four engine bomber that looks far too similar to the Ameri can B-29 to be co incidental, Germany possessed in small numbers a quantity of heavy-lift, ultra-long range transport craft, including the four engine Junkers 290 and its massive six engine cousin, the Junkers 390.

In an article for the June 29, 1945 issue of the Washington Post, a report that originated from 21st Army Group headquarters outlines the frightening discovery that awaited Allied military personnel who came to occupy Norway after the Germ an forces there surrendered: R.A.F. officers said today that the Germans had nearly completed preparations for bombing New York from a \"colossal air field\" near Oslo when the war ended. \"Forty giant bombers with a 7,000 mile range were found on this base - the largest Luftwaffe field I have ever seen,' one officer said. \"They were a new type bomber developed by Heinkel. They now are being dismantled for study. German ground crews said the planes were held in readiness for a mission to New York. It is known that Heinkel undertook special modifications of its He 177 four engine heavy bomber late in the war, adapting it to carry large atom bombs, radiological bombs, and biological and chemical bombs. 2 Within the context of the SS atom bomb program and the earlier flight of the Ju 390 from France in 1944, however, a purpose immediately suggests itself. The lo ss of France to Allied forces in 1944 deprived the Luftwaffe of its large French airfields. Norway, however, as has already been stated, remained in German hands up until their very surrender, and th us constituted the only remaining base of operations available to the Germans for any type of offensive operation against the North American continent. The presence of such an airfield and its deliberate construction so late in the war also strongly suggests a connection to the SS atom bomb program in an entire ly different way, since its construction would like ly have fallen under the jurisdiction of the SS Building and Works Department , which was under the direction of none other than SS Obergruppenf uhrer Hans Kammler. It is also significant that jurisdiction over all long range aircraft was also in Kammler's hands by war's end, thus linking the precious long-range 2 Q.v.

Moreover, Mayer and Mehner speculate that at least two atom bombs were built and possibly transported on the mission of the U-234. In their view, the surrender of the U-boat to the Amer ican authorities thus not only provided the Manhattan Project with mu ch-needed stocks of enriched uranium, but quite possib ly also with two fully functional atom bombs as well. Professor Friedrich Lachner was assistant for twenty years to professor Mache at the Department for Technical Physics at the Technical University of Vienna . Familiar with aspects of the German bomb project, Lachner unburdened himself of his knowledge to researchers Ma yer and Mehner. Among his allegations were that at least one co mpleted bomb of German construction was transported from Thuringia to Salzburg by the SS near the end of the war. 3 Lachner's letter is intriguing fo r two reasons. First, because it corroborates the existence of a la rge atom bomb program in the Three Corners region, and corroborates Freier 's allegations of a successful test in Ma rch 1945. By mentioning the transportation of such weapons out of the region, he gives some credence to the idea that the U-234 might have been used to transport at least one such weapon to Norway. 4 But a more curious allegation is made in Lachner's letter to Mayer and Mehner, and with it, we begin to approach the even more horrendous potentialities of Nazi wartime secret weapons research. Citing the letter of a British espionage agent who was well-aware of the multi-tiered nature of the German atom bomb program, and who was aware of a \"t hird team that sought another 3 Mayer and Mehner, das Geheimnis, p. 81. Lachner also asserts unequivocally in his letter to Mayer and Mehner that the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was German (p. 82). Lachner also states that there were no less than fifteen atom bombs in German hands by th e war's end. Again, on first glance, this seems a sheer fantasy, unless they had already mastered the techniques of boosted fission. The Salzburg bomb story may not be fantasy, as American tank units were operating in the area late in the war (q.v. pp. 84-85) in conjunction with Patton's drive on Pilsen and Prague. 4 Italian officer Luigi Romersa mentions as well that the Russians captured two such bombs (Das Geheimnis, p. 105). 95"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"way\" of making the bomb (boosted fission) , 5 he then mentions a \"fourth team\": Yes, and then there was also the fourth team, about which we heard rumors during the last phase of the war. This was certainly so shadowy and fantastic, that one could only construe it as a ploy. But after the war it became evident that the world had avoided a colossal catastrophe by a hair's breath.... This fourth team worked in a field that was monstrous on a daily basis. And when I say this, I meant thereby that they experimented with things that a well-informed public would to thus very day think then to be unthinkable and unbelievable, and thus imaginary. I mean to imply that these specialists worked in conceptions that totally abandoned conventional physical laws. 6 Mayer and Mehner then point out the implications of the agent's remarks in an age long accustomed to think in terms of the destructive power of hydrogen bombs: That the Germans were working on an atom bomb no one may any longer question, but that they also possessed a team that was working on the destruction of the world is an unbelievable concept. This could only mean that there was a weapons system that possessed enormous range and degree of efficiency that lay beyond that of nuclear weapons technology. Did the Third Reich really prepare the Doomsday Weapon? And if so, where is this technology today? Was it discovered by the Allies or does it lurk secretly deep in the earth waiting for its rediscovery? If such an Ultimate Weapon has already been in existence for more than fifty years, then it is a legitimate question to ask what today's military really, actually possesses. 7 The truthfulness of these stupe ndous allegations appears to be substantiated by a brief remark uttered by Adolf Hitler to a gathering of Axis elit e in April 1944. Accord ing to Italian officer 5 Mayer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis, p. 89.

All my words are the purest truth. That you will see! 8 Bacteriological war? Bombs with an unbelievable working? Teams of specialists working in areas that defy conventional laws of physics that would threaten a global catastrophe? This is not the picture of a Germany tinkering with V-l buzz bombs, V-2s of limited operational range and strategic value, clumsy and belated attempts to construct a working atomic reactor, and tottering on the brink of total collapse that we have been led to believe. All the evidence presente d thus far tends to the opposite conclusion, that at a mini mum the Third Reich possessed functioning atom bombs and was pr eparing to use them against the West, if she had not already done so against Russia. So the cargoes intended to fly out of that Norwegian airfield may have not only been nuclear, but something far more horrendous. Already the path through Nazi Germany's nuclear programs have led into very unexpected places and developments, developments only made possible by the recent German reunification and the declassifi cation of German, British, and American archives that it provoked, and suggesting that behind that nuclear program lurks something even larger and far more monstrous.

Introduction: The Rediscove ry of the SS Sonderkommando, Kammler, and a Brush with \"the Legend\" As previous chapters have indicat ed, there is some entity within the Third Reich that appears to have coordinated extremely sensitive and secret weapons rese arch projects, including possible oversight of Germany's apparently large uranium enrichment program. However, this entity, as we shall subsequently see, was responsible for a great deal more th an that. It is necessary at this juncture to say something about it, however, as it now directly enters the picture in the speculat ive reconstruction of the strange death of the one, and the disappearance of the other, of these two very important generals. This entity first came to public light in the aftermath of World War Two, in the 1950s, in a se ries of publications in West Germany, and in a book by former German major Rudolf Lusar. These publications alleged that Nazi Germany had created and successfully tested \"u nusual\" aircraft, incl uding flying disks or saucers. Thus was born the \"Nazi Legend\" of the \"real origin\" of UFOs. More will be said about this Legend in the subsequent parts of this book. Here it suffices to note th at the Nazi Legend maintained that this secretive development occurred under the direct auspices of the SS. The allegations of an ultra-t op secret entity coordinating and controlling the Nazi s ecret weapons research in the final years of the war tended to be discounted, along with its more sensation component, the \"flying saucers\" themselves. Moreover, discounting these allegations was easy to do, si nce they rested upon the isolated testimony of a disenchanted Germ an major with definite Nazi sympathies (Lusar) and the \"eye witness\" statements of one or two others who came forward to corroborate the story, each with their own shady associations. All that gradually be gan to change, however, by a sequence of events ranging from the publication of a book by a former British intelligence officer, Tom A goston, in 1985, by the German reunification itself in 1989, which made a host of archives of the former East Germany available to researchers. A number of books 100"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"has appeared in Germany since the reunification made these archives accessible, and moreover, the lormerly inaccessible SS secret underground facilities and complexes finally became accessible to the public.

This body of work has been almost entirely ig nored in North America. 2 Agoston's work was the first indi cation from the \"mainstream\" that there may have been some thing behind the Nazi Legend. Agosto n revealed his st ory for the first time after his source, none other than close Kammler associat e at the famous Skoda Works, Dr. Wilhelm Voss, died. The story that Voss told Agoston at the end o f the war was, according to Agoston, in confidence. As Agoston notes rather sarcastically, Kammler boasted almost the perfect \"corporate resume\" and a documentable record of \"whole person management\" as a \"team player\": A modern day management consultant who was talent hunting for a \"total professional with total involvement\" would certainly have been fascinated by the bizarre curric ulum vitae Kammler could have submitted. He could demonstrate a \"track record\" in \"very senior appointments,\" with skill in putting across \"aggressive growth plans.\"... 2 The most prominent post-reunification German sources for this story are Friedrich Georg's series on secret weap ons, Hitler's Siegeswaffen series in thrcc volumes; and the studies of Edgar Mayer and Thomas Mehner, Das Geheimnis der Deutschen Atombombe; Die Atombombe und das Dritte Reich; Hitler un die ,,Bombe\"; Harald Fath's 1945 -Tthuringens Manhattan Projekt ami Geheime Kommandosache - S III Jonastal und die Seigeswaffenproduktion. Also not to be neglected is Robert K. Wilcox's Japan's Secret War: Japan's Race against Time to Build its Own Atomic Bomb, for the latter book raises the question of where Japan acquired its enrichment capability and stocks of uranium in no uncertain terms (see chapter 7 of this book).

Later he wa s called in to advise on the modalities for boosting the daily output of its gas chambers from 10,000 to 60,000.\" 5 All this is to say that not only was Kammler a butcher, but that by the war's end, H itler had \"concentrated more power in Kammler's hands than he had ever entrusted to a single person,\" 3 Tom Agoston, op. cit., p. 5. 4 Agoston, pp. 5-6. 5 Ibid., p. 6. 102"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"bar none. 6 If one were to compare Kammler's position to a similar hypothetical position in the former Soviet Union, such a position would mean that the general who (commanded) the SS-20 rockets in Europe and Asia (the Commander in Chief of Strategic Rocket Forces) would also head research, development, and production of missiles. In addition, he would be in charge of producing al l modern aircraft for the Red Ai r Force and have overall command of the mammoth civil engineering projects or the production centers in Siberia's sub-zero climate. Last, but very much not least, he would lead the national grid of gulags. To match Kammler's position in the SS, the Soviet general holding all these variegated commands would also be third in the KGB pecking order. 7 Indeed, one would have to add to Agoston's list, fo r such a Soviet general would also have had to be in charge of the coordination of all the most post-nuclear and super secret advanced scientific research and black projects in the entire Soviet Union. It is thus in the person of SS Obergruppenfuhrer Hans Kamtnler that all the lines of our investig ation meet: the Buna factory and slave labor of the camps, exploited for grizzly medical experimentation and labor in th e secret undergr ound laboratories and production facilities, the atom bomb project, and as will be seen in the subsequent parts of this book, even more horrendous and monstrous aircraft and weapons development. If there was a gold mine of information, then it wa s available in the blueprints and files that were locked in Kammler's vaults, or even more securely in his brain. It is this fact and Kammler's extraordinary dossier that make his post-war fate even more problematical. But what of Kammler's \"Special SS Command\" (Sonderkommando) structure itself ? What was it that was so revolutionary that Dr. Voss wo uld have required Agoston to maintain confidentiality until after his death? Voss had joined Skoda in 1938, when the plant was ceded to the Reich under the Munich Pact - Hitler, Ch amberlain, Mussolini and Daladier, allotting the Sudeten German areas of Czechoslovakia to Germany - 6 Agoston, op. cit., p. 4. 7 Ibid., p. 7. 103"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"and became an affiliate of H itler's principle arms maker Krupp. With his flair for quiet diplomacy, Voss was immensely popular with the Czech executives, who had remained in leading positions at the time of the German takeover of Skoda. Voss even saw to it that Czech workers, paid on the local and not Reich wages, were paid more money. 8 Also important to the Skoda-SS rela tionship is the fact that all of Bohemian Czechoslovakia became a \"Reich Protectorate,\" in effect turning total political, administrative, and military control of Bohemia over to the SS. It is in this context that the special relationship between Voss and Kammler developed. By quirk of fate, the careers of Kammler and Voss overlapped at Skoda, where they jointly set up and operated what was generally regarded by insiders as the Reich's most advanced high-technology military research center. Working as a totally independent undercover operation for the SS, the center was under the special auspices of Hitler and Himmler. Going outside the scope and field of Skoda's internationally coveted general res earch and development division, it worked closely with Krupp and was primarily concerned with analysis of captured equipment, including aircraft, and copying or improving the latest technical features. In so doing the SS group was to go beyond the first generation of secret weapons. 9 Thus one has the first component of this Special SS Command: the analysis, duplication, and improvement of all recovered foreign and enemy technology. This in itself is not surprising, since all major combatants during the war maintained such research facilities. The second thing one must note is the careful and deliberate camouflaging of the SS Special Command inside the normal engineering division of the Skoda works. But the real operational goals of this Special command were far more than the mere analysis of captured enemy equipment, as Voss detailed to Agoston. Its purpose was to pave the way for building nuclear-powered aircraft, working on the application of nuclear energy for propelling missiles and aircraft; laser beams, then sti ll referred to as \"death rays\"; a 8 Agoston, op. cit, p. 11. 9 Ibid., p. 12. 104"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"variety of homing rockets and to se ek other potential areas for high- technology breakthrough. In modem high-tech jargon, the operation would probably be referred to as an \"SS research think tank.\" Some work on second-generation secret weapons, including the application of nuclear propulsion for aircraft and missiles, was already well advanced. 10 Nuclear powered aircraft woul d require the development and miniaturization of functioning at omic reactors, something the Germans were not, according to the Allied Legend, supposed to have achieved. A nd though the mention of la sers seems to stretch one's credulity beyond all reason, there is credible evidence that the Germans were up to just that, and more besides. 11 But the most remarkable thing about this \"SS think tank\" was that it was established entirely wi thout the knowledge of Goring, Speer, or any of the other big-wigs or research centers in the Reich. 12 This would not only ex plain Speer's puzzlement at J a c k s o n ' s question that we enco untered earlier, but would also explain the apparent lack of in formation on the part of the Farm Hall scientists interred in England after the war. These two facts alone indicate that the SS Spec ial Command headquartered at the Skoda Works in Pilsen was more th an just a secret weapons project being run through ordinary channels. Unlike even its Manhattan Project counterpart, it had no c onnection to the standard branches of the German military, th e German state, or even the Nazi Party; it was entirely off the books. It is, in every sense that we have come to know it, a Black Proj ect, coordinating all black projects in Nazi Germany. So extensive was the mand ate given to this group that if there was a large uranium enrichment program underway in Germany for the production of atom bombs, then this is the entity most likely coordinating it. 13 10 Agoston, op. cit., p. 12. '' Q.v. the remaining parts of this book. 12 Ibid., pp. 12-13. 13 Agoston alludes to the existence and connection of the uranium enrichment program to the Kammler Staff when he states \"Even fissile uranium-235 was reportedly made available to Berlin's prime Axis ally.(p. 32).\" While the enormous implications of this statement are obvious, Agoston does not pursue the atom bomb component of the Kammler Staff in his book, 105"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Moreover, not only did Skoda's \"o vertly operating research and development division\" wo rk closely with the SS on some less sensitive projects, it \"provided a convenient cover for the Kammler Staff specialists, culled in great secrecy from Germany's research institutes to supplement the in-house experts.

All had to have the ability to tackle visionary projects. \" 14 The Kammler Staff Special Command even circulat ed top secret scientific paper and memos to the various scientists within the group itself via a central office of scientific reports. Some of these reports were then used as a basis of recruitment of top scientists. 15 So what was the Kammler Staff, or Kammlerstab, as outlined by Voss and Agoston? First, it was the continuation of \"normal\" science, free of the constraints of Nazi party ideology, but under the control of the SS! But it was much more. Not only wa s it a \"think tank ,\" but it was also a central clearing house fo r ideas, for mapping out precise technology trees fo r the acquisition of seco nd and third generation weapons. But it was more, it was also a fully-funded research Black Programs coordinating office with its own \"inexhaustible\" and expendable labor pool. All of it was coordinated by SS General Hans Kammler. All of it was headquartered at the Skoda Works in Pilsen. And one more thing. By the wa r's end, Kammler also had control of the Reich's heavy-lift long range transport aircraft, consisting of several Ju 290s and the two enormous Ju 390s, one of which, according to Agoston, made a polar flight to Japan on March 28, 1945. 16 though he surely would have suspected it. The link of the Auschwitz \"Buna plant\" to the SS via the death camp there already provides one link to Kammler, since the \"Buna plant\" fell und er SS jurisdiction via the camp itself, and thus the connection to Kammler is direct. 14 Agoston, op. cit, p. 13, emphasis added. 15 Ibid., p. 14 16 This fact is merely reported by Agoston without substantiation, leading one to the conclusion that the source of the information must have been Dr. Voss.

Hans Kammler General Kammler, in addition to his \"accomplishments\" in streamlining death camp efficien cy, his methodical and efficient leveling of the ruined Warsaw Gh etto and meticulous accounting of every last brick and stone remove d, his coordination of the most arcane, and perhaps the biggest, secret weapons black projects program in human history, has also another odd distinction to his credit. He of all th e high-ranking Nazis in dicted and tried at Nuremberg either posthumously or in absentia, was never formally indicted, much less brou ght to trial. He is altogether missing from the docket, and altogeth er just simply missing. Kammler has yet another distinct ion. He appears to have been not only a very accomplished me ssenger of death for others, but also appears to have achieved the astonishing feat of having died himself no less than four times, ea ch under different circumstances. Agoston commented at length on the odd assortment of \"facts\" surrounding Kammler's fate: brainchild of none other than Martin Bormann. The purpose of this special command was to evacuate... something. Cook reports that one of these enormous Ju 390s simply went missing at the end of the war. 107"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Analysis of the voluminous documentation (at has accrued since embarked on the first left of the fascinating project in 1949 shows crude discrepancies, the inconsistencies of which grow with almost every addition to the mosaic of information that enters the picture Basically three major facts stand out: 1. In almost four decades, official records show no positive confirmation of Kammler's death. No court of law, no media editor would accept the uncorrobor ated statement of \"unknown comrades,\" still so referred to in official records as conclusive evidence of death especially if the death was alleged to have taken place in the chaos of collapsing Germany. 2. The record shows no subsequent sworn corroborative statement Such a statement would automatically have been entered in the Red Cross and other dossiers on Kammler. 3. None of the persons reporting any of the four versions of the general's death had conformed with the prescribed duty of all servicemen to detach one-half of a dead man's soldier's paybook or officer's identity document, to the ne arest unit, relevant records office, Red Cross, or holding power, if the surviving serviceman had become a prisoner of war, to help notification of next of kin. Germans are traditionally meticulous and, to say the least, most sentimental in such matters. Thus, in spite of \"the prolifera tion of unsubstantiated evidence that permeates all four vers ions of Kammler's deat h, the shell of the case contains sufficient facts to suggest a more than coincidental pattern of seemingly targeted and organized disinformation.\" 17 The origin of this disinforma tion, according to Agoston, was probably within the SS itself, a program necessitated by Kammler's disappearance and likely treason to one of the victorious Allied powers. The \"first death of General Ha ns Kammler\" is recounted by Albert Speer himself, in his last book. In this most simple version, Kammler ordered his adjutant to shoot him. The \"suicide\" allegedly took place in Prague as Kammler realized the war was lost and, according to Speer, \"acted in elitist SS loyalty.\" 18 As Agoston quips, \"even the most ardent worshipper of Teutonic creed could 17 Agoston, op. cit., pp. 102-103, emphasis added. 18 Ibid., p. 103. 108"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"not possibly suggest that elitist SS l o y a l t y can be demonstrated three times, in three locatio ns, and all on the same day.\" 19 The second version of the story, rela ted to Agoston by Kammler's \"civilian\" ai de Dr. Wilhelm Voss, was that the general took cyanide somewhere \"on the road between Pilsen and Prague on May 9.\" 20 We will have more to say about Voss's association with Kammler's vast SS secret w eapons think tank in due course. The third version of Kammler's death was doled out by V-2 rocket expert, Genera l Walter Dornberger, subsequently employed by the American firm of Bell Aerospace. According to Dornberger, Kammler's mental and emotional st ate had quickly deteriorated in the final days of the war, an d the general overheard Kammler ordering his aide to shoot hi m if things became \"hopeless.\" 21 But this does not square with Do rnberger's close associate, Dr. Werner Von Braun's own reco llection of a conversation he overheard between Kammler and his aide Starck fully two weeks later. According to Von Braun, Kammler and Starck discussed the possibility of \"going underground \" before the Americans arrived, disguising themselves as monks in a nearby abbey. 22 Thus report, if true, is perhaps the most interesti ng, since it indicat es that Kammler had no intentions of surrendering himself to any of the Allied powers, but rather, intended to survive, perhap s independently continuing his oversight of secret weapons development. Another version of Kammler's d eath has him giving a speech to his assembled aides in Prague in early May 1945, dismissing them from their duties and advising them to return home, and then walking into a woods wher e he then shot himself. 23 And lastly, there is a version of Kammler's de ath that has him dying a typical SS hero's death, fighting and goi ng down in a blaze of \"glory\" in the face of rebelling and revolting Czechs. 24 19 Agoston, op. cit, p. 104. 20 Ibid. 21 Ibid., pp. 103-104. 22 Ibid. 23 Ibid., p. 99. 24 Ibid., p. 92. 109"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"What emerges from all this is that no one, no where can advance anything like a consistent account of the date, location, time, or even method of Kammle r's death.

Now he is in Prague, now he isn't; now he's with people, now he isn't; now he's suffering mental and emotional collapse, now he isn't. In all likelihood, ther efore, Kammler did no t die at all; he disappeared. The importa nt question is, where? C. The Ironic Death of General George S. Patton While Obergruppenfuhrer Kamm ler was busy dying four times in various locations by various means, another general was busy lunging his troops with the precision of a surgeon into the nerve centers of Kammler's black projects empire: General George S. Patton. His troops fo rmed the spearhead of the Allied lance that, much to the surprise of the Na zi, Soviet, a nd Allied field commanders themselves, suddenly tu rned from its victorious drive on Berlin to a militarily questionable operation designed to take the alleged \"Nazi redoubt.\" By the spring of 1945, the Redoubt had ballooned to become a major military concern to the Alli ed High command, \"despite the caveats from British and US military intelligence.\" 25 Agoston traces the origin of the \"redo ubt\" theme of the postwar Allied Legend to the USA's Office of St rategic Services, or OSS, the precursor to the modern day CI A. The OSS had apparently not bothered, according to Agoston, to check ou t the sources of its intelligence or the truthfulness of the \"redoubt.\" 26 The final decision to abandon Berlin as a military objective and drive south toward Thuringia was made by Eisenhower on April 11, 1945. 27 25 Agoston, op. cit., p. 22. 26 Ibid., p. 23. 27 Ibid., p. 23.

It could have been arranged by fellow SS General Wolff, already in negotiation with Allen 110"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The date of General Eisenhower's decision is crucial, for it means that the military objective sh ifted from Berlin toward south central Germany after the alleged atom bomb test at Ohrdruf on March 4, 1945. It is therefore possible that the OSS was in receipt of extremely secret intelligence concerning this weapons program and its centers of production, for Patton drives his troops with unerring accuracy right toward this super-secret installations, many of them underground and carefully camouflaged. Given the sensitivity of the Manhattan Proj ect within the structure of the Allied command, it is also plausible that the OSS decided not to share this information with the Supreme Allied Command, and proffered the \"Redoubt\" and \"fl eeing Nazis\" and a transferred German war archives as a cover story to sell the Allied command on a shitf of objectives away from Berlin. If indeed the OSS \"Redoubt\" reports were a component of an OSS psychological operation designed against the Allies' own military command structure, designed to divert Allied military operations to a gold mine of military technology and research, then one and only one general was in a position to know the real, and the whole story about the Redoubt, and what was actually recovered in Thuringia, Pilsen, and Prague, and that was General George S Patton. Patton, as his troops entered the Skoda works at Pilsen and the underground factorie s and laboratories at the Three Corners region in Thuringia would have been privy to the top secret reports of his divisional commanders entering these super-secret Reich facilities. Patton would thus have a thorough first hand knowledge of the complete inventor y of the Reich's most sensitive black programs. As Agoston himself notes, without seeming to realize the importance of his own observations in the light of post-war events, \"the sudden switch in Allied planning.... brought at least one Dulles, OSS station chief in Zurich. If so, then the sudden shift of Allied objectives to south central Germany may have originated from intelligence originating within the Kammlerstab itself. This intelligence would have been easily verifiable by Allies who would naturally have wanted to check its veracity by means of aerial reconnaissance of the installation sites presumably leaked to them by someone in the Kammlerstab. 1ll"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"bonanza. The rapid eastward drive of the US Third Army brought to Kammler's secret metropolis well ahead of the Russians in whose designated zone it lay.\" 28 The holy grail of all this research were the files and blueprints in the central coordination office of Kammler's black programs think ta nk inside the Skoda Works at Pilsen. And it is likely that General Patton therefore knew much of the general outlines of this treasure trove and what it portended for future secret weapons development. There is thus a direct and immediate link between General Ge orge S. Patton, General Hans Kammler, and the little-known wo rld of top secret weapons research that Kammler headed. 29 And this in turn may lend so me credence to those who view General Patton's ironic death af ter the war as being something more than an ironic accident. The factual circumstances of Patton's death are plain enough. While on an inspection tour with his driver and Major General Hobart Gray on December 9, 1945, Patton's car swerved to avoid hitting a heavy US Army transport truck that had turned in front of th em. Patton's driver, attention momentarily diverted away from the road by a remark that Patton himself had made, belatedly noticed the truck in front of them, and swerved the General's car to avoid a head-on collision. None of the others involved in the accident were hurt, and all were able to walk away from the accident. Not so General Patton. He had suffered a broken neck, and the prognosi s was paralysis from the neck down. From this point the General recovered rapidly at the military hospital in Frankfurt, making such good progress that until the afternoon of D ecember 19th, his doctors were seriously considering moving him to Boston. But that afternoon his breathing difficulties increased dramatica lly and suddenly. On December 20th he suffered breathlessness and pallor, and Patton, who had had a prior history of em bolism, died in his sleep on December 21st at 5:50 P.M. 30 28 Agoston, op. cit., p. 27. 29 This fact is adequately appreciated by Mayer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis, p. 156. 30 Ladislas Farago, Patton: Ordeal and Triumph, pp. 787-794. 112"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The fact that Patton alone of all the victims of the automobile accident suffered serious injuries, plus the lact of his recovery and then sudden decline in a military hospital, have fueled various conspiracy theories.

Another version is similar, but has the OSS or other Allied entity performi ng the 'accid ent\" and subsequent \"medical complications.\" If there is any truth in the idea of a conspiracy behind the ironic death of America's most decorate d and celebrated general officer of the Second World War, then the expl anation is likely to lie in the more esoteric and arcane secret s he and his intelligence officers uncovered in Thuringia and at th e Skoda Works in Pilsen. Having performed a preliminary assess ment of the second and third generation weaponry Kammler's scientists had begun to research, the OSS specialists who arrived at these sites must have i m m e d i a tely realized the material would require the tightest security and highest classification then possible, beyond that even of the Manhattan Project, not least because what was uncovered would give lie to the emerging Allied Legend of nuclear technological superiority.

British Lieute nant Colonel James Brierley, commanding the first British intelligence group to arrive in Pilsen after its capture, stated that th e Skoda plant workers and engineers themselves reported that everyt hing was microfilmed, that the buildings which housed their blueprints and development projects had been demolished, and also that the files had been stored outside Pilsen. 34 Destroyed by whom? And stored outside Pilsen by whom? Presumably by the SS itself. It is perhaps pertinent to this idea that many of the reports of Kammler's death place him in the area, not to die, but to remove the most sensitive data and to vouchsafe it for security. At this point it is necessary to say something about Agoston's own thesis concerning the disappearance of the Kammler Staff's files. The whole thesis of Agost on's book is obvious from its title, i.e., that in the confus ion of the transfer of the Skoda Works from American to Russian military occupation, the Kammler Group's entire secret invent ory was handed over to the Soviet Union.

Wilcox, Japan's Secret War. An ancient Japanese legend has it that the Japanese people are descended from a blonde haired blue eyed race that came from the stars, a legend remarkably similar to the doctrines that percolated in the secret societies that fostered and mid-wifed the Nazi Party into existence in Germany between the World Wars. Nor did this legend play a small part in the history of World War Two, for it was partly because of its mere existence that Hitler could proclaim the Japanese \"honorary Aryans\" and conclude the incorporation of Japan into the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis without contradicting Nazi Party racial ideology. This was in no small part due to the Japanese ambassador in Berlin's diploma tic skill in pointing out this little known fact of Japanese legends to the Germans. Of course, there were pressing military and political reasons for Italy and Germany to conclude an alliance with Ja pan, but for the race and ideology obsessed Nazi government, so much the better if the Japanese had some sort of Nordic-Aryan conn ection, no matter how tenuous that might be. An early and continuous problem for the three Axis partners was to arrange the transfer of technology and raw materials from Europe to the Far East. Most tr ansfers occurred via U-boats or Japanese submarines, though both Germany and Italy undertook 1 Robert K.

The Italians, for example, mounted such a flight with a Savoia Marchetti S 75 GA during 1942, ostensibly fo r the purpose of supplying the Italian embassy in Tokyo with copi es of new Italia n code books, since the Commando Supremo had concluded that the Allies had broken Italian codes. 3 As the war progressed, the Germans found themselves increasingly trading their high technology for very little in return other than the prospect of stiffening Japanese resistance and perhaps drawing American forc e to the Pacific and lessening pressure on the Reich. And the Japanese, their industry hard- pressed to maintain pace with American and British technological developments, were always very eag er, and very specific, in their demands for high technology fr om their Aryan brethren. Even the conv entional military techno logy transf ers form Germany to Japan are staggeri ng enough. By 1944 Japan had requested and received either working models or full production designs for the following: • German techniques for manuf acturing cartridge steel for large gun barrel linings; • Finished artillery pieces; • 105 and 128 mm heavy anti- aircraft (FLAK) guns; • the 75 and 88 mm field pieces and anti-tank guns; • the Wurzburg radar system; • 750 ton submarine pressure hulls; • the PzKw Via Tiger I tank; • The Focke Wulfe 190 fighter; • The Henschel 129 tank-busting aircraft; 4 3 Dr. Publio Magini, Military History Quarterly, Summer 1993. I am very grateful to Frank Joseph for uncovering and sharing this information with me. The updating of Italian code books would be a pressing enough matter for the Italians to undertake such a flight. 4 This rather odd-looking twin engine aircraft had a bulbous cupola slung beneath the nose of the main fuselage, in which was mounted a 75mm automatically reloading high velocity anti-tank gun projecting from its nose. It was a deadly and efficient tank-busting ai rplane used with great effectiveness on the Eastern Front, curiously resembling a similar ground assault aircraft in the modern American arsenal, the A-10 \"Warthog.\" 118"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"• T he Heinkcl He 177 heavy bomber; • T he Messcrschmitt 264 long-range Amerikabomber; • T he Messerschmitt 262 jet fighter; • The Messerschmitt 163 rocket-powered fighter; • The Lorenz 7H2 bombsight; • The B/3 and FUG 10 ai rborne radars; and perhaps significantly, • Twenty-five pounds of \"bomb fuses.\" 5 Fortunately for American and Comm onwealth forces in the Pacific theater, these weapons never sa w full scale production by the Japanese. What is intriguing is the last item. Why bomb fuses? Surely the Japanese, who had been raining bombs all over China, Indochina, Burma, and the Pacific knew how to fuse a conventional bomb.

Strange Rumors As with the end of the war in Europe, the end of the Pacific war carried with it the odd rumor or two, some of which managed to appear in short articles in the Western Press, before the curtain of the Allied Legend slammed down to hide their implications from view. Robert K. Wilcox, in a book that may well in retrospect be the first book on the German bom b project from a revisionist perspective, Japan's Secret War, revitali zed these reports and rumors: Shortly after World War II had ended, American intelligence in the Pacific received a shocking report: The Japanese, just prior to their surrender, had developed and successfully test-fired an atomic bomb. The project had been housed in or near Konan (Japanese name for Hungnam), Korea, in the peninsula's North. The war had ended before 5 Joseph Mark Scalia, Germany's Last Mission to Japan: The Failed Voyage of the U-234, pp. 7-9. 119"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"this weapon could be used, and the plant where it had been made was now in Russian hands. By the summer of 1946 the report was public. David Snell, an agent with the Twenty-fourth Criminal Investigation Detachment in Korea... wrote about it in the Atlanta Constitution following his discharge. 6 Snell's source for the allegation was a Japanese officer returning to Japan. The officer informed him that he had been in charge of security for the project. Snell, para phrasing the officer in his article, stated: In a cave in a mountain near Konan men worked, racing against time, in final assembly of \"genzai bakudan,\" Japan's name for the atomic bomb. It was August 10, 1945 (Japanese time), only four days after an atomic bomb flashed in the sky over Hiroshima and five days before Japan surrendered. To the north, Russian hordes were spilling into Manchuria. Shortly after midnight of that day, a convoy of Japanese trucks moved from the mouth of the cave, past watchful sentries. The trucks wound through valleys, past sleeping form villages.... In the cool predawn, Japanese scientists and engineers loaded genzai bakudan aboard a ship at Konan. Off the coast, near an islet in the se a of Japan, more frantic preparations were under way. All that day and night, ancient ships, junks and fishing vessels moved into the anchorage. Before dawn on August 12, a robot launch chugged through the ships at anchor and beached itself on the islet. Its passenger was genzai bakudan. A clock ticked. The observers were 20 miles away. The waiting was difficult and strange to men who had worked relentlessly so long, who knew their job had been completed too late. The light in the east, where Japan lay, grew brighter. The moment the sun peeped over the sea there was a burst of light at the anchorage, blinding the observers, who wore welder's glasses. The ball of fire was estimated to be 1,000 yards in diameter. A multicolored cloud of vapors boiled toward the heavens, then mushroomed in the atmosphere. The churn of water and vapor obscured the vessels directly under the burst.

How had Japan, hard-pressed for even conventional military technology, pulled off this feat of te sting an atom bomb of the same approximate yield as Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Where did they get the enriched uranium for the wea pon? Moreover, the Japanese had tested their bomb only three days after the plutonium \"Fat Man\" fell on and obliterated Nagasaki. Small wonder then, that the Japanese cabinet debated whether or not to surrender. This important fact, in conjunction with Wilcox's startlin g revelations, will serve as the basis for further speculation in a moment. Finally, the test itself suggested that the Japanese en visioned deploying the weapon against naval targets. What possi ble thoughts may have been going through the Japanese cabinet's surr ender debate? Poss ible clues lie in the nature of the Japanese program itself, and its significant reliance on technology transfers from Germany. The chief physicist involved in the Japanese project was Yoshio Nishina, a \"colleague of Niels Bohr.\" 8 It was Nishina who in fact headed the Japanese army team th at investigated Hiroshima after the bombing of that city. 9 The reports of the Japanese test at Konan were a steady source of conste rnation and mystification to American intelligence units in oc cupied Japan after the war, for unlike its obsession with the German bomb program, Allied intelligence consistently placed the Japanese far behind, as conducting only theoretical studies, and maintaining that the Japanese \"had neither the talent nor the resources to make a bomb.\" 10 Resources Japan may have lacked, but there was no lack 7 Wilcox, op. cit., p. 16. 8 Ibid., p. 17, referencing an article in the January 1978 edition of Science magazine. 9 Ibid. 10 Ibid. 121"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"of talented physicists who understood bomb physics. In any case the reports caused enough concern tor the American occupying forces to send several intellig ence teams throughout Japan to destroy its cyclotrons, of which there were no less than five, and presumably more! 11 This curious fact raises a question. What were the Japanese doing with that ma ny cyclotrons? Could they have perhaps been given the secrets of Baron Manfred Von Ardenne's method of mass spectrograph separa tion and enrichment of uranium 235? Or did the Japanese physic ists, like their German and American counterparts, come to th e realization that the cyclotron afforded a method for isotope enri chment? Both are possible, and the latter is probable. B. Strange Industrial Complexe s: Kammler Revisited, Noguchi Style Further confirmation of a Japane se atom bomb test led Wilcox to connect Nishina to a Japane se industrialist named Noguchi. Searching through American declas sified records, Wilcox quickly concluded that \"subsequent directives in the same boxes ordered reinvestigations in 1947 and 1948 of Japanese wartime atomic research, indicating that (American intelligence) still did not know exactly what had happened. In fa ct, (it) was continually ordering reinvestigations of Japanese wartime atomic research and discovering new facts at least up until 1949, according to additional documents that I found.\" 12 Then Wilcox struck a very rich vein: Box 3 of Entry 224 yielded a high mark of my two days at Suitland: 13 an interrogation of a former engineer at the Noguchi Konan complex, Otogoro Natsume, conducted on October 31, 1946. \"Subject\" of the interrogation was listed as \"Further questioning the newspaper story about atomic bomb explosion in Korea.\" In attendance were head(sic) of the Science and Technology Division, Dr. Harry Kelly; an interpreter, \"T/4 Matsuda,\" and a \"Mr. Donnelly,\" identified only as \"5259 TIC.\" He apparently was some 11 Wilcox, op. cit., pp. 17, 192. 12 Ibid., p. 222. 13 \"Suitland\" is Wilcox's nickname for the US National Archives. 122"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"sort of intelligence officer and, judging from their questions, the interrogators had more informat ion about the Konan-Hungnam story tha n was in the newspaper. Natsume, a chemical engineer, according to the interrogation, had been imprisoned by the Russians and then released to run a Konan plant until he escaped \"on a small sailing boat\" in December 1945. He told the investigators he'd heard the rumors about the atomic bomb explosion at Konan but knew nothing about it. According to the transcript, the following exchange then ensued: Kelly: \"Did any of the plants have accidents during the war?\" Donnelly: \"We haven't actually found anything concrete. Last few days we have been talking with people here in and around Tokyo and asking them about report(s) of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and asking them if they knew about it or which plant it was.\" Kelly: \"Did any of the plants have accidents during the war?\" (Natsume through Matsuda): \"There were none.\" Donnelly: \"Ask him if he knows anything about the NZ plant making hydrogen peroxide.\" Matsuda: \"He says that he heard about the factory but it was under the Navy and highly secret.

Do you mean University Graduate?\" Kelly: \"yes.\" Matsuda: \"He says that there are two factories under management of this company - one in Konan a nd one in Honbu. There are about 700 chemists altogether (approximately 300 at Konan).\" In a lengthy exchange, Natsume indicated that most of the scientists, engineers, and workers at Konan were arrested and then later released to go back to work. But six key technical people from NZ, whom he later named, were not released and he had \"no idea\" what the Russians were doing with them except they were being held in the \"secret plant.\" Kelly: \"Has he got any idea as to how we can get these secret plans?\" 123"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Matsuda: \"The s ix men mentioned are the only ones who knew much about the secret plant.\" 14 As we shall see momentarily, perh aps the most significant thing about this interrogation is the date, October 31, 1946 . It is also significant that the bulk of the scie ntists involved appear to have been chemists. Finally, as is apparent from the interrogation, the plant or plants at Konan were of significant size. So what was the Konan complex? To reconstruct it requires a similar process to that used in examining the German uranium enrichment program. The transcript connects the Konan complex and a Japanese industrialist named Noguchi. Jun Noguchi had built the huge Japanese complex of factories that nestled abou t the Yalu, Chosin, and Fu sen rivers. The latter two rivers had been dammed by N oguchi to supply the enormous electrical power needed by his fact ories. \"Together the three rivers delivered more than 1 million kilowatts of power\" to the complex. 15 This was for the time a prodigious amount of electr icity, especially in view of the fact that all of Japan produced no more than 3 million. 16 Begun in 1926 in a deal stru ck with the Japanese Army Noguchi's Konan empire expanded along with Japan's imperial appetites. So, like the I.G. Farben \"Buna \" plant at Auschwitz, we note already two key ingredients are pres ent at Konan: large electrical power production infrastructure, and proximity to large amounts of water. Konan, in fact, was the largest industrial complex in all of Asia, and relatively sh eltered and even unknow n to Allied bomber and the intelligence committees that prepared their targets lists. 17 But there is more. Declassified documents noted that Konan was also near uranium ore deposits. \"This was the logical place for an end-of-the- war atomic bomb project.\" 18 Moreover, as Wilcox discovered, 1 4 Wilcox, op. cit, pp. 222-224. 1 5 Wilcox, op. cit., p.63. 1 6 Ibid. 1 7 Ibid., p. 27. 1 8 Ibid. 124"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"\"More digging...turned up a le ngthier summary.\" Dated May 21, 1946 and originating within the US Army's chief of staff office in South Korea, it stated: Of increasing interest have been recent reports dealing with an apparent undercover research laboratory operated by the Japanese ... at ...

It is felt that a great deal of credence should be attached to these reports as summarized. 19 We may now speculate as to the real significance of these US Army intelligence reports in the light of subsequent events. Clearly, the US Army is taking seriously allegations of a Japanese atom bomb project ba sed in the nort hern Korean Peninsula, very close in fact, to the international border with China, and scene of one of the Korean War's bloodiest battles. At the Chosin Reservoir, General of th e Armies Douglas MacArthur had been dealt a significant defeat and was forced to retreat. Indeed, after his celebrated landing at In chon, MacArthur had relentlessly driven his troops northward in a classic blitzkrieg style campaign, designed in part to seize the Ya lu River crossings, crucial to any further operations in China, as well as for defe nse against any Chinese invasion of the peninsula. And the Chosin Reservoir, and hence Noguchi's vast Konan comp lex, was also a prime military target. With MacArthur's insu bordination and the subsequent 19 Wilcox, op. cit, p. 28. 125"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Chinese entry into the war, Truman fired MacArthur. So goes the standard history. But could the real motivations for MacArthur's lightening dash up the peninsula toward Chosin alter the Inchon landings in fact have been based on a very differ ent, and highly secret, agenda of military objectives? Given the US Army's own intelligence memoranda concerning the Konan complex and Russian activities it seems all too likel y. And this in turn may mean that the real motivations for his subsequent fi ring by Truman may also lie in what he uncovered there: ce rtain knowledge of the extent, capabilities, and actual achievements of the Japanese scientists and engineers working on the genzai bakudan. But what would have been so sensitive about the Japanese atom bomb project, beyond its actual achievements? To answer this question, we must speculate once again. What isotope separation and enrichment methods were known to the Japanese? What did physicist Nishina and his team of scientists fina lly rely on? Like them German counterparts, the Japanese knew that the ultra-centrifuge was the simplest path, at least in theory, toward the uranium bomb. But Japanese scientists calculated the needed revolutions-per- minute of such a device to be between 100,000 and 150,000 rpms. The United States itself, becaus e of the difficulties in designing turbines of this speed, decide d to forego enrichment via this process. 20 At this point, Wilcox's reconstruction begins to run into a bit of trouble, for the Japanese, he re ports, were able to design, and apparently to build, a large ultra-centrifuge. 21 Their only problem, according to Wilcox, was a large enough supply or uranium. However, there is a significant w eakness in this construction, for the Japanese, it will be recalled, ha d to request German assistance in the design and produc tion of jet engines, a request that led not only to the exchange of blueprin ts for the Messer schmitt 262, the world's first operational jet fighter, but of technicians able to show the Japanese the nece ssary production methods and tolerances to construct such high speed turbin es operating under the stress of 20 Wilcox, op. cit, p. 119. 2 1 Ibid., p. 120. 126"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"tremendous heat. In other words, while Japanese theoretical capabilities were not lacking at that time, they did lack certain industrial expertise which only the Germans possessed. Moreover, as we have already seen, the centrifuge idea had originated and b e e n d e v e loped by the Germans. So if the Japanese successfully designed and built a large ultra-centrifuge, it would seem likely that German assistance was invo lved at some point. The other method, a cheaper method and certainly one well within Japanese wartime industrial capability, and one taken to extremely large size by them, was very much a German device. What the Nishina group finally did settle on was a process called thermal diffusion. This had been one of the first isotope separation processes devised. But until it was perfected by two German scientists, Klaus Clusius and Gerhard Dickel, in 1938, it had not been practical. Stated simply, thermal diffusion relied on the fact that light gas moves toward heat. Clusius and Dickel c onstructed a simple device consisting chiefly of two metal tubes placed on inside the other. The inner tube was heated; the outer one was cooled . When the apparatus was turned on, the lighter U-235 moved to the he at wall; the U-238, to the cold wall. Convex currents created by this movement sent the U235 upward; the U-238 downward.... At a certain point the U-235 at the top could be collected, and new ga s pumped in. it was a simple and rapid way to get relatively large concentrations of U-235. 22 As Wilcox notes, this process, developed as it was in Germany, gave the Japanese access to the la test development of this simple and unusual technology. And as we ha ve already seen, the Germans also deliberately fabricated an al loy - Bondur - to offset the highly corrosive effects of uranium gas. Used in large size and enough quantity - At Auschwitz and Konan - and perhaps in conjunc tion with other technologies of enrichment, Von Ardenne's mass spectrograph adaptations of cyclotrons, it is entirely feasible that the Japanese also had a highly s e c r e t uranium enrichment project being run near the Konan complex. So one may advance the line of speculation further: with the surrender of the U-234 and its cargo of infrared proximity fuses and 22 Wilcox, op. cit, p. 95. 127"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"their inventor, Heinz Schlicke, and Japan's own request for \"fuses\" and plans for German strategic heavy bombers, MacArthur's troops at the Chosin Reservoir may have uncovered not only evidence of Japanese progress and eventual te sting of a uranium atomic bomb but they may have uncovered further evidence of the success of the program that lay behind it: Nazi Germany's. I ndeed, the fuses point to a possible plutonium bomb project underway in both countries. And so we return to the decision of the Ja panese cabinet, and speculate further. If the Japanese government knew of the German program, they may also have known of the extent of its success Two bombs had fallen, a nd according to the translator for Marshal Rodion Malinovsky, another had fallen but not detonated. In any case, the Japanese were probably aware that while America's single bomb project may not have been capable of delivering more bombs within a short span of time, th ere would have been no way to estimate how many bombs might have been taken as war booty from the Germans. And the failure of the U-234's mission would have told them that at the mini mum, fuses capable of use in a plutonium bomb as well as a larg e supply of enriched uranium had fallen into Allie d hands. By August 12, 19 45, with the successful test of the Japanese bomb and the German test of October 1944. the war had gone nuclear. Thus, if the Japanese had been informed of the successful test of the German atom bomb in October of 1944, then the debate of the Imperial Cabinet in Tokyo is understandable. Japan was faced with a potential rain of atom bombs \"of German provenance,\" to quote Oppenheimer's curious remark on ce again. Surrender, ganzai bakudan notwithstanding, was the l ogical choice, even for a nation steeped in \"proud samurai traditions of honor.\" Perhaps it is significant, in the light of contemporary problems with a nuclear North Korea, that the Japanese government issued a strong warning to North Korea that it could arm itself to the teeth with nuclear and thermonuclear w eapons in a heartbeat, and would not hesitate to do so if threatened. In this light, perhaps the most significant fact uncovered by Wilcox is that \"contrary to the conventional military history that Japanese atomic efforts were bombed into exti nction by spring 128"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"1945... the project was continued and heightened even after the Emperor's August 15 surrender.\" 23 Wilcox does not elaborate much farther than this, but the st atement raises a chilling prospect: How could a Japanese project surv ive right under the noses of the occupying American forces? ... and what if it was not only the Japanese project that survived?

T HE H EERESWAFFENAMT AND H OUTERMANS M EMORANDA \"And there is something else interesting: Erwin K. Oppenheimer maintained that the bomb that was dropped on Japan was of German provenance. \" Edgar Mayer and Thomas Mehner, Das Geheimnis der deutschen Atombombe 1 One of the most problematical documents to explain from the standpoint of the postwar Allied Legend is the top secret memorandum concerning the de velopment of an atom bomb anonymously submitted to the Ge rman Army Ordnance Bureau (Heereswaffenamt) in early 1942. Th is document not only correctly estimated the critical mass for a uranium-235 based bomb, but also indicated the possibility of transm utation of uraniu m into plutonium - called \"Element 94\" by the memo randum - and its use in a bomb. The memorandum's origin and author ship has been attributed to various interred Farm hall scientists, including Dr. Kurt Diebner. But the authorship is unknown, and the problem of its existence remains: How could th e German army, knowi ng that the required amount of uranium for a nuclear bomb was comparatively small and therefore technically feasible, not have pursued its development? And how could they have pursued such laughably pathetic attempts toward a functioning reactor? The mystery only deepens when we consider a possible ancestry for the Heereswaffenamt memo written in a paper the previous year. In 1941, Baron Manfred Von Ardenne decided to circulate an unusual paper by his colleague Dr. Fritz Houtermans. The full title of the paper was \"On the Question of the Release of Nuclear chain 1 Edgar Mayer and Thomas Mehner, Das Geheimnis der deutschen Atombombe: Gewann Hitlers Wissenschaftler den nuklearen Wettlauf doch?

The Importance of a Chain Reaction at Low Temperatures as a Neutron Source as an Apparatus for Isotope Transformation 3 The general outline suggests that Houtermans had already thought his way through the process, not only of initiating nuclear explosions via fast neutrons, but also of the transformation of U 235 into higher elements not chemical identifiable with it. This is the first step toward plutonium, and to the use of plutonium rather than U 235 as the explosive fuel for a bomb. The contents of the paper confirms that this is what Houtermans has figured out in no uncertain terms: We are able to envision here an apparatus, that would allow...a certain amount of U 235 to undergo nuclear reaction, simultaneously as an isotope transforming apparatus. The advantage vis-a-vis an isotope enrichment apparatus is therefore that the newly-created product, which would have an atomic number of 93 or more, is not chemically identical with uranium, and ther efore is separable by chemical methods. Now since much larger amounts, namely 139 times more, of 2 Thomas Powers, Heisenberg's War, p. 112.

He may therefore also be considered a leading candidate, if not the leading candidate, for the au thorship of the anonymous Heereswaffenamt memorandum. Hi s Jewish background would explain why the memorandum was authored anonymously. So, having speculated in previous pages that Nazi Germany had actually pursued a uranium bomb as the primary co mponent of its bomb, and conducted a large and ve ry secret uranium enrichment project in order to acquire it, we now come to the subject of the possibility of a plutoni um bomb project, condu cted once again in secret, and far from the \"public ex posure\" laboratory tinkering of the Farm Hall scientists . In this respect ther e has already been one indication: the allegation of a s econd nuclear test of a bomb wilh a very small critical mass via the pr ocess of boosted fission, near the Three Corners region of Thuringi a, an area that has the highest gamma background radiation in all of Germany. Are there corroborating indications that the Germans might have successfully de veloped an atomic re actor, and hence, plutonium, in the secret recesses of Kammler's SS black programs secret weapons empire? Henry Pi cker, in his book Hitler's Table Talk, makes one signific ant statement. Not only does he indicate that the Reichspost had someth ing to do with the atom bomb project, but he offers more deta il. The bomb was to be constructed in a plant \"in an underground SS factory in the southern Harz mountains, which had a foreseen production capacity of 30,000 4 Mayer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis, p. 32. 132"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"workers.\" 5 Once again, the trail leads b ack to the SS, the southern Harz mountains of Thuringia, and large underground factories. This facility, according to Picker , \"was transferred back to the USSR by the Red Army\" afte r the German surrender. 6 According to Picker, it was for this reason that Stalin reacted with such detachment when President Truman informed him of the successful test of the plutonium bomb at th e Trinity site in New Mexico, for Stalin had already acquired the ne cessary technology to make his own atom bomb. Moreover, Stalin awarded Manfred Von Ardenne the \"Soviet 'Nobel Prize,' the Stalin Prize.\" 7 Mayer and Mehner comment on the real significance of this series of admissions: Everything clear? The Russians thus came into possession of some means of production - which from then until now remains unknown - and paid off Manfred Von Ardenne, who was certainly the best consultant in these things, who must have clarified for them the things the Russians had found there. 8 It is an intriguing idea, for we have already discovered a possible plutonium bomb detonation near Ohrdruf very late in the war. 9 This would of necessity imply that the Germans had acquired a successful atomic reactor, the ques tion is, where? In any case, the reason for lack of knowledge about this project is clear: it was in the control of the SS, and therefor e, within the po rtfolio of the security-obsessed General Kammler. In any case, Houter mans' reactor concept was significantly different than Heisenberg's, or for that matter, even Enrico Fermi's successful atomic pile at the University of Chicago, 5 Henry Picker, Hitler's Tischgespr achen im Fuhrerhauptquartier, 2 Auflage (Berlin: Propylaen taschenbuch bei Ullstein, 1997), cited in Mayer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis, p. 34. 6 Ibid. 7 Mayer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis, p. 34, citing Picker. 8 ibid. 9 Uranium could of course have been used in a boosted fission device, but the process works better with plutonium, and plutonium would more likely account for such a small critical mass as was reported, namely, 100 grams, since more than that would have been necessary for a uranium bomb even with boosted fission. 133"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"since it aimed at the production no t of energy, but of radioactive isotopes. For this reason, it would be able to operate at low temperature using liquid methane as a moderator, rather than heavy water or graphite. This meant that it would be an efficient producer of \"element 93 or higher\" that could be chemically separated and used as a nuclear explosive. 10 This is significant, for it differentiates the Von Ardenne- Houtermans effort both from the He isenberg effort to design and construct a working atomic pile, and from Enrico Fermi's success in doing so. 11 So at one end of the war, ca. 1945, we find the allegations on tested weapon of small critical mass which, if true, is most liked that of a plutonium bomb using a pr ocess of boosted fission, and at the other end, ca. 1941, we have a paper outlining a project to achieve a reactor for the production of the explosive fuel of such a bomb. There is an odd piece of corr oboration that the Germans may also have been perilously close to, if not in actual possession of, a plutonium atom bomb, from the Pa cific Theater and the Japanese program. Robert Wilcox, in his Ja pan's Secret War, recounts how the Spanish Nationalist government successfully ran a spy ring both for the Germans and for the Japane se, an espionage operation that had no little success in penetrating the Manha ttan Project, even to the extent of acquiring in 1943 th e earliest Allied designs for a detonator for such a bomb. Inte rviewing Angel Alcazar de Velasco, the alleged head of the ring, W ilcox quotes a rather astonishing statement: The information was that the American work on a nuclear weapon was very advanced but they had a long way to go. There were even notes 1 0 Rose, op. cit, p. 141. 1 1 Researcher Frank Joseph has found another source for a reactor, and consider his information to be so crucial to this story, and so sensational, that cannot in good conscience mention it in this work. I believe that it is a story that he best tells himself, since it is his discovery. He was kind enough to share it with me as this book was being written. 134"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"about the detonator. It was similar to one already in use by the Germans. 12 A complicated detonator - presumably for use in a plutonium bomb, since the detonator mechanism for a uranium bomb is a much simpler piece of equipment - already in use by the Germans in 1943!? Why would the Germans have had the need for such a complex detonator? The timing of the allegation is also disturbing, since it corroborates the assertions, examined earlier, of the Japanese military attache in St ockholm, that the Germans were using some type of weapon of mass destruction on the Eastern Front ca. 1943, in the region of Kursk. 13 But Houtermans was interested in more than just atom bombs. Even Paul Lawrence Rose admits that Houtermans' role in Nazi atom bomb research \"remains enigmatic.\" 14 The reason why, though, is clear enough, once its enormous implications are understood, for Houtermans' real specialty lay in the first theoretical descripti on of the process of thermonuclear fusion of heavy hydrogen (deuterium and tritium) atoms through high heat in stars, the very heat produced by an uncontr olled chain reaction. 15 With this, we are a step closer to unlocking the riddle of just exactly what types of weapons Kammler's \"think tank\" was working on, for if Hotelmans' id ea was seized u pon, then hydrogen bombs would have been the next logical progression in the 12 Wilcox, op. cit, p. 28, emphasis added. 13 The attache, it will be recalled, actua lly maintained that these weapons - whatever they were - were also used in the \"Crimea\", making it most likely during the siege of the Russian fortress of Sevastopol in 1942. Thus would seem to weigh very heavily against this mystery weapon being an atom bomb. But if not, what other weapon could have caused such destruction? This is a question that will be more fully addre ssed in subsequent parts of this book. Powers notes that Allen Dulles in Zurich received reports of a German project in \"vast underground factories\" that were after \"putting out a new explosive in aerial bombs. He has even heard that the container of the explosive is spherical.\" (Rose, op. cit., p. 272, empha sis added) A spherical detonator, of course, is the type of implosion-compression detonator used to assemble the critical mass of a plutonium bomb. 14 Rose, op. cit., p. 51, n. 38. 15 Q.v.

Is there any indication the this was in fact the real ultimate goal of the secret German SS atom bomb program? In other words, was it really an atom bomb program at all? Or was it a hydrogen bomb program? Fantastic as it may be to believ e, the latter possibility would seem to be the actual case. The le tter of Professor Lachner referred to previously also gives furt her illumination on the goal of Kammler's SS Sonderkommando: Work was also conducted on the hydrogen bomb. A factory for the manufacture of heavy hydrogen was constructed in Norway but was of course destroyed by the enemy. The small uranium bombs were primarily intended as detonators for the hydrogen bombs, so their immediate use was not contemplated. 16 Another corroborati on for this astonishing assertion may be found in a pre-war Austrian patent for a \"molecular bomb\", an early version of the hydrogen bomb, from 1938. 17 In any case, Professor Lachner asserts unequivocally that the real goal of the project was weapon more terrifying and dest ructive than the atom bomb. Another factor is worth mentioni ng in this regard. The pursuit of the hydrogen bomb would al so explain why the Nazis were interested in small at om bombs, made smalle r via boosted fission, for a hydrogen bomb, at least with the technology available back then, would have been an enor mously heavy and cumbersome object. The quest for \"miniaturi zation\" was therefore another practical aim: any such bomb woul d have to be made small enough for German bombers or rockets to carry, and even then, only the very largest bombers or rockets would have b een up to th e task, if at all. 18 1 6 Mayer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis, p. 80. 1 7 Ibid., pp. 255-256. 1 8 It should be recalled that the first hydrogen bomb, America's \"Mike\", weighed several tons, and was impractical as an actual weapon. America's first operational hydrogen bomb actually weighed several tons. It is difficult to imagine any existing aircraft in the Germ an arsenal, not even the enormous Ju 390, as being up to the task of delivering a hydrogen bomb, and the specifications for the A9/10 Amerikarak et are far below what would be needed 136"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"But to produce hydrogen bombs, one must have an adequate supply of the heavy hydrogen isot opes deuterium a nd tritium. Here again, however, the Allied Legend intervenes, and maintains that after the successful Allied destru ction of the Norwegian heavy water plant at Ryukon, German production of the precious destructive substance was never able to recover, and, as a consequence, heavy water for a moderator in reactors (much less a hydrogen bomb!) was never in enough su pply. The further implication of this assertion is, of course, that the failure of Heisenberg and other scientists to construct a reactor based on heavy water as a moderator was d oomed to failure because of the lack of supply. But again, the realit y was quite different . Dr. Diebner in an exchange with Dr. Wirtz - both later interred at Farm Hall - indicated that a complete heavy water plant was built in Germany by the end of 1943. 19 However, revelations ma de at the end of the war were even more important as a means of measuring the truly significant extent of German heav y water production: a large heavy water factory, hitherto entirely unknown, had been discovered by the Allies in Kiel in northern Ge rmany. But most importantly, after the German reunification in 1989, when the vast SS underground factories in the Harz region of Th uringia in the former eastern zone were rediscovered, many of these were found to contain several large electrical genera tors, enough to supply power for a few small cities!20 Such high electrical output would certainly not have been needed for the last Fuhrer Headquarters, but it certainly would have been required for factories separa ting uranium isotope(especially if they used Von Ardenne's cy clotron process) , and that manufactured heavy water. Was th e hydrogen bomb the real goal? Does this explain the reason that , if Germany did have the atom for such a bomb. The only practical method of delivering a hydrogen bomb, it seems to me, would have been via a large submarine or ship to a port city, a militarily quite risky venture, and one that, for the German crews involved, would have been a one way venture. 1 9 Mayer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis, p. 197. 20 Ibid., p. 198. 137"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"bomb, it (or they) were seldom if ever actually used, being husbanded as detonators for something lar more powerful?

In view of the thesis that has been examined througho ut the previous pages, the Farm Hall tr anscripts also reveal an equal schizophrenic on the part of commentators ever since their decla ssification in the early 1990s by the British govern ment. Consider for example the following remark by Je remy Bernstein with regard to Samuel Goudsmit's \"ALSOS\" mission to Germany at the end of the was \"As the mission progre ssed, and the Alsos team learned more and more about the paucity of the German program, the concern focused on not letting the Russians ge t at the Germans and so glean 'any major bomb secrets.'\" 2 If the German bomb program was in a state characterized as \"paucity,\" and if there we re fundamental \"problems\" in Heisenberg's u nderstanding of nuclear fission and bomb physics - as there indeed were - then why the concern at a l l ? But then early on in the tr anscripts an exchange betwen Heisenberg, Diebner, and Korsch ing occurs, in which the three German scientists disc uss the possibility that they may have been viewed by the Allies and Sovi ets at Potsdam as war booty. 1 David Cassidy, \"Introduction,\" in Jeremy Bernstein, ed., Hitler's Uranium Club: The Secret Recordings at Farm Hall, Second Edition, (new York: Copernicus, 2001), p. xxix. 2 Bernstein, op. cit, p. 47. 140"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Barnstein then comments \"presuma bly Heisenberg is worried here about being taken to task in Ge rman for failing to build a bomb.

Clearly it woul d seem that something more is going on at Farm Hall that either el udes commentators, or that they are simply ignoring. The conversations proceeds among the ten scientists, with one concern (prior to the ann ouncement of th e a-bombing of Hiroshima) being how to contin ue with their \"work\", totally oblivious to the fact that others had indeed carried on their \"work\" to brilliant conclusion. 4 The schizophrenia grows whenever the subject of isotope separation co mes up in conversation. In the epigraph that began this chapter, reference is made to the Clusius tube \"thermal diffusion\" method perfected by Clusius and Dickel: \"Bagge in Berlin and Clusius a nd Dickel in Munich developed isotope separation methods but ac hieved little practical success. They never obtained enough U 235 to make the proper measurements and certainly too little for a bomb.\" 5 However, in the transcripts themselves, Heisenberg remarks that one reason he and his fellow scientists were interred was that the Allies did not \"want us to pass on our knowledge to other people.\" 6 However it is the editorial comment of this remark that rea lly intrigues; the Germans, notes Bernstein, would have had little knowledge \"that would have been of any use to the Alli es,\" but a great deal of expertis e that they would have wanted to keep from the hands of other powers such as France and Russia. Then follows another remark concerning Harteck's \"ultra-centr ifuge\" technology, wh ich \"would have been an extraordinarily useful thi ng for any country to possess.\" 7 Indeed, 3 Bernstein, op. cit, p. 81, n. 16. 4 Ibid., pp. 82-84. 5 Ibid., Cassidy, \"Introduction,\" p. xxix. 6 Ibid., p. 91, the conversation is between Heisenberg, Von Weizsacker, Wirtz, Harteck and Diebner on July 18, 1945. 7 Ibid., p. 91, n. 7. 141"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"this was a technology that even the US and UK had not brought to such an advanced state of perfection. And then, on July 26, 1945, a remark is made by Otto Hahn that only increases the mystery: \"1 re ad an article in the Picture Post about the uranium bomb; it said th at the newspapers had mentioned that such a bomb was being made in Germany. Now you can understand that we are being 'detained' because we are such men.\" 8 The editorial comment only increases the problem: \"This was before the bomb was used on Japan, when its existence was kept in strict secrecy!\" 9 Had Hahn unwittingly let the cat out of the box? It is an odd thing for a scientist of Hahn's stature to say, especially since, as we have seen, there were a wealth of \"indications\" of the size of the German project that ap peared in short articles in the Allied press both during and after the war. Then on July 21, 1945, the handsome and cynical Horst Korsching, discussing the pros pects for making a living with Diebner and Bagge, offers a curious observation: BAGGE: For the sake of the money, I should like to work on the uranium engine; on the other hand, I should like to work on cosmic rays. I feel like Diebner about this. KORSCHING: Would you both like to construct a uranium engine? DIEBNER: This is the chance to earn a living. KORSCHING: Every layman can see that these ideas are exceedingly important. Hence there won't be any money in it. You only make money on ideas which have escaped the general public. If you invent something like artificial rubies for the watch making industry, you will make more money than with the uranium engine. 10 Artificial rubies? Of course, such things were used in watchmaking before the invention of quartz movement. But in 1945, the idea was fantastic. Of course, by the time of the declassification of these transcripts, the world's first laser, which did in fact use an artificial 8 Bernstein, op. cit., p. 94. 9 Ibid., n. 19. 1 0 Ibid., p. 99. 142"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"ruby as the main component of the lasing optical cavity, was history, having been invented in 1961. But in July of 1945 the idea was more than a little ahead of its time. Is this another possible, though slight, indication that some thing else was going on inside Nazi Germany? Later in the conversation, Korsching expresses his desire to return to Hechingen to collect his telescope, lenses and prisms, an indication that he was perhaps involved in optical as well as  nuclear  research.  But then, another curious statement from Korsching: Of course it would be an idea to go to the Argentine with two people and say: \"Here we are, we know how to do this and that; we have a good method for the separation of isotopes, we do not need to produce heavy water.\" Somehow in this fashion we have to do it. It would not come to anything if you collaborated with Heisenberg on a uranium engine. They did not even bring alo ng the small fry to this place, that is how outsiders judge the work. 11 If the thesis presented thus fa r is true, and there was a very secretive SS bomb project and if th e Heisenberg represented a false front \"sham\" project being deliberate ly shut out of the loop by the SS and maintained for Allied cons umption, then in deed there may be other motivations for the inte rnment of the German scientists than are commonly suppo sed. If, for example, General Patton's Third Army troops did indeed find and discover components and scientists from the SS project, then it would have been crucial to ascertain whether or not the \"big fish\" - to paraphrase Korsching's rather self-important view of the scientists at Farm Hall - had had any knowledge of these SS projects. Then, in the transcripts of co nversations from August 1-6, 1945, Dr. Kurt Diebner briefly men tions a fact that carries great significance in the light of what we have discovered of the German atom bomb project and the SS Sonderkommando underground factories in the Harz Mountains in Thuringia. Diebner mentions very briefly that his supply of radium was obtained \"from the Harz.\" 12 Bernstein's comment at this juncture is of a brevity huge 11 Bernstein, op. cit., p. 100. 12 Ibid.,p. 111. 143"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"with omissions: \"A mountain range in central Germany.\" Bernstein does not have anything more to say about the subject. Is he ignorant of the claims being uncovered by contemporary German researchers? Or does the omission of mention stem from some other motivation? In any case, the te nor and mood of the scientists quickly changes when they learn of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The first reactions, recorded by the British micr ophones, occurs between Hahn and Wirtz: HAHN: They can only have done that if they have uranium isotope separation. WIRTZ: They have it too. 14 A discussion quickly ensues betwee n all the German scientists, and again it is Diebner who makes a short statement pregnant with significance: \"We always thought we would need two years for one bomb.\" 15 Moreover, Bernstein at this point betrays a hesitation and uncertainty unusual in his otherwise straightforward commentaries and annotations whose aim is clearly to maintain the Allied Legend: \"I am not sure whom Diebner includ es in his 'we' here or on what his estimate is based. But hi s use of the wo rd 'bomb' is unchallenged by the others.\" 16 Who indeed were the people that Diebner referred to when he said \"we\"? Bernstein appears not to know, but given that Diebner has ea rlier referred to his supply of radium \"in the Harz\", we may rationally speculate that Diebner was referring obliquely, and no doubt inte ntionally so, to his colleagues in the SS run program. Then follows a short, but astonishing, exchange between Hahn, Weizsacker, Harteck, Wirtz, and Diebner: 1 4 Bernstein, op. cit., p. 115, emphasis added. 1 5 Ibid., p. 117. 1 6 Ibid., p. 118. 144"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"HAHN: I think it's absolutely impossible to produce one ton of uranium 235 by separating isotopes. 17 WEIZSACKER: What do you do with these centrifuges?

HAHN: Yes, but they could do it with mass spectrographs. Ewald has some patent. 18 DIEBNER: There is also a photochemical process. 19 Now let us put all this in contex t, for this little exchange is an indication that a possibl e \"farce\" is being play ed out at Farm Hall, not only by the interred German scientists, bu t also possibly by the declassification of the transcripts themselves. What do I mean by this? Note that the tran scripts are declassified by the British after the German reunificat ion in 1989, an obli que admission, perhaps, that there was no more purpose in maintaining whatever secrets they still held, since there would now be othe r sources available to tell the story that had been long suppressed: that the Nazis had been either perilously clos e to, or had actually acquired the atom bomb before the Allies. First, note in the above exchange that Otto Hahn, whose remarks began this chapter, has now changed his mind. His earlier 17 This comment, in the light of what has already been learned about the size of the German enrichment program, can mean only one of two things: (1) Hahn is deliberately lying here, to deflect his on possible involvement in the program; or (2) he is telling the truth, and knows nothing about it. Of the two, the latter is the much more likely. 18 Again, Hahn has pointed the way clearly to Baron Manfred Von Ardenne's cyclotron modifications. Thus, the German scientists knew how to do it, and as is therefore extremely likely, the SS also knew which was the best method. Hence, the extraordinary power consumption at Auschwitz points, as does the most efficient method itself, to Von Ardenne's method as the method most likely used there and elsewhere to separate isotope. 19 Bernstein, op. cit., p. 118. 145"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"remarks mention isotope separation as the means to a bomb. Now, he has reversed himself, and all on the same day. But then comes Weizsacker's remark: What else would one used centrifuges for? 20 This is countered by remarks from the inventor himself, Paul Harteck, who maintained one cannot obtain \"pure 235\" via that process. Wirtz then chimes in wi th agreement, an d then Hahn, ever the radio-chemist, reverses himself again, within a matter of minutes, by coming to the obvious conclusion from a scientific and engineering standpoint: the be st way to obtain \"pure\" U 235 was via mass spectrography. But then comes the bombshell. Diebner, who clearly has some connection to Kammler's SS \"think ta nk\" special projects empire in the Harz mountains, alludes to an unknown \"photochemical\" process for isotope separation a nd enrichment. Even Bernstein admits that whatever Diebner m eant by this remark is \"unclear\" 21 In all likelihood, it is unclear, because it remains classified, somewhere, by someone . And that should gi ve us pause, for it means that the Kammle rstab may have found a method of isotope separation and enrichment that re mains otherwise u nknown to this day! Shortly after this revealing little exchange, Wirtz then offers another solution: \"I would bet,\" he says, \"that it is separation by diffusion with recycling.\" 22 Wirtz is clearly proposing that separation was a multi-st aged process, with the result of one pass through the separation process then being us ed as feedstock for another pass for enrichment to gr eater purity, and the process being repeated until the desired grade of purity - weap ons grade - was obtained. The diffusion process mentioned in this context is vague, for there were at least two meth ods known to the Germans, the Allies, and the Japanese under the name of \"diffusion\". One method, cited by Bernstein as the explanation of Wirtz's remarks, is the manufacture of uranium gas, and forcing it under pressure through sinterized metal. Sinteri zation simply mean s that a metal 20 As we shall discover, there may well have been another use to which this, or a modified, technology had been put by the SS. 21 Bernstein, op. cit, p. 117, n. 24. 22 Ibid., p. 118. 146"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"contains billions of micro-pores or holes of specific and tiny size, through which the atoms of different isotopes diffuse at slightly different rates of speed. \"The orig inal estimate was that 5,00 of these barriers would be needed fo r nearly complete separation, as opposed to 22,000 centrifuges.\" 21 The other process was thermal diffusion that was already examined more closely in chapter 7. The thermal diffusion method is mentioned briefly in the published Farm Hall transcripts during the conver sations of the German scientists on the day of the Hiroshima bombing by Weizsacker. 24 Bernstein notes of this me thod that it was being tried by Korsching, and that it consisted of a \"glass tube and heating coil to separate isotopes. It never worked well for uranium.\" 25 But what Bernstein has described is the or iginal Clusius-Dickel tube for thermal diffusion, a process that was not efficient, as Bernstein correctly indicates. However, a di fferent method of Clusius tubes was described by Wilcox in reference to the Japanese program: What the Nishina group finally did settle on was a process called thermal diffusion. This had been one of the first isotope separation processes devised. Bu un til it was perfected by two German scientists, Klaus Clusius and Gerhard Dickel, in 1938, it had not been practical. Stated simply, thermal diffusion relied on the fact that light gas moves toward heat. Clusius and Dickel cons tructed a simple device consisting chiefly of two metal tubes placed on e inside the other. The inner tube was heated; the outer tube was cool ed. When the apparatus was turned on, the lighter U-235 moved to the heat wall; the U-238, to the cold wall. Convex currents created by this movement sent the U-235 upward; the U-238 down ward. The result was something like a heated house in winter; hot air rising, cold air staying at the bottom. At a certain point the U-235 at the top could be collected, and new gas pumped in. It was a simple and rapid way to get relatively large concentrations of U-235. 26 And with repeated passes through a series of such vessels, purity would be increased. In any case, there is some discrepancy in the 23 Bernstein, op. cit., p. 119, n. 28. 24 Ibid., p. 199. 25 Ibid., p. 83, n. 27. 26 Robert K.

Perhaps the latter described a modification made to the original method, with extremes of heat and cold being applied. Harteck, Wirtz, and Heisenberg then continue the subject to isotope separation and enrichment a little further on: HARTECK: They have managed it with mass spectrographs on a large scale or else they have been successful with a photochemical process. WIRTZ: Well I would say photochemistry or diffusion, ordinary diffusion. They irradiate it with a particular wavelength (all talking together). At this juncture, Bernst ein again observes that \"it is not clear\" what this photochemical process is. 27 In any case, whatever the process was, Wirtz's mention of it and of irradiation with a particular \"wavelength\" appears to have provoked a burst of conversation from the other scientists. Were they intentionally trying to drown him out and mask his statements so as not to be recorded? We will never know. But in any case, the conversation continues: HARTECK: Or using mass spectrographs in enormous quantities. It is perhaps possible for a mass spectrograph to make 1 milligram in one day - say of \"235.\" They could make quite a cheap mass spectrograph, which, in very large quantities, might cost a hundred dollars. You could do it with 100,000 mass spectrographs. Again, Bernstein's comment is suggestive: \"This is essentially what the Allies did.\" 28 But it is also, as we ha ve seen, very probably what the Germans did at the \"Buna plant\" at Auschw itz and later, in the large underground factories run by Kammler's SS Sonderkommando. The Farm Hall scie ntists, as to be expected, seemed totally oblivious to this program, but have worked out the basic facts for themselves. HEISENBERG: Yes, of course, if you do it like that, and they seem to have worked on that scale, 180,000 people were working on it. 27 Bernstein, op. cit., p. 120, n. 37. 28 Ibid., p. 120, n. 38. 148"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"HARTECK: Which is 100 times more than we had. 29 It may have been 100 times more than Harteck or any of the high profile scientists interred at Farm Hall had at their disposal, but it was certainly not a number beyond the SS, with its hundreds of thousands of concentration camp slave laborers. Hahn later reinforces the pathetic plight of the \"Heisenberg group\" by adding \"Of course, we were unable to work on that scale.\" 30 Such facts and methods would doubtless ha ve been known to the Kammlerstab, and doubtle ss he would have pur sued them with his customary \"focus.\" Harteck then corroborated this view in a statement regarding the Clusius process, and his numbers reveal the dangerous potential for isotope separation and enrich ment that lay within Nazi Germany's capabilities if worked on a similarly large scale as the Manhattan Project: If it is a fact that an explosive can be produced either by means of the mass spectrograph - we would never have done it as we could never have employed 56,000 workmen. For instance, when we considered the Clusius-Linde business combined with our exchange cycle we would have needed to employ 50 workmen continuously in order to produce two tons a year. If we wanted to make ten tons we would have had to employ 250 men. We couldn't do that. 31 For Harteck and the other Farm Hall scientists, the problem was not means or methods, it was simp ly a labor shortage, a shortage the SS was not experiencing. Later, Harteck is even more specific: Considering the figures involved I think it must have been mass spectrographs. If they had had some other good method they wouldn't have needed to spend so much. One wouldn't have needed so many men. 29 Ibid., p. 120 30 Ibid., p. 121. 31 Ibid. 149"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Korsching responds, and a small debate ensues, in which a sensitive topic is barely touched upon by Ha rteck, and Bernstein's editorial comment becomes either an exercise in ignorance, or deliberate omission: KORSCHING: It was never done with spectrographs.

In Harteck's case, at least, we must opt for deliberate dissemblin g to a certain degree, for what he saw - if he was not co mpletely involved with it - was a vast enrichment program procee ding on the em aciated backs of concentration camp laborers. As if this were not enough, Weizsacker later corroborates the broad outlines of the top secret SS program we have outlined previously: WEIZSACKER: If you had wanted to make a bomb we would probably have concentrated more of the separation of isotopes and less on heavy water.... If we had started this business soon enough we could have got somewhere. If they were able to complete it in the summer of 1945, we might have had the luck to complete it in the winter 1944-45. 33 Note that he not only corrobora tes the broad time frame we have aleady found for the alle ged German atom bomb test at Rugen, but more importantly, his statemen t comes after Harteck's clear allusion to the existence of just such a program in Nazi Germany. A little later, the British military intelligence summary of the conversation that ensues interjects the following cryptic summary of comments made by Walter Gerlach, without any further commentary: \"Gerlach goes on to explain that the Nazi party seemed to think that they were working on a bomb and relates how the Party people in Munich were going round from house to house 33 Bernstein, op. cit., p. 123. 151"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"on the 27th or 28th of April last telling everyone that the atomic bomb would be used the following d a y . \" 34 Bernstein's editorial note reflects his confusion, a nd confirms that he is in all likelihood not familiar with the allegations of the tests at Rugen and Ohrdruf: \" It is not clear who has supposed to be using this weapon and against whom.\" 35 In any case, so far from contradi cting the possibility of a secret enrichment and bomb program, howev er, in the main the Farm Hall scientists seem to corroborate it. Finally, Harteck again must have stunned his British captors with a remark made near the e nd of the transcript for August 6, 1945: HARTECK: The multiplication factor with \"235\" is 2.8, and when one collides with the other how long is the path until it happens? 4 centimeters, Rx is the radius. Then you have to multiply that by the mean free path and divide it by the square root of the multiplication factor. That should be 3.2. Rx is about 14 centimeters, the weight is 200 kilograms; then it explodes. 36 Even Bernstein cannot ignore this , and his comment indicates the there is a \"possible something\" lurking behind Harteck's figures: This apparently off-hand calculation of the critical mass by Harteck which does lead to a sensible answ er, unlike Heisenberg's shows some evidence that he had done this problem before. It is difficult to believe that he would have known, for example, that the critical radius involved the inverse square root of the multiplica tion factor if he had not thought about it. How Harteck got the number 2.8 for the multiplication factor is unclear. During the war the Los Alamos people, who certainly knew a lot more than he did, used 2.2. Only after the war was the number increase to 2.52 as the measurements became better. Perhaps it was Harteck who supplied the German Army Ordnance report of January 1942 with its numbers in the scientists' attempts to interest the Army in continuing support of bomb research. 37 34 Ibid., p. 126. 35 Ibid., n. 85. 36 Ibid., p. 133. 37 Ibid., n. 121. 152"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"perhaps Harteck had \"run the numbers\" before.

But from the perspective of the evidence presented here, that was not the real military picture in December 1941 at all, not was it in the secret counsels that the Germ an dictator kept in his mind. His scientists, after all, had discovered nuclear fission, and his scientists had proposed a method of obtai ning an atom bomb via large quantities of isotope separation and enrichment machines and huge concentrations of labor. His scientists would, in a month or so, assure him, via the Heereswa ffenamt memorandum, that the amount of material need ed for a bomb was no t tons, but kilograms. And his favorite atomic scientist, Manfred Von Ardenne, and his associate Dr. Fritz Houtermans, had already published a manuscript on how it could all be done.

In retrospect, then, the secrec y surrounding the German project seems all too clear, for the best source of cheap labor lay in the death camps, camps that Hitler desired to ke ep secret from the German people, for obvious reas ons. By early 1941 Farben had already begun construction of its \"Buna plant\" at Auschwitz. And there was more probably lurking in Hitler's twisted mind: before the war, some scientists in the Reic h had spelled out the basic idea behind a weapon even more power ful than the atom bomb, for which the latter was but a fuse. Hitler, on this view, ever the gambler, too the risk, confident of being in the possession of a fearful arsenal within a short span of two to three years, and declared war on the United States. So too the military deployments and operations of the European war's end that made little sens e before now begin to take on an 155"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"operational logic that is almost irresistible. The madcap, and some would say, militarily an d politically indefensib le, Allied dash away from Berlin and to south central Germany and Prague are consistend with American knowledge, at some very high level, of Kammler's SS Sonderkommando black projects and secret weapons empire. Hitler's own obsession with the defe nse of Breslau in lower Silesia and of Prague itself, an obses sion that made no sense to his generals, make military sense only in the context of an atom bomb and intercontinental rocket project that was successful in the attainment of the first and perilous ly close to the attainment of the second. Similarly, Reichsfuhrer SS He inrich Himmler's offer of a surrender to the Western Allies has usually been dismissed as the frantic attempts of a desperate mass murderer to avoid his inevitable fate, and nothing more. But Himmler, like Hitler, and possibly only Martin Bormann, was one of the \"inmost circle\" who knew the full extent of Kammler' s empire and its actual activities Himmler may have therefore used this knowledge as a possible bargaining chip. His offer was rejected, not so much because it was not genuine(from Himmler's point of view), but because he had long lost genuine control of it. Th e deal had already probably been cut between Kammler's representa tives and OSS station chief in Zurich, Allen Dulles, or via Gene ral Patton himself. Bormann, too as we have seen, was implicated in this plot, and, as we shall see in subsequent chapters, is directly linked to Kammler.

Likewise, this thesis provides a more plausible ex planation, for t hose inclined to think it suspicious, for the myst erious death of America's most celebrated and famous, and for the equally impossible \"triple death\" of Germany's most sinister, genera ls. Patton, as was seen, was the commander of the very America ar my entrusted wi th seizing the motherload of secret weapons rese arch treasures in Thuringia and at Pilsen in Czechoslovakia. He , at the top of the Third Army's command structure, would have been privy to all the first intelligence reports of his units entering those areas, and would easily have been the first man outside Kammler himself to see enough of the pieces to put togeth er a reasonable picture of the whole. If indeed Patton was delib erately silenced, and I am by no means convinced that he was, then surely this is the most plausible motivation for the deed. And fina lly, as was seen, a successful German atom bomb project might very well me the inner moral logic at work in the German Resistance's bo mb plot against Adolf Hitler in July of 1944. Similarly, the thesis puts on a firmer foundation another set of \"oddities,\" such as the ludicrous notion that the Allied engineers were so confident that their desi gn for the Little Boy uranium bomb dropped on Hiroshima was so good it did not need to be tested, or (in another explanation), that th ere was not eno ugh weapons grade uranium to build two such bombs to test one before dropping the other. That the US military would have dropped an untested superweapon on an enemy city, an enemy known to be working on acquiring the very same weapon, is simply ridiculous in the extreme. The Allied Legend is made even more ridiculous when one considers the fact that the plutonium bomb had been successfully tested, a nd that a plutonium bo mb was already ready for deployment against the Japane se. Why then was the \"untested\" Little Boy dropped first, instead of the plutonium \"Fat Man\"? A rational explanation is afforded by the thesis of this part of the book: Little Boy was not tested by the Americans because, as Oppenheimer hinted, the bomb wa s \"of German provenance.\" The Americans did not need to test it, because its German designers already had. 157"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Moreover the infusion of Germ an bomb technology into not only the American, but the Japanese effort, explains Japan's rather slow response to Allied demands for unconditional surrender after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for only a day after Nagasaki, the Japanese too, for a brief moment, jo ined the nuclear club.

Why indeed , unless that progra m leads to a wholly different scientific paradigm, deve loped in secret and off the pages of the textbooks of mainstream \"science \" proffered for public consumption? Much of the answer to these que stions lies in occulted aspects of the Nazi Reich's ideology, and in the structures of power and bureaucracy it put into place to pursue that ideo logy. Much of the answer to these questions lies in the connection of Kammler's Sonderkommando to its parent organization, the SS itself. The nature of that organization, at its very heart, at the uppermost pinnacle of its power structure, was in every sense of the word occult. There are two facts that dire ctly connect Kammler's black, underground, and very se cret weapons and deat h camps empire, to this occult aspect of the Third Re ich and its SS \"Black Order.\" These two odd connections require in turn an investigation - cursory though it will have to be - of the occult doctrines themselves in order that we may cl early discern the outlines of their influence on the more sensational German weapons research of the war. In connection w ith Kammler's empire and its postwar continuation, it is best to unde rstand that this science is an \"occulted science.\" A. Some Necessary Definitions For our purposes, this \"occulted sc ience\" is to be understood as contained in various artifacts: ancient mysteries, various esoteric or other \"occult traditions \" per se, and actual phys ical structures or other types of physical artifacts .

Thus, our thesis and method is that there is an \"occulted physics\" hidden - sometimes deli berately - within vari ous mythological and ancient texts, including tests of the esoteric or occult traditions both of the Orient and of the Occide nt. This belief was one of the cornerstones of the Nazi secret weapons research, and it produced some astounding failures, as well as grist for the mill of its less well known, but equally astounding success es. This thesis has formed a major component in my two previous works, 2 and was a major component in the ideological belief structure of the upper echelons of the SS and its more important and secretive departments, including the Ahnenerbedienst. There is every indication that it also formed a major paradigm for the upper echelons of Kammler's secret weapons \"think tank\" and was possibly even its very raison d'etre. The occulted aspect of the term \"occulted science' therefore takes on an extension of meaning beyond what one normally comes to associate with th e term \"occult\". For our purposes, this \"occulted science\" is occulted in the sense of: (1) \"hidden\" or \"dark\" and therefore hidden in the sense of black and covert secret classified projects; (2) \"deliberately encoded scienc e\" found in texts or artifacts that are, as the deliberate pr oducts of such encoding, subject to the full range of standard typological a nd analogical interpretive methods conventio nally employed to understand such texts, but in this case , they are not understood on a metaphysical basis but rather in a \"proto-scientific\" sense, a \"proto-physics\" sense; 2 Q.v.

Into the Labyrinth of the Best In part one, evidence of a possible German atom bomb test at or the island of Rugen in the Baltic Sea was presented. This evidence stemmed primarily from the recently declassified affidavit of Hans Zinsser who saw and desc ribed the explosi on and resulting mushroom cloud, and the testim ony of Italian officer Luigi Romersa, who was there apparently as an obs erver for Mussolini's Italian Fascist government. Corr oborating evidence of secret wartime British atom bomb alerts and German telephone outages in Berlin - events concurrent with the time frame of the test - were presented. But what of Rugen itself? Why test a weapon on a sparsely populated island that is so close to the population center of Kiel and its heavily trafficked se a lanes and canal? What is it about Riigen that is so significant that the SS would test an atom bomb there? The answer may come from its po ssible connection to the SS's special \"occult research\" depart ment, the Ahnenerbedienst, the society personally established by Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler to investigate all manne r of occult and esoter ic doctrines for its possible scientific value and we aponization. Among the strange and irrational doctrines entertained by Himmler and others at the pinnacle of the SS was a peculiar twist to the \"Hollow Earth\" theory. In its even more irrational Himmler varia tion, this theory held that the earth was hollow, and that its surface - the surface that the fanatical SS leadership actually liv ed on - was the inside of that \"hollow earth\". And thus 165"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"According to an article in Popular Astronomy in June 1946, entitled \"German Astronomy During the War\": \"They considered it helpful to locate the British fleet, because the curvature of the earth would not obstruct observation. Visual rays were not suitable because of refraction; but infrared rays had less refraction. Accordingly a party of about ten men under the scientific leadership of Dr. Heinz Fischer, an infrared expert, was sent out from Berlin to the isle of Rugen to photograph the British fleet with infrared equipment at an upward angle of some forty-five degrees.\" The experiment did not work. 3 One is left with the impression that this \"experiment\" with irrationality was but another manifest ation of the scientific quackery that was the Third Reich, and righ tly so. But significantly, once again, this rather avante gard e experiment, no matter how irrational, took place on Riigen. Apparently, the island was home to a number of advanced projects. On e should also not e carefully the hidden technological implication of the experiment, not withstanding the insane use to which it was put: the Nazis possessed the means of detection of infrared reflec tions from great distances though atmospheric refraction, the same technology as was developed for use in heat-seeking anti-aircraft mi ssiles and subsequently used with dramatic destructive effectiveness in America's plutonium bomb. And this afford a clue into the real nature of Kammler's \"think tank\": technology ap pears to have been de veloped that could be adapted to a variety of uses in the various highly classified weapons developments black pr ojects, as well as used in experimentation and testing of th e more bizarre aspects of Nazi and occult beliefs. But again, why Rugen? The answer lies in the \"esoteric history\" of the island prior to the war, a nd indeed, prior to World War One! When the Second Worl d War ended, Hitler's private library was discovered in a mine near his idyllic mountain aerie of Berchtesgaden. Several tomes and volumes of occult literature were contained in it, including a \"coll ection of (Lanz) Von Liebenfels' 3 Dusty Sklar, The Nazis and the Occult, p. 79. 166"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"racist-occult magazine Ostara,\" published in Vienna before the First World War. 4 While Hitler's own membership in any occult lodge has not been conclusively demonstrat ed, it is very pr obable that the young dictator-to-be actually visited Von Liebenfels while both were in Vienna before World War One. 5 It is Von Liebenfels and his Order of the New Templars that forms the connection between the SS, irrational \"Hollow Earth\" experiments, and the far more su ccessful atom bomb test at Rugen. with the assistance of wealthy patrons who soon flocked to his secret society - a society dedicated to the \"purification\" of the German race from its corrupt ing influences (Jews, Slavs, \"Mongoloids\" and basically anyone not \"Germanic\" or \"Aryan\") - Von Liebenfels was able to pur chase and renovate several old castles throughout Austria and Germany and to transform them into centers for his Order. Th e Order, in addition to its racist ideology, also dabbled in \"astrology, th e Cabala, phrenology, homeopathy, and    nutrition.\" 6 In any case, Von Liebenfels, in th e best traditions and tactics of classical \"Christian Gnosticism,\" a nd with the aid of his monastic training as a Cistercian monk, \"composed his own voluminous variations of liturgical texts: a two volume New Templars' Breviary, The Psalms in Germ an, and a 'secret Bible for the initiated' which ran to ten volumes, as well as prayer books and the like.\" 7 With money pouring into hi s order from its wealthy \"initiates\", one of the castles he bought and restored as a center for esoteric research and \"New Templa r\" activism was on the island of Rugen . 8 Hitler was, according to Von Lieben fels in a letter to one of his New Templars, \"one of our pup ils.

Indeed, the Nazis severely regulated - almost to the point of s queezing it into complete non-existence - any public display of \"occultism\" or \"secret society\" activity. Hence, Himmler's motivations for creating the SS Ahnenerbedienst within the bureaucracy of the SS becomes clearer, for the regime was in part fearful of its own connection to the highest level to such societies and activities. By placing such activities under SS jurisdiction, they could be monitored, studied, funded, organized, and exploited in complete secrecy. What was the Ahnenerbe? In many respects it was the most secret of all the SS' myriad secret departments. Imagine that the evening adult education program of the New School of Social Research had suddenly become an independent government agency with a budget as big as the Defense Department, with Lyndon Larouche as president and, perhaps, Elizabeth Clark Prophet as the physics chairperson (sic). Or maybe the summer session at the University of California Berkely, had become militarized and all the students had immunity from prosecution for any crime they had committed, or would ever commit, and could conduct any form of independent study they l i k e d as long as they wore their black uniforms with the silver death's head insignia at all times and swore an oath of personal loyalty to the dean. The one might have some idea of what the Ahnenerbe was, and of the type of people it first attracted to its ranks. It was a humanities program. With guns. 10 This bizarre and irrational element of the occult at the very heart of Himmler's Blac k Order of the SS is one of the hidden entities, for example, coordinating and conducting the gruesome \"medical experiments\" on concen tration camp victims, and even on ordinary Germans, during the war. During the height of the wa r, the insan ity gripping the Ahnenerbe and its macabre and bizarre experiments became almost surreal. The bureau devoted so much manpower and money to \"esoteric research projects that it began to seem as if (Himmler) 9 Ibid., p. 21. 1 0 Levenda, op. cit., pp. 151-152. 168"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"hoped to turn the tide in Germany's favor by fathoining the secrets of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry , the occult m eaning of Gothic spheres the top hats worn by the boys at Eton, and the symbolism involved in the suppression of the Ulster harp.\" 11 Among its most ambitious projects, enormous amounts of money were spent For a flight to Tibet to look for traces of a pure Germanic race which might have been able to keep intact the ancient Nordic mysteries. The Ahnenerbe also had archeologists digging up all of Europe for remains of Germanic culture. More than fifty departments in this branch succeeded in spending over a million marks ($400,000) on such \"vital\" matters. But the most incredible research of all was set up in 1939 in Merlin. An astrologer, Wilhelm Wulff, who was made prisoner of the SS and coerced into working for it, described the Berlin Institute's scientific research center as being used '\"to harness, not only natural, but also supernatural, forces. All intellectual, natural, and supernatural sources of power -from modern technology to mediaeval black magic, and from the teachings of Pythagoras to the Faustian pentagram incantation - were to be exploited in the interests of final victory.\" 12 One such experiment resembles noth ing else so much as an early experiment in \"remote viewing\" , and included a man who was an alleged \"adept,\" who held out pen dulums over pictures of U-boats, and then held it over maps of the ocean in attempts to detect it. If all this seems insane and fru itless dabbling, c onsider that the modern phenomenon of \"remote vi ewing\" is a highly developed enterprise - undertaken initially in secret by the CIA 13 - and employed at one time none other than re nowned theoretical physicist Dr. Hal Puthoff in the el aboration of strictly controlled scientific protocol s for its testing. 14 Moreover, note what is actually 11 Sklar, op. cit, p. 101. 12 Sklar, op. cit., p. 102, emphasis added. 13 A fact that in itself should give one pause, especially in view of the subsequent importation of many of these Nazi \"esoteric scientists\" into the USA under the aegis of Operation Paperclip. 14 Q.v.

It is important to mention that most of Dr. Puthoff's theoretical physics research concerns quantum mechanics and the Zero Point Energy, or vacuum quantum flux potential. Puthoff has noted the connection between quantum mechanics and the consciousness of intelligent obs ervers. More recently the connection between intelligent life and physics at the topological level has been a major focus of papers by Ukrainian theoretical physicist Dr. Volodymyr Krasnoholovets, and French topologist Michel Bounias. 15 Nick Cook, The Hunt for Zero Point, p. 209. 170"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"While no direct evidence has been forthcoming to date, there is a factor - beyond his involvement w ith the death camps - that does connect Kammler with the Ahnenerb e, and this brings us to that \"second odd fact\", a de tail that seems to indicate that there was indeed a connection between the Ahnenerbe's occult interests and Kammler's black secret weapons projects \"think tank.\" This is the fact that at its very pinnacle, th e SS was deliberately conceived and organized by Heinrich Himmler to be an occult \"order,\" a black and twisted version of King Arthur's Knights of the Holy Grail and Round Table. One observes here, once agai n, the connection to the ideal the Templars and Von Liebenfels' \"New Templars,\" for whom the \"holy Grail\", or sang real, was the \"royal bloodline\" itself and its \"contain er\" or \"chalice\", the Germanic Aryan race. As a r e s u l t of this view, the Ahnene rbe's \"medical experiments\" were done not only to advance German medicine in areas of treatment of extreme conditions - high pressure , low pressure, an d so on - that were encountered in extreme climates or, eventually, outer space, but a considerable portion was devoted to finding the basis of genetic and ethnic \"purity\" of the Germanic race itself. The SS was therefore the vangua rd, the prophetic forebear, of the new religion and new age and new man it hoped to usher in: The headquarters for this cult was situated at the medieval castle of Wewelsburg, near the towns of Paderborn and Detmold in the German province of Westphalia, close by the site in the Teutoburg Forest where Arminius made his stand with its famous, Stonehenge-like monument known as Externsteine.... Secrecy was the key element in the SS and most especially at Wewelsburg. 16 There Himmler had constructed a central chamber with a large table designed to seat twelve men speci ally selected from the senior Gruppenfuhrers (gen erals) of the SS. 17 A 12,000 volume library of the occult was available in the castle. 1 6 Levenda, op. cit, pp. 155-156. 1 7 Ibid., citing Padfield, Himmler: Re ichsfuhrer-SS (New York: Henry Holt & Co., 1990), p. 248. 171"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"C. The Black Sun, the Cele stial Swastika, and Other SS Connections Central to the secret initiation th at these senior SS generals received was the real significance of the anagram \"SS\" itself. For the \"rank and file elite\" of the SS, the initials stood for the German word Schutzstaffel, a term mean ing loosely a special staff or military unit. But to the initiates, there was another meaning of \"SS\" altogether, a meaning with r oots deep in the occult and in ancient Sumerian, Babyl onian, and to a certai n extent, Egyptian belief. For these initiates , the letters \"SS\" refe rred to die Schwatze Sonne, the Black Sun. The doctrine of the Bl ack Sun, reaching ba ck to ancient Sumer and Akkadia, is that there are two suns, the \"white\" sun, the sun that we see at the center of ou r physical solar system, and the \"black\" sun, a \"hidden\" sun of (spiritual) illumination. In some versions of the myth, it is thought to reside at the center of our galaxy. Other embellishments place it as one of the causes of the immortality and reincarn ation of the soul. In Babylonian mythology it was also associated with the co ming of the \"King of kings\" and the establishment of a New Baby lon. And finally, in some variations, not only is it associated with the center of the galaxy, but also with the uttermost \"Hyperborea\" and \"Thule\", the legendary stellar home a nd celestial origin of th e Aryan race. The doctrine received further modification in ancient Egypt. The connection between the SS and Egypt is fu rther evidenced by the case of on e of the most famous esot ericists of all: R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz. Well known to contemporary students of \"alternative\" or \"revis ionist\" Egyptology, de Lubicz' claim to fame was his life-long undertaking to re interpret the monuments, and more importantly, the writings of ancient Egypt, particularly its hieroglyphic system of writ ing.

Briefly put, de Lubicz viewed Egyptian hieroglyphics and cu lture as the visible signs of a highly developed culture of analogical, rather than analytical, thought, science, and practice. 19 For him, anal ogical thought was synonymous with \"act ion at a distance,\" 20 and his thought here is quite in line with what was beginning to be bandied about in quantum mechanics, and has become a provable reality in our day, with the phenomenon of photon entanglement. This phenomenon, briefly put, is as follows. Imagine two photons have been simultaneously emitted from a particular atom, but traveling in different directions. Thus, both photons carry the harmonic systems signature, the in formation, of the original atom and the circumstances of their emission. Then, imagine changing the informational signature of one of the two photons. Because the other photon is an exact analog of the first photon, it will simultaneously introduce the change into the field of its own information, instantaneously, regardless of distance. 21 But it is important to note that for de Lubicz, this analogical action at a distance or sympathetic magic was expressed within the context of a broadly dualistic worl d view in which there were two sciences, one of gene sis or creation, and one of destruction. 22 In 18 De Lubicz's observation, in fact, inspired John Anthony West and Robert Shock's investigations which have re-dated the Sphinx to approximately 8,000 B.C. based on geological evidence, a conclusion that sent shock waves - no pun intended - through the Egyptology community and continues to spark vigorous debate in academic circles. 1 9 Q.v.

For then, it \"played the role of a central s un to our entire solar system\" and suggested to de Lubicz \"the existen ce of a cosmic system of atomic structure whose nucl eus is this 'Great Provider,' the Sothis... of the ancients.\" 23 De Lubicz would have know n as well the ancient symbolism and association with the three colors of the German national flag - black, red, and white - with ancient Egypt and Atlantis, 24 a symbolism of which the N azis themselves were likely aware. Thus in its Egyptian variation, the \"Black Sun\" myth is bound up with the star system of Sirius, and with all the associations with death resurrection, and the \"life force\" that this entailed within Pharaonic religion. For the SS Ahnenerbe, all this was a po tent mix when one recalls that Himmler's stated purpose for it, reveled in a letter he wrote to an Ahnenerbe scientist, was not only to study ancient religion, science, and the occult , but also that its principal establishment was as \"an institute for military scientific research.\" 24 Consequently, the Ahnenerbe scie ntists working on its various secret projects had an ideological basis for the more mundane scientific view that the \"Black Sun\" was but the extremely strong gravitational force exhibited by th e large mass rota ting around the galactic center.

By war's end and his control of all secret weapons projects in Nazi Germany, Hans Kammler had attained the rank of SS Obergruppe nfuhrer, the equi valent rank of a four star general, and only on e rank below th at of Himmler himself. Given this hi gh rank, it is thus no t only possible but very probably that Kammler was one of the chosen \"Knights\" of Himmler's \"round table\", and thus it is probable th at by the war's and Kammler had a deeply connected relationship to the Ahnenerbe and its occult activities. It may be in part for th is reason that his dossier in the US gove rnment's archives rema ins classified to this day. In any case, there is yet another odd fact, one that again potentially connects Kammler with the Ahnenerbe. Heinrich Himmler, who viewed himself as having some sort of \"psychic connection\" with the famous mediaeval German Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich the Fowler, had the Emperor's remains dug up and reinterred in the cathedral of the little town of Quedlinburg. Quedlinburg is in the Harz Mountains, in the heart of the region that was the center of Kammler's empire of underground secret weapons plants and laboratories. In any case, the Ahnenerbe in general and Himmler's Gruppenfuhrer initiates in particular did more than dabble in the patently absurd projec ts mentioned previous ly. It also mounted secret armed expeditions to Sout h America to recover the well- known crystal skulls to investigate their optical properties. It ransacked ancient texts and the works of Sanskrit and other classical scholars for clues to \"Vedic mathematics.\" The SS inducted the Muslim Grand Mufti of Jerusalem into its ranks with the honorary rank of major, an act with its own dark, and contemporary, significance. 26 The Ahnenerbe would mount an expedition to Tibet, and return wi th the only comp lete copy of the multi-volumed Buddhist Kang Shur to reach the West, a collection reputedly containing much lost info rmation from the pre-classical, ancient \"atlantean\" world. 26 Sebottendorff, for example, one of the occult figures lurking in the background of the secret societies that had connections with the early Nazi movement, praised Islam's \"vitality\" and congruence with Nazi ideology. 177"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"D.

To that significant extent, the scientist himself pr edetermined the results of the experiment a priori, in an act of \"sovereign will.\" In short, on the level of the very small, the scientist could, so to speak, \"predetermine reality\" simply by the way an experiment was configured.

The \"Superbombs\" As we have seen, before the cu rtain of silence and spin came down after the war, a number of small articles appeared in the Allied press about the actual state of German atom bomb research. One of these was an article that appeared in the Evening Standard on August 7, 1945, on e day after the Littl e Boy atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It is worth citing this article in full: GERMANS TIMED ATOM BOMB FOR OCTOBER The Germans had an atom bomb which would have been ready by October. A colossal blast effect was claimed for the German bomb. It was said it would wipe out everything inside a radius of six miles, said B.U.P. to-day. The German atomic plans were uncovered four months ago, when an Allied search party walked into a small silk factory at Celle, north of Hanover. A laboratory of two rooms was buried away in the heart of the factory. A famous research scientis t was still at work. He was flown to Britain the same day. This man, with others, had been working on the atom bomb for months. The Nazi Government poured out money on it. Apparently they did not expect immediate results. 26 There are a number of disquieting things about this article. First, one gains the impression from the re port that the \"l aboratory\" was not even known to the Allies until the factory was occupied. Second, there is already evidence of a \"spin\" in the report, as the German program is u nderstood to have been underway for only a few \"months.\" But the final and most unusual thing is that its blast effects, some 6 miles radius, or 12 miles in diameter, is far beyond the blast damage radius of even a large atom bomb, much less a fuel air bomb. The only known weapon with this extraordinarily sized blast radius is a fully-fledged hydrogen bomb.

But was there sufficient basic theory for the German s to have thought of the hydrogen bomb at that early stage? 27 1. The \"Molecular\" Bomb : The Hydrogen Bomb? The idea of a \"Superbomb\" was fi rst patented prior to World War Two in Austria, and a modification of the idea was patented in Germany in 1943. 28 Its inventor, Dr. Karl Nowak, explained the reason for his invention as being to create a superbomb without the radioactive fallout effects that were evident from atomic and thermonuclear explosions! 29 In other words, the Nazis were already looking past the thermonuclear ag e toward the creation of second and third generation w eapons systems that would give the same offensive and strategic \"punch\" but with out the side effects! In theory, the bomb is workable, but was way beyond the technological capabiliti es of Germany, or any other power, in that time period. Basically, the idea was to create a state of matter in which, through ultra-low temperatur es approaching absolute zero, matter would be super-compressed. The idea was then to detonate this material, subjecting it to su dden stress and he at, to create a sudden and massive expansion a nd explosion, and therewith, an enormous, H-bomb sized blast. 30 Thus, there may have been a basis in actual German secret research for the incredible claim of the Japanese military attache in Stoc kholm's 1943 report to Tokyo that the Germans were investigating the properties of super-dense matter for weaponization. 27 It should be recalled that Dr. Edward Teller actually first thought of, and proposed to the Allies, the hydrogen bomb in 1944. 28 German patent 905.847, March 16, 1943, cited in Mayer and Mehner, Hitler und die ,,Bombe\", p. 159. 29 Ibid., p. 159. 30 Ibid., p. 158. 190"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"2. The Fuel-Air Bomb At the \"small end\" of the \"bom bs of mass destruction scale,\" however, there are equally baffling, and problematical, assertions regarding Nazi research into the fuel-air bomb, the only known conventional explosive device wi th enough power to produce the blast and heat effects of a small \"tactical\" nu clear weapon. It goes without saying that today's \"tacti cal nuke\" would have been World War Two's strategic weapon. Once ag ain, the first allegations of this type of bomb did not come with Gulf War One in the early 1990s, but with Renato Vesco. And hi s claims there, as elsewhere, were quietly ignored. But once agai n, declassification has verified his assertions, and to an extraordinary degree: (g) Liquid Air bomb As the research on the atomic bomb under Graf von Ardenne and others was not proceeding as rapidly as had been hoped in 1944, it was decided to proceed with the de velopment of a liquid air bomb. Experiments using ordinary powdered coal were not at all successful, but extremely good results were obtained from a mixture consisting of 60% finely powdered dry brown coal and 40% liquid air. The technical man responsible for this work was Dr. Zippelmeier. The first trial was made on the Doberitz grounds near Berlin using a charge of about 8 kg of powder in a thin tin plate container. The liquid air was poured on to the powder, and the two were mixed together with a long wooden stirrer. Kreutzfeld did this himself, and was present at the ensuing test. In an area of radius 500 to 600 meters trees, etc. were all completely destroyed. Thereafter the explosion started to rise and only the tops of the trees were affect ed, although the intensive explosion covered an area 2 km. in radius. Zippelmeier then had the idea that a better effect might be obtained it the powder was spread out in the form of a cloud before the explosion. Trials were made with a paper container impregnated with some waxy substance. A metal cylinder was attached to the lower end of this container and hit the ground first, dispersing the powder. After a short time interval of the order of 1/4 second a small charge in the meta l cylinder exploded and ignited the dark funnel shaped dust - liquid air cloud. The bombs had to be filled immediately prior to the departure of the aircraft. Bombs with charges 191"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"of 25 and 50 kg. of powder were dropped on the Starbergersee, and photographs of the explosion were taken. Standartenfuhrer Klumm kept a photograph of the result and showed it to Brandt (Himmler's personal adviser(sic)). The intensiv e explosion covered an area 4 to 4.5 km radius, and the explosion was still felt on a radius 12.5 km. When the bomb was dropped on an airfield, much destruction was caused 12 km away, and all the trees on a hillside 5 to 6 km away were flat. On a radius of 12.5 km. only the tops of the trees were destroyed. 31 Several important considerations are worth mentioning here. First, note the truly massive size and ar ea of devastation caused by the relatively small fuel-air bomb, for the area covered by the second test is commensurate with the blast from a large atom bomb: 6 kilometers' radius. Second, note that Zippelmeier has had a similar insight to Dr. Nowak's \"molecular bomb\": compression of material and then rapid dispersion over an area prior to detonation. This is only one step short of a modern fuel air bomb with its chain molecules and electrical, instan taneous, rather than slower chemical, detonation. So in other words, regardless of whether or not the Nazis actually detonate d atom bombs during World War Two, they did have a weapon of mass destruction as powerful as an atom bomb, and one that did not have radioactive side effects.

Finally, it is to be noted that this test to ok place under the direct auspices of the SS, Himmler's representative himself being present for it.

The Historical Problematic: German possession of even a pr ototype fuel-air bomb during World War Two causes a number of historical problems, and it is worth considering them and their implications. 1. The Cold War First, the test of such a device during the war w ould give lie to the contemporary \"public\" history of the fuel -air bomb, since they are only supposed to be the offs hoot of American thermonuclear research and dating from the ear ly 1980s. Doubtless, the modern fuel-air bomb is nothing like the early German prototype, with its chain molecules and simultaneous electrical detonation, it is a lighter, and much more powerful device. Second, if the technology existed for such enormous conventional bombs capable of reaking strategic large scale destruction on the order of smal l atom bombs, why were untold billions spent on much more expe nsive atomic and thermonuclear bombs, whose side-effects included deadly radioactivity, and why was the charade continued for so long? The exis tence of such weapons indicates that at so me very profound, and little appreciated, level, the Cold War was a partial sham. Third, the basic idea for such a weapon had, in fact, been explored by Austria (p rior to its annexation by Germany), and then subsequently both by Italy and Germany in the years immediately prior to the war. The idea is si mple, and the effects obvious. So why did it take this lo ng to obtain the weapon? Or is there a history that has not yet come to light ? Given what we have already encountered in part one regarding allegations of the German use of some weapon of extraordinary st rategic explosiv e power on the Eastern Front, it seems likely that some similar type of weapon was already in use. The Zippelmeier test may thus only have been a test, not of the concept itself, but of how large of a weapon could actually be made. The re sults, as have been seen, were probably beyond even the Nazis' wildest destructive dreams. 193"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"2. The Alchemy of Atlantis: the \"Mission Brief\" of the Kammler stab But what do all these fantastic projects indicate about the nature of German secret weapons resear ch? We may draw a number of conclusions from the evidence presented thus far, and in so doing, speculatively reconstruct the \"mi ssion briefing\" of the secret weapons think tank being run by Kammler's SS Sonderkommando: (1) Overlapping technologies were to be developed that could be employed in across a wide variety of various weapons systems (Stealth and RAM technology, etc); (2) Every available method for the creation of prototypical \"smart weapons\" was to be pursed (wire, radio, and television-guidance systems), i.e., German technological and engineering competence were to be exploited to the maximum; (3) This technological competence wa s to be pursued in (then) unconventional ways and combin ations to create not only new weapons, but a new doctrine of warfare; (4) The first generation of these weapons were then to be extrapolated upon, and se cond and th ird generation technology trees and long range goals mapped out; (5) The ultimate quest was for the attainment of weapons of mass destruction beyond the acquisition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons; (6) Post-nuclear systems were then to be developed ideally, and initial research on those syst ems undertaken; and finally, as we shall see, (7) Every known theoreti cal principle of physics was to be pondered and extrapolations fo r weaponization theorized, and, to the extent possible, experimented upon and utilized. In other words, the Kammlerstab 's mission brief was to think \"outside the box\" entirely, even if that meant outside the box of Nazi party ideology, or , when it suited it, in side it. The basis was the will to power, by whatever means possible. 194"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"3. Whose Military-Industrial Complex? All these considerations raise a final problematic, and one so obvious that I hesitate mentioning it, since ot hers have before, only to be dismissed or not taken seriously.

Having fought the world's first \"military- industrial complex\" and doubtless seen at least some of its extraordinary inventory of weapons and theoretical papers, President Eisenhower is surely raising another ominous, though overlooked, specter: Just w hose military-industrial complex is he really warning about?

If so, are there any indications that they did so, or were beginning to? While the indications in terms of actual papers are slight, those indications, coupled with the revelations that have come from Germany since its reunification, s uggest that the answer to both questions is \"yes.\" A. Gravity, Vortices, and Quantum Numerology Dr. Ing. Ott Christ oph Hilgenberg was a student of the renowned Nobel laureate Walter Ge rlach, whose work in magnetic spin polarization in 1921 had earned him the Nobel Prize. Hilgenberg, however, wh ile within the \"mains tream\" of physics, was not one to allow his mind to be constrained by conventional concepts, as any glance at hi s two little know n, but quite unconventional and thought-pr ovoking papers will attest. In 1931 Hilgenberg published what may best be called an arcane paper entitled \"Gravitation, Tr omben, und Wellen in bewegten Medien,\" or \"Gravitation, Beats, and Waves in Moving Media.\" The title itself is quit e suggestive, for it is the first indication that, even before the Nazis, and after relativity, at least one serious and respected German physicis t is still thinking of the old idea of an aether, but thinking about it in a wa y quite different from the static 198"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"aether concepts of the 19th century that led to the famous Michelson-Morley experiment, and Sagnac's rotational version of it. For Hilgenberg is thinking of a dynamic aether, spurred in part no doubt by the implications of Sagnac's version of the famous experiment. Hilgenberg's paper was arcane and abstruse in the extreme, advocating the idea of grav itation as a vertical ether sink. Thus, as in relativity, gravity was the consequence of a complex geometry, only in Hilgenberg's case, this meant that \"mass\" was a geometric result manifest, for example, in a rotating body's interior. This led Hilgenberg to propose the very unconventional idea that the earth - or any ot her such rotati ng massive body - expanded and contracted, in a huge wave-like pattern over time. In 1938 Hilgenberg followed this paper up with a mathematical and theoretical physics tour de force entitled \"Quantenzahlen, Wirbelring-Atommodelle und Heliu msechserring-Aufbauprinzip des Periodensystems der chemischen Elemente,\" a mind-twister that is no less impressive in English: \"A Quantum Number, Vortex Atom Model and Hexagonal-ring Construc tion Principle of the Periodic System of the Chemical Elements.\" Hilgenberg had developed the mathematics for a system of mo delling complete atoms according to vorticular rotational principles of the now long-discarded aether! The combined effect of these tw o papers and their mathematical and theoretical development allowed Hilgenberg to predict a number of effects completely at variance with relativistic physics, and long before similar observations in the la te 20th century began to signal significant problems w ith the relativistic-Big Bang cosmology, e.g., heterodyning effect s on light coming from a body moving toward the observer, or, to put it simpl y, why red-shift effects sometimes accompany bodies moving toward an observer rather than away from one. Under Hilgenberg's influence, Ca rl Friedrich Krafft took this \"vorticular quantum mechanics\" one step further, and posited atoms as essentially a geometric or topological construct of the aether that acted as \"ether pumps\", taking in or gi ving off energy based on the rotations of the va rious rings of dynamic aether around them. He developed this notion even furt her by positing various combinations of vorticular, rotating geometries as the basis 199"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"for the then known sub-atomic particles. Krafft, whose views were totally eclipsed by war's end with the victory of the Allies - which likewise might be seen as a victory of relativity - was left to self- publish his works in this strang e world of \"non-linear physics\", which were duly and promptly i gnored by the more conventionally minded linear physics of relativity and its proponents. 3 But is there any indication that all this theory about the vorticular and rotational aspect of a dynamic aether was ever pursued beyon d the stage of theory? Indeed there is, but it requires a detour by way of a bit of aerodynamics, courtesy of Renato Vesco once again. B. Disks, Boundary Layer, And Turbines Vesco maintained an unusual a pproach throughou t the various reprintings of his book, namely, th at German experimentation with disk shaped aircraft actually began as an experiment to transform the entire lift surface into the intake vent for a jet turbine. That is to say, on his view, the earliest German \"saucers\" were nothing more than standard suction aircraft, though admittedly of very unusual design. These experimental aircraft were further the offshoots of German experiments to suction th e boundary layer from the lift surfaces of aircraft. The \"boundary layer\" is that small layer - only a few molecules of air thick - of air that \"sticks\" to a lift surface, such as a wing, and, as an aircraft move s faster, this layer increases the drag on the lift surface, and ther efore weakens its efficiency and requires more energy to move the craft. As speed increases and depending on the configuration of th e wing itself, great turbulence can build up behind the wing as the result of the thickening of the boundary layer, increasing the aer odynamic resistance. \"It seems clear, therefore, even to a layman in aeronautics that the objective should be to move the point of tran sition as far to the rear of the 3 No amount of explaining, however, ca n seem to quell the anti-relativist side of things for the simple feet that in most respects the theory of General Relativity has enormous predictive power, and therefore, scientific value and credibility.

This is especially true in high speed flight, since the power required increases at about the cube of the speed.\" 4 Thus, prior to the war British, American, and particularly German researchers concentrated their efforts to deve lop various methods to deal with this problem. Various methods were tried and pursued during the war, including the use of micro-por ous sinterized metal called \"Luftschwamm \" (literally, \"air sponge) as both a lift surface and an intake vent for a jet turbine. The goal was simply to suction the boundary layer itself from the lif t surface, thereby dramatically decreasing drag, and increasing effi ciency and performance at high speed. According to Vesco, the Ge rmans gradually reached some intriguing conclusions in these experiments: The first was that it was not advantageous to transform ordinary aircraft into planes with a co ntrolled boundary layer because the suction principle was deprived of its best attributes and the difficulties of construction did not compensate for the limited advantages.... In addition, it was demonstrated that inasmuch as they were planning a special turbine-powered project, it would have been advantageous to combine the two m echanisms into a single whole by feeding the turbine with air taken from the wing orifices instead of by the means of the usual forward-ram air intakes. ....It seems, in fact, that by reworking the old experiments on \"potential frictionless current,\" the German technical experts may in the final days have succeeded experimentally in reducing aerodynamic friction on appropriately shaped bodies to very low values. 5 This idea had also occurred to th e British as well, but apparently the Germans had had no little su ccess in combining micro-porous \"sinterized\" air permeable lift su rfaces and turbine intakes, for a British postwar report, \"A.R.C . No. 9672: Notes on German Theoretical Work on Porous Sucti on - all the notes taken from the examination of German researches on porous materials (for which a 4 Vesco and Childress, Man-Made UFOs: 50 Years of Suppression, pp. 188-189. 5 Ibid., p. 193, emphasis in the original. 201"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"special team of investigators ha d been formed),\" were compared with similar British work done duri ng the war. The report, as Vcsco notes, \"still bears the label 'top secret.\" 6 What the Germans were apparently trying to do was simply build a disk-shaped aircraft, t h e entire surface of which was both the turbine intake, as well as the lift surface. This was, so to speak, the \"Mark I\" flying saucer: a standard suction aircraft, albeit, with a very unconventional lift surface, which was one and the same as its fuselage and air intake. However, Vesco maintained more in his book, namely, that the \"Foo Fighters\" - the strange balls of light that Alli ed and German pilots began to see accompanying th eir formations near the end of the war - were in fact an even more revolutionary radio-controlled anti-aircraft weapon, used to ja m Allied radars via very small, ceramic-cased miniaturized klystr on tubes, or to actually down Allied planes by firing ionized gases to short out, or even explode, an aircraft's ignitions or engines. In this respect, Vesco's assertions became more detailed, and simulta neously, more fanciful and easily dismissed. For one thin g, Vesco claimed that these were secret German anti-aircraft weapons, a claim that seemed to fly in the face of absurdity, since the official history of their sighting never associated the loss of any Allied aircraft with them. In fact, they appeared quite harmless according to all standard versions of the history of their appearance. Once again, only recently has the German perspective on \"Foo Fighters\" been verified by a Fe bruary 1945 report called \"An Evaluation of German Capabilities in 1945.\" This report, among other things, lists a Ge rman \"phoo bomb\" as well as atom bombs. Miniaturized klystron tubes, as well as German advances in silicon and germanium crystals, two elemen ts essential in the making of semiconductors which in turn are th e basis of the transistor, were actually under deve lopment as well. 7 Most of this research was burned by the Germans in the face of the Allied advance into the Reich, and the rest fell into American hands. 6 Vesco and Childress, op. cit., pp. 212-213. 7 Henry Stevens, Hitler's Flying Saucers: A Guide to German Flying Disks of the Second World War, p. 75. 202"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"And this raises a significant problem, for the miniaturization of the klystron tube to a scale in some cases only a tenth as large as similar tubes in the A llied inventory, raises the specter of how far the Germans actually progressed in their semiconductor research. In any case, as researcher Henry Stevens notes, this bit of information provides the \"missing provenance\" to the origins of the transistor, and \"explodes an argument made by th e late Col. Philip J. Corso\" that \"transistors were, at least in part, based upon alien technology.\" 8 This will not be the first time we encounter a potential \"German problem,\" as opposed to an \"E.T. problem,\" with respect to Roswell and other celebrated crash recovery accounts. One of the unusual aspects of Vesco's claims, and again, one that brought him under a certain amount of criticism, was his claim that an Italian engineer and turbine specialist named \"Bellonzo\" had been involved in the Nazi saucer projects. As no Bellonzo could be found, this assertion wa s apparently a fabric ation, until one Dr. Giuseppi Belluzo, indeed a speciali st in steam turbines, showed up to corroborate the stor y. Why is this significant? Because in 1980 the German magazine Neue Presse featured an article about the Germ an fluidics engineer Heinrich Fleissner. Fleissner was an engineer, designer and advisor to what he calls a \"Flugscheibe\" project based at Peenemuende during the war. It is interesting to note that Fleissner 's area of expertise, fluidics, is exactly the specialty involved in investigating problems with boundary layer flow. Fleissner reports that the saucer with which he was involved would have been capable of speeds up to 3,000 kilometers per hour within the earth's atmosphere and up to 10,000 kilometers per hour outside the earth's atmosphere. He states that the brains of the developmental people were found in Peenemuende under the tightest secrecy. .... What is of most interest to us here are three facts. First, that Fleissner worked at Peenem uende on a flying saucer project. Second, that a hint of this design has survived to this day. Third, the surviving design can be linked to photographic evidence of German saucer, circa World War Two. 9 8 Stevens, Hitler's Flying Saucers, p. 75. Stevens of course is referring to Corso's well-known and controverisal book, The Day After Roswell. 9 Ibid., p. 90. 203"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Let us pause to note that accordin g to Fleissner th ere was a saucer project at Peenemunde and that it ap parently involved the \"suctioned boundary layer\" concept we have already discussed. As we shall see, there will be an o dd, little noticed connection that might corroborate the existence of this program when we examine the Roswell crash in the next part of this book. Stevens continues with his summar y of Fleissner: Almost ten years after the war, on March 28, 1955, Heinrich Fliessncr filed a patent application with the United States Patent Office for a flying saucer (Patent number 2,939,648).... The engine employed by Fleissner rotated around the cabin on the outside of the saucer disk itself. It was set in motion by star ter rockets...The difference is that this engine was really a form of ram-jet engine. It featured slots running around the periphery of the saucer into which air was scooped. The slots continued obliquely right through the saucer disk so that jet thrust was aimed slightly downward and backward from the direction of rotation. Within the slots, fuel injectors and a timed ignition insured a proper power curve which was in accordance with the speed and direction of the saucer much like an automobile's fuel injection is timed to match the firing of the spark plugs. Steering was accomplished by directing the airflow using internal channels contained an rudder and flaps which ran alongside the central cabin. The cabin itself was held stationary or turned in the desired direction of flight using a system of electromagnets and servo-motors coupled with a gyroscope. 10 But Fleissner was not awarded his patent until five years later! The question is, why the delay? One reason for the delay is that the joint Canadian-American suction-saucer project, Project Silverbug, was also under development at the same time. Fleissner's patent was incomparably superior. At about the same time as his patent was granted the Canadian-Ameri can project was canceled. 11 But why was the Fleissner design superi or? Perhaps because the patent detailed the way the earlier Peenemunde sa ucer was able to function both inside and outside the atmosphere. In short, the power plant for the unusual ram-jet was capable of utilizing both jet 1 0 Stevens, Hitler's Flying Saucers, p. 90. 1 1 Ibid., p. 92. 204"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"f u e l for in-atmosphere flight, and once outside the atmosphere, the suction vents could be closed, and the fuel shifted to a mixture of liquid oxygen and hydrogen. \"Is this performance enough to impress the U.S. Air Force and civ ilian population of the late 1940s and early 1950s? The answer is clearly in the affirmative.\" 12 But what has this to do with an Italian steam turbine expert? Very simply, because when the craf t was in its \"rocket mode, when the saucer is burning only liqui d oxygen and liquid hydrogen, the products of this combustion are only heat and wate r. Another way to say heat and water is steam.\" 13 And steam, of course, hisses, a sound sometimes associated with close observation of UFOs. From this simple, though unconventional, configuration of known technologies, the German s would have progressed by elementary science and engineerin g principles to the next, \"Mark II,\" stage. How could such a craft's range be extended? The answer - one which likewise occurred to American p hysicist Thomas Townsend Brown - was that the jet turbine itself could be coupled with a large electrical generator to become a source of electrical power. With sufficient supe r-cooling (remember Nowak's \"molecular bomb\"?) and sufficient electrical charge, even inert gases such as nitrogen, which forms the bulk of the earth's atmosphere, could be burned as fuel. Of course, while the theory is simple the engineering is monstrously difficult, but the advantages were plainly to be seen, \"A saucer which could gather its fuel along the way has one obvious advantage. It could stay aloft for days if not weeks.\" 14 The next step, \"Mark I II,\" was imply to apply already existing German re search in nuclear powered \"conventional\" craft to this unconventional airframe. 15 Was such a saucer ever actually built? An article by Jim Wilson in the November 2000 issue of Popular M echanics discloses a project to design a chemical-nuclear powered saucer craft for long-duration orbital missions, a craft tipped with nuclear missiles and bombs.

What happens therefore, when these conventional technologies are not only combined in unconventional ways, but with the very unconventional physics that the Germans may have been devel oping? With this question, we are at the entrance into the \"Mark IV\" saucer prototypes, saucers based on combinations of turbines, vorticular physic s, and field propulsion.

Viktor Schauberger: Rotational Physics and Extreme Temperature Gradients The story of Viktor Schauberger, an Austrian forester and naturalist, is well-know n to any who have investigated claims of Nazi development of fl ying saucers. Yet, ther e are aspects of this story that have escape d even Nick Cook or meticulous researchers such as Henry Stevens. These aspects concern three key areas: (1) His concern with \"implosion\", extremes of temperature gradients, and vorticular mo tion were coupled with his detailed study of ancient mathematical doctrines and \"occulted physics\" within an cient doctrines and philosophical texts. In shor t, Schauberger was the ideal candidate, from the SS's point of view, to lead a project involved with areas of physics and esoteric systems that were central to the SS ideology; (2) His project was directly connect ed to the SS and, much to Schauberger's own moral disgust and distaste, was forced to use slave labor from con centration camps. Thus, what many have missed, is that this fact places Schauberger's saucer project firmly within the orbit of the Kammlerstab; 16 Stevens, Hitler's Flying Saucers, p. 106. 206"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"(3) Schauberger r e a l i z e d t h e implications for his \"implosion\" physics were such that a \"super-super bomb\" of unbelievable power could be constructed. This means, in effect, that quirky though some of Schauberger's terminology and ideas might seem from a conventional physics standpoint - he was, after all, a \"naturalist\" and self- taught physicist and inventor - his ideas were well within the framework being developed in quantum mechanics and the unusual \"aether vortex\" theories of physicists and engineers like Hilgenberg, Krafft, or even the great Gerlach himself. In a nutshell, Schauberger's theories bring us to the very edge of what appear to be a wartime effo rt - a well funded, and deeply black effort - on the part of the SS to understand the relationship of the zero point energy, rotating fields, and gravity. 1. His Basic Conceptions Schauberger began his little known and quite unconventional career as an \"unorthodox physicist\" as a forest er for the Austrian government. One observation - a breathtakingly simple one - launched him on his career. One day Schauberger observed a trout in a clear, fast moving stream. Th e trout was stationary in the swift current, using a minimum of effort to remain in place: a flick of a fin here, a small movement of the tail there. As he pondered this well- known, but little understood fact, he ca me to the realization that the trout was using far less energy to remain motionless than conventional physics woul d allow. After all, th e fish should have been swimming like crazy just to st and still. But th at was not all. Schauberger then wond ered how the trout, again with so little apparent effort and expenditure of work, could suddenly leap from the water several feet, and land upstream against the current. Schauberger decided to study the phenomenon. What he found was the fish seemed somehow to employ extremes of temperature to achi eve their stationary place, or, conversely, to leap suddenly from the water against a swift current. 207"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"As molecules \"condensed\", they cooled, and gave off energy in the form of heat. But Schauberger added one factor that brought him into the realm of the unconventional vorticular physics that Hilgenberg, Gerlach, Krafft, and others in Germany were developing: whenever such \"condensing\" took place naturally in nature, it was accomplished by a sp iraling motion toward the center of a vortex, a form of motion he called \"implosion.\" Schauberger speculated that, by delibe rately forcing matter into such a motion, by deliberately compressing it via a spiral vorticular motion, matter might reach such a state that particles in atoms becomes \"unglued\" and transform into a new form of energy. In short, what Schauberger was proposing was a form of cool plasma, brought about by vorticular motion. 17 Schauberger supplemented this idea with all manner of study of natura l examples of these types of spirals, well known to mathematic ians to incorporate the Golden Section, and the Fibon acci sequence. In his own quirky way and terminology, Schauberger was talking about \"cold plasmas\" and cold fusion, concepts well in ad vance of any physics of his day, conventional or otherwise. These ideas led Schauberger - like his more orthodox quantum mechanics contemporaries - to the conclusion th at energy was relatively free and limitless if one only knew how to tap into it. And with extreme temperature gradients, rotating media and compression of matter to an intense plasma state - Schauberger thought he knew how. These idea s quickly brought him to the attention of a fellow Austrian who was interested in energy independence for his own reasons: Adolf Hitler. In what surely must be one of the most surreal meetings ever held between an \"orthodox mainstream physicist\", a political leader, and an \"alternative sc ience\" proponent, Scha uberger was invited - summoned would be a more approp riate word - to Berlin for a private audience with Reichskanz ler Hitler. A measure of the importance that Hitler attached to this meeting may be gleaned from the fact that once Schauberger had accepted Hitler's 17 Stevens, Hitler's Flying Saucers, p. 121; Callum Coats, Living Energies: Viktor Schauberger's Brilliant Work with Natural Energy Explained, pp. 30- 66. 208"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"invitation, his diplomatic papers were expedited in one day. 18 Call u m Coats then describes the surreal meeting: Hitler....greeted him warmly as a fe llow countryman, telling him that he had studied all the reports about Viktor's work thoroughly and was very impressed with what he had learned. Thirty minutes had been allocated for the discussions, which Prof. Max Planck had been requested to attend as scientific adviser shortly before he was rudely deposed from his position as Privy Councilor. This exchange of views eventually lasted 1 1/2 hours, during which Schauberger explained the destructive action of contemporary technology and its inevitable consequences. He contrasted this with all the processes of natural motion and temperature, of the vital relation between trees, water and soil productivity, indeed all the things he considered had to be thoroughly understood and practised in order to create a sustainable and viable society. When Viktor had finished his explanations, Max Planck, who had remained silent, was asked his opinion about Viktor's natural theories. His response was the remarkable and revealing statement that 'Science has nothing to do with Nature.' 19 Nothing further came of the meet ing, but the lecture had undoubtedly made an impression on Hitler, if not on Max Planck. It was in 1943 that Sc hauberger's formal c ontact and work on a saucer project for the SS began. (Schauberger) was declared fit for active duty and was inducted into the Waffen-SS, very much under duress. He came under the control of Heinrich Himmler, who forced him into research to develop a new secret weapon. Provided with suitable accommodation at Schloss Schonbrunn, the nearby Mauthausen Concentration Camp to supply the workforce of prisoner engineers, Viktor was threatened with his life if he did not comply with orders and carry out this research. In spite of these threats, however, Viktor put his foot down and demanded from the SS Command the absolute right to select the various engineers he needed. He further demanded that any technicians he chose were to be removed entirely from the camp, fed properly, dressed in normal civilian clothes and billeted in civilian 1 8 Callum Coats, Living Energies, p. 8. 1 9 Ibid., pp. 8-9. 209"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"accommodation, otherwise they would be unproductive. As he explained, people who l i v e in fear of their lives and under great emotional stress could work neither consistently nor creatively. Surprisingly the SS agreed and so Viktor selected somewhere between twenty and thirty engineers, craftsmen and tradesmen front Mauthausen, to be accommodated in various houses near the plant. 20 It is to be noted that the inducti on of Schauberger into the SS, t h e use of concentration camp labor, and the SS's behavior in allowing Schauberger fall latitude to pursu e his project in the manner he wished, even as regards the hou sing of the concentration camp workers, are all classic signature s of Kammler's \"think tank\" group. In short, this is very strong ev idence that Schauberger's team was one component of the Kammlerstab. Few of the scientists and engineers Schauberger collected for his project understood what he was trying to construct. And it is difficult to get a measure of just exactly what Schauberger did accomplish, since all of his wartime German patents have simply disappeared, no one knows where. 2. His Disks and Turbines It seems certain, however, that Schauberger's disks approached the boundary between the German \"suction\" saucers and field propulsion craft proper , as a glance at Schauberger's own postwar reconstructions of what these craf t looked like will demonstrate. A postwar design exists for a home electricity generator based upon a simple, though quite unusual, jet turbine. This \"Tornado Generator\" employed a turbine that in turn was made up, not of blades, but of hollow, antelope-horn-like spiraling tubes. Once air was forced into this turbine and its tubes, it was then compressed, via the spiraling motion of the air through the horns, until it escaped, expanded, and pushed the whole tube-turbine assembly along. This expanding air was then recirculated to th e turbine, where it was again compressed, and so on. 20 Coats, Living Energies, p. 11. 210"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" Needless to say, the construction of such a complicated turbine would have required the most exacting machining and engineering skills.

Even more so than the bomb. Unlike the bomb, however, this was a secret that had held for more than 50 years. Days after the end of the war, US intelligence agents found Schauberger in Leonstein and appreh ended him. Exactly as the (Nazi UFO) Legend had it, the agents, wh o were almost certainly Counter- intelligence Corps - the same outfit that had detained and interrogated Skoda's director Wilhelm Voss - were remarkably well informed about his entire operation. It was as if, Schauberger noted later, someone had guided them directly to him. 21 Very few people would have been in position to familiarize US intelligence with the parameters of Schauberger's research or its exact location, but one of them woul d most certainly have been SS ()bergruppenfuhrer Hans Kammler. Cook continues: That night, back at my hotel, I applied myself to a study of the Schauberger effect that had been written up by a researcher called Callum Coats. I had picked up a copy of one of his books at the Schauberger institute. In it, there was a description of what happened when a Repulsine was rotated at 20,000 rpm. The high rotation speeds appeared to cause the air molecules passing through the turbine to pace so tightly together that th eir molecular and nuclear binding energies were affected in a way that triggered the anti-gravity effect. 'A point is reached where a larg e number of electrons and protons with opposite charges and directions of spin are forced into collision and annihilate with one another,' Coats wrote. 'As lower rather than higher forms of energy and the basic building blocks of atoms, they are upwardly extruded as it were out of the physical and into virtual states.' Virtual states? What the hell did that mean? ....'I stand face to face with the apparent \"void\", the compression of dematerialization that we are wont to call a \"vacuum\",' Schauberger had written in his diary on 14 August 1936. 'I can now 21 Nick Cook, The Hunt for Zero Point, p. 220. 215"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"see that we are able to create anything we wish for ourselves out of this \"nothing\".' 22 That is, the vacuum for Schauberg er and his rotati onal, vorticular concepts, was but another \"super compressed\" and \"supercooled\" state of matter. In any case, one test of such a Schauberger saucer allegedly took place in Prague in 1945, breaking loose from its test anchor, it quickly flew upward hitting the r oof of the building. Given the extraordinary latitude accorded to Schauberger by his SS controllers - doubtless up to and including Kammler himself - it is evident that \"the German scientific leadership was interested in implosion and in what Schauberger had to teach them but they did not necessarily want to be limited by the use of air to achieve these results. Instead, they may have wanted to use Schauberger ideas but actuating these principles with electronic components.,\" 23 This will lead, as we shall shortly see, to the most fantastic projects of all in the Kammler Group's esoteric think tank. Whatever can be said, Schauberger's unorthodox approach to jet turbine design certainly, and by all accounts, was wildly su ccessful, so much so that he became the object of a curious attempt by some Americans to develop the idea. 3. Implosion and the USA As was seen, Viktor Schaube rger and his unorthodox ideas came to the attention of US intelligence at the end of the war. And thus was launched the strangest ep isode in Schauberger's already strange career, the \"American Episode\". 24 The difficulties 22 Nick Cook, The Hunt for Zero Point, p. 221. 23 Stevens, Hitler's Flying Saucers, p. 128, emphasis added. 24 The best and most complete history of this episode is in Callum Coats' Living Energies, pp. 15- 28. My treatment of it here relies upon Coats, with the exception of my interpretation of its significance. Coats himself notes that the data for this period is precariously slim: \"Before embarking on this last and lamentable chapter in Viktor Schauberger's life, I would like to state at the outset that significant and verifiable detail about it is extremely difficult to ascertain, mainly because all those involved, with the exception of Karl 216"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Schauberger cxperienced during his st ay in America were similar to those he encountered first in Austria, and then later during his famous visit with Hitler and Planck. First, being self-taught, he did not possess the physicist's technica l language with which to express his ideas. Thus, he invented his own technical language, and often t he translation between the two wa s difficult. Second, Schauberger having already witnessed the theft and disappearance of his patents by the Nazis, was understandably reluctant to be completely forthcoming to his American \"fri ends.\" Finally, Schauberger no longer had working prototypes of any of the devices he had built. 25 Schauberger was first brought to the attent ion of a group of private American \"investors\" by one Karl Gerchsheimer, who emigrated from Germany in 1922, ev entually settli ng in Texas and marrying an American wife in 1937. According to Coats, it appears that Gerchsheimer became involved with the US military during World War Two in its Counter-int elligence Corps, eventually becoming the man in charge of all transport, logistics, and accommodation for the American army of occupation in Germany after the war. He returned to th e USA in 1950 a nd established a metal fabrication company, manufact uring a number of items for NASA under contract. 26 In this capacity Gerc hsheimer befriended wealthy American Philadelphia steal magnate Robert Donner. Gerchsheimer's familiarity with Schauberger's work, doubtless acquired during his Count er-intelligence years in Germany, and his disenchantment with Dr. Von Bra un's rocket progra m, led him to propose to Donner that they visit Schauberger in Germany personally, to offer him the opportunity of pr ivate development of his \"implosion\" ideas. Gerchsheimer sold the project to Dormer - an intense patriot - by maintaining it would ensure American technological dominance for decad es to come. A meeting in Gerchsheimer with whom I spent two days, have passed away in the interim. In whatever information is available concerni ng this tragedy, there is a profusion of conflicting statements, interpretations and timetables which, 37 years after the event, makes the unraveling of what precisely took place in this, for all concerned, abortive endeavour rather problematic.\"(p. 15) 25 Ibid., p. 15. 26 Ibid., p. 16. 217"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Bavaria was linally arranged between Gerchsheimer, Walter Schaubcrger (Viktor's son), and Viktor. Eventually squeezing out the European competition for hi s ideas with promises of large funding, Gerchsheimer wa s able to persuade Viktor to come to America. As part of the contract, negotiated for an American stay of three months, it was agreed that \"Walter Schauberger, a physicist and mathematician, was to accompany his father and would be expected to stay for a year in order to assist in the scientific interpretation of Viktor's ideas for which there was often no recognized scient ific terminology.\" 27 Schauberger also stipulated that his trusted m achinist, Alois Renner, who had collaborated with him in the constr uction of several of his devices, be brought to the USA as well. Gerchsheimer was of the opinion, however, that Walter Schauberger \"neither knew nor understood much about his fa ther's theories.\" 28 Eventually, the two Schaubergers flew to Dallas, and then were driven to Sherman, Texas, where they were virtually inte rred as the \" house guests\" of Donner associate Harald W. Totten on his ranch. Gerchsheimer quickly became disenchanted with Schauberger's ideas, which appeared to him to be increasingly so much gobbledygook. Having communicated these concerns to Robert Donner, who became concerned fo r the success of his project, Donner flew to Brookhaven's National atomic Research laboratories to seek expert scientific opinion. He secured the services of a technician who also spoke German, Eric A. Boerner, who was sufficiently familiar w ith the terminology of nuclear physics \"to be able to translate and transmit any information to the scientific evaluators that the Schaubergers might provide.\" 29 Viktor Schauberger spent about 10 days from August 20th to August 31st writing repor ts to Boerner. He ha d been instructed to write them in his own words, wi thout regard to attempt to use \"proper\" scientific te rminology. Because of the actual physical distance between the Schaubergers and Eric Boerner, and the intermediatorship of Gerchsheimer, the Schaubergers gained the 27 Coats, Living Energies, p. 18. 28 Ibid, p. 19. 29 Ibid., p. 22. 218"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"impression that it was Boerner himself who headed an important particle accelerator project then u nderway at Brookhaven. And this in turn magnified their fears about the possible motivations behind the sudden American interest in their \"implosion\" concepts. Walter Schauberger admitted that in the process of producing their reports, it dawned on them that a bomb could possible be produced through implosion that was magnitudes more powerful than the hydrogen bomb. Assuming Boerner to be more influential than he was, Viktor and Walter became convinced that all the information they were supplying to him was being passed directly to the U.S. government and the military. 30 While Coats himself downplays th is potentiality, it is worth recalling that a similar \"compres sion-decompression\" principle lay behind the \"molecular\" bomb of Dr. Nowak, and hence, their concerns may have come less from a misunderstanding of Boerner's role, and more from an acquainta nce with the work being done by the SS in Nazi Germany. In any cas e, I do not believe it is entirely fair to the Schaubergers to discount the possibility that the whole \"private funding\" venture vi a Robert Donner and Karl Gerchsheimer was not an operation designed to place into the hands of the US military and its re search facilities the fundamental outlines of Schauberger's concepts. In any case, a meeting was held on the Totten Ranch in early September 1958. Present were the two Schaubergers, Robert Donner, Boerner, and possibly Vi ktor Schauberger's machinist, Alois Renner. Based principally on the reports he had received, Boerner reported to th e group that Project impl osion was \"a viable proposition.\" Boerner believed that \"the solution of the problem of energy lay in the prope r interpretation of Ma x Planck's equation E=hv, formulated in 1900, and the Freidric h Hasenohrl-Albert Einstein equation E=Mc 2 .\" 31 Doubtless Boerner had in mind a 30 Coats, Living Energies, p. 23. 31 Ibid., p. 23.

Donne r essentially held the two Austrians hostage until Viktor signed a contract handing over all of his ideas, inventions, and conceptions to the Donner-Gerchsheimer consortium. Only with consider able pressure was Donner even persuaded to provide Viktor with a German translation! Coats himself states I have studied this document myself and it does state in quite unequivocal terms that not only were all Viktor's models, sketches, prototypes, reports and other data to become the sole property of the Donner-Gerchsheimer consortium, but that Viktor was to commit himself to total silence on anything connected with implosion thereafter.... The deplorable upshot of all this, however, is that all Viktor's models, prototypes, drawings, detailed data, including Professor Popel's original report implying what might be termed \"negative Friction\" was an actuality, have remained the possession of the Donner-Gerchsheimer consortium. That this report was actually part and parcel of this project is confirmed by Viktor's reference to it in one of his reports to Boerner dated 23/24 August 1958. 33 What does all this mean? For one thing, it means that during the precise period that Ni ck Cook notes that al l references to anti- gravity research began to disappear in the British and American Press, an American industrialist, with obvious tie s to the defense and nuclear research agencies of the USA, ha d successfully obtained all of the pape rs of one of Nazi Ge rmany's most deeply classified research projects scientists. For another, it seems to masses, rather than simply a lower case \"m\", which stands simply for mass. The point is picky, but important, as the mass difference as Einstein formulated it is crucial to the point he is developing in Special Relativity. 32 Coats, Living Energies, pp. 24-25 contains a synopsis of this rather remarkable idea.

As we shall see, there is every indication that these ideas themselves were put to the test. Before we turn to that however, it is necessary to examine yet another fantastic aspect of Nazi Science: the \"Death Ray.\" D. \"Death Rays \": An Unusual In stallation at th e University of Heidelberg During World War One, as is well known, Nicola Tesla approached first the US, and then European military establishments with the idea for a \"death ray\", a high energy beam capable of melting \"airplane motors\" at so me distance.

Similar \"Buck Rogers\" type gadgetry delig hted movie goers in Britain, Germany, France, and Italy before the Second World War. Then, as the Nazi UFO Mythos emerged, astonishing and specific claims began to be advan ced, again by the same circle of a few disenchanted postwar Nazi sy mpathizers, of astounding beam weapons, of Motorsto ppmittel (Means to Stop Motors), a device that resembles modern electromagn etic pulse weapons designed to knock out electronic circuitry, of electromagnetic rail guns, and of a mysterious weapon the German s were working on called a Kraftstrahlkanone, a \"Strong Ray Canon\".

An experimental, and highly theo retical and mathematical paper entitled \"On the Existence of Undistorted Progressive Waves (UPWs) of Arbitrary Speeds 0<v< oo in Nature,\" by Waldyr A Rodrigues Jr. and Jian-Yu Lu was published in October of 1997. Investigating a class of Undistorted Waves, i. e., a class of wave forms that do not diminish in fo rm or force over distance, they show that various solutions for th ese waves can be found within the standard equations for such waves. 35 If this paper were merely another mathematical swipe at rela tivity - demonstr ating solutions to certain equations that the \"relativity police\" would issue a speeding ticket for - then it would be easily dismissible. Unfortunately, the authors' main points are not the abstruse mathematical demonstrations and proofs, but rather, a method for generating such waves. First noti cing that solutions for Maxwell's equations in a waveguide had both subluminal and superluminal solutions, 36 they went on to propose a simple method for generating and for measuring the velocities of such wave structures. The method was called \"Finite Aperture Approximation,\" basically, a method of squeezing acoustic or longitudinal waves through a very small hole, and observing the waveform interference pattern that emerged on the other side, and calc ulating the velocity, not of the wave, but of the interference patt ern itself. If one knows the radius of the aperture and the strength and frequency of the pulse being squeezed through it, one knows the approximate depth of the Finite Aperture Approximation's resultin g wave interference pattern. 37 35 I.e., the scalar homogeneous wave equation, the Klein-Gordon equation, the Maxwell equations, and the Dirac and Weyl equations have such solutions, even in the vacuum.

There is indeed some indication that the Germans were involved with extensive research into \"Tes la\" technology a nd weaponry and other exotic particle beam technology at the University of Heidelberg. As Mayer and Mehner report, there is in available documentation that some type of atomic research was being conducted at Ludwigshafen by none other than I.G. Farben. But this research \"had in reality more to do with the development of the so-called 'death rays'.\" 42 In a file dated Dece mber 1, 1944 on this research, it was noted that the work force was moved from Ludwigshafen to Heidelberg in July of 1943. 43 This facility in Heidelberg wa s completely underground, being some 50 meters long a nd 25 meters wide, with a roof from 8 to 10 meters high, of .75 and 1 meter thickness. The entire bunker complex, as detailed in the diagram on the next page, consisted of a large parabolic reflector made of quartz, a \"polytron,\" a power circuit running the circ umference of the bunker, a storage area for various electrical equipment behi nd the quartz reflector, a generator and a transformer, a \"stand\" on which various targets for disintegration were placed, and a control-observati on booth to the side of the stand. The quartz para bolic reflector was approximately one centimeter thick. 44 An American intelligence report declassified only in 1998 described the experiments conduc ted with this and similar apparatus as follows: Experiments: The experiments involved a large, elaborate atom- smashing apparatus, the main features of which were four \"Spruehpole\" (positive) and one \"Fangpol\" (negative), each about 6 m high. Liberated protons were conveyed through a quartz tube to the Spruehpole, from which they were \"fired\" at an object placed on a 42 Mayer and Mehner, Die Atombombe un d das Dritte Reich, p. 73, my translation. 43 Ibid. 44 Ibid., p. 75. 225"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"quartz plate up to 800 m distant.

The water disappeared in two tenths of a second. The most spectacular experiment was conducted early April 1944, when some 75 rats were made to disappear in the same way. The experiment was photographed from the quartz-enclosed observation tower, and PW claims there was no trace of smoke or flame, nor did any ashes remain on the iron plate. His explanation of this apparent violation of the laws of physics is that the rats were somehow reduced to a gas, which was absorbed by the iron plate. PW's Evaluation: PW doubts that the principle involved in the experiments described above could be adapted to military use in less than two years. The apparatus is extremely complicated and far too large to be moved readily. 45 This experimentation sounds like a much more sophisticated high voltage direct current form of Tesla's direct current impulse experiments, as well as of the unusual accidental disappearances of tools and equipment in a US Na vy arc-welding facility that prompted an investig ation led by none othe r than T.

Indications of Zero Poin t Energy and Scalar Physics Experimentation There are a number of strong indications that the Germans were also experimenting with a variety of \"Tesla\" like devices that could, conceivably, also be called Zero Point Energy devices.

What is unusual is that Dr. Schumann was involved with secret German research on \"b atteries\" as late as 1943, and was subsequently brought to the United State as part of Operation Paperclip. It was this same Dr. Schumann who had noted in 1926 that Hans Coler's device exhibited \"no fault, hoax, or fraud on the part of its inventor.\" 48 Such \"free energy\" devices seemed to have come very early to the attention of the leadership of the Third Reich - witness the meeting between H itler, Planck, and Schauberger - and more especially to the attent ions of the SS. Devices involving pulsed Tesla coils, suspiciously similar to Tesla's own \"Impulse Magnifying Transformer\" were constructed. 49 One such device, the so-called Karl Schappeller Device, bears close scrutiny, since it bears rese mblances to another device found by Nick Cook and described in his Hunt for Zero Point. This odd device is described by Henry Stevens as follows: The Schappeller device is really composed of two separate units, the rotor and the stator. The stator is constructed as follows: its surface is round or ball-shaped, being composed of two half-shells of steel. These half-shells contain the internal structure and are air tight. Attached at each \"pole\" of each half-shell is an iron bar magnet, most of whose structure is internal. This means that the bulk of the magnet is inside the steel ball, one opposite the other. There is a space between the two bar magnets at the very center of the sphere. Insulation, a ceramic material, is placed on the inside of the steel ball leaving a hollow central area. W ithin this hollow area and around the space between the magnets are wound two internal coils. These originate at the bar magnet poles and each terminate at the center of the sphere with a connection leading out of the sphere to the rotor. These coils are composed of a hollow copper tube filled with a special and secret substance called the \"electret\". Upon leaving the sphere the electret filled copper tubes are replac ed by conventional copper wire. 48 Henry Stevens, Hitler's Flying Saucers, pp. 168-169. 49 Ibid., p. 168. 228"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"An electrical connection is made from the outside surface of one pole to one pole of a special type of battery which is grounded at the other pole...

It consists of carnauba wax and resin, perhaps also containing some beeswax. It was kept in a strong electrical field while baking slowly until it solidified. 50 Before proceeding to how this device alle gedly operated, it is important to note that this device bears strong resemblance in some respccts to a device called \"the Bell\" uncovered by Nick Cook and his researches, covered below. Moreover, we shall see how the sum total of all these strange coil s, spheres, and Bells will sound only familiar with devices alleged in two famous UFO crashes after the war.  50 Stevens, Hitler's Flying Saucers, p. 177. 229"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Returning now to the Schappeller device and its operation, for Schappeller the \"neutral area\", called the Bloch wall in a bar magnet, where the polarity is neith er \"north\" nor \"south\", was of great interest and significance to Schapeller. In the Schappeller device it is noted that the em pty area between the two magnets corresponds with this Bloch wall of neutrality. 51 It is this \"neutral area\" that is the area electrically charged by grounding when the device is put into operation. Th e result is a \"new kind\" of magnetism, a glowing magnetism in which, according to Schappeller's interpreters, electricity is stationary and magnetism is radiated. 52 At the Bloch Wall, \"the point of zero magnetism, no spin and magnetic reversal, is the poin t, so Schappeller theorized, energy enters and is radiated, in the form of gravity. Thus, according to one interpreter, gravity is a quadropole (four po les, rather than two poles), 360 degree radiated push. 53 But most astonishing about the little known Schappeller were his extraordinarily revolutiona ry, and prescient, views on thermodynamics, views that, in his day, would have had him roundly dismissed as a crackpot, but some 35 years later, became an exciting new area of physics and chemistry research. That area is non-equilibrium thermodynamics and systems kinetics. Schappeller had something to say about the Second Law of Thermodynamics. He said there was another and unknown thermodynamic cycle which runs opposite the Second Law. To name this idea we will call it \"Reverse Thermodynamics\". It is the reverse of the Second Law of Thermodynamics in that it leads to an increase in entropy. Not only is there an increase in order by there is an increase in cold! Schappeller....built his spherical device primarily to demonstrate the principles behind this Reverse thermodynamics. It was not designed as a practical machine. 54 Both Schappeller and Schauberge r were implying a physics based, not on inanimate lifeless processes, the physics we have come to 51 Stevens, Hitler's Flying Saucers, pp. 178-179. 52 Ibid., p. 179. 53 Ibid., p. 181. 54 Ibid., p. 182. 230"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"know, but on animate, creative pr ocesses hut Schappeller's views on ihcrmodynamics were truly revolutionary, and some decades ahead of their time, until Ilya Prigogine won the Nobel prize in chemistry precisely for his pion eering work on self-organizing principles evident in systems driven to a high state of non- equilibrium in 1977. 55 The new paradigm, a breathtakingly simple, and yet far-reaching one, was simply that equilibrium had been replaced with non-equilibrium in physics, especially for systems analysis. 56 1.

Whatever the truth of that hypothes is, it is perhap s interesting to note that the \"B rotherhood of the Bell\" seemed to exist for no other purpose than to suppress certain types of research, or at least, to keep it out of the public eye. It should come as no surprise, then, that there was a \"brotherhood of the Bell\" during World Wa r Two, for one of the most strange objects the German s were experimenting on was a device that was known simply as \"The Bell.\" So sensitive and secret was this device, that when it was evacuated from its underground secret laboratory in Lo wer Silesia prior to the Russian occupation of the area, the SS shot the approximately 60 scientists - doubtless on Kammler's orders - that were involved with this strange object. 58 The Bell consisted apparently of two counter-rotating cylinders, and resembled a Bell in its general shape. It stood approximately 12 to 15 feet high, and was approximately 9 to 12 feet in diameter. 59 I nto this device, an unknown pur plish metallic-liquid looking substance known only as \"Xerum 525\" or \"Serum 525\" was poured, apparently to be mechanic ally rotated at high speed, and possibly electrically ro tated as well, by the de vice. The result was that organic objects placed within the field of the Bell swiftly decayed without putrefaction, de composing into a black goo, and then finally, into dust, within a matter of hours, and not several weeks.

More recently, allegations have surfaced concerning the neutron emitting properties of so-called \"red mercury\" or mercury antimonate oxide, supposedly a source for detonating thermonuclear warheads without the necessity for detonating an atom bomb, and a powerful conventional explosive in its own right. Whatever the mysterious substance was, it seems clear that it was highly radioactive, and that th e Germans were subjecting it to extremely high mechanical and el ectrical rotations to study t h e resulting field effects, effects that Cook's adviso rs could only qualify as \"torsion\" fields. 62 These fields are thought by some contemporary physicists to have di rect relevance to the study of gravity, and of time. 63 Close to the Bell's underground testing bunker the Germans had built a large concrete henge-like structure, in the pillars of which were hi gh grade steel h ooks, an obvious testing frame for what must have been an extremely powerful propulsion device.

Betrayed even by Himm ler himself, who had secretly begun peace negotiations with th e western Allies through t h e Swedish government, and with one time designated \"Deputy Fuhrer\" and former party chief Rudolf Hess in a British prison cell, and his designated replacement Re ichsmarschall Goring claiming leadership in the chaos of the collapsing Reich to the quick denunciation by Hitler for treason, the Fuhrer reli nquished power before his suicide to an unlikely candidate, Grand Admiral Karl Donitz, who for a brief period of little more than a week, was Nazi Germany's second dictator before he ordered its armed forces to surrender. The selection of Donitz by Hitler is, for our purposes here, significant, for Donitz was in an usual position to coordinate the escape of fleeing Nazis to South America and other places via the new type XXI U-boats just entering service. But before proceeding to that story, it is worth looking at the Hitler and various other Nazi surviv al myths in a br oad overview, in order to have a basis on which to distinguish possible fact from deliberate myth and misinformation. For these various Nazi survival myths and legends, Hitler's survival is not so much a fact, as a grotesque parody of an icon, a disturbing possibility that hovers 1 John Toland, Adolf Hitler, Volume II, p. 1002. 238"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"over every version. For example, the stan dard view of Hitler committing suicide on April 10, 1945, is itself not without its own occult significance, for this is the date of the eve of a \"witches' sabbath,\" the Walpurgisnacht.

Hitler and his newly married mistress of many years, Eva (Braun) Hitler, both committed suicide together. These non-standard Hitler and Nazi survival myths run the whole spectrum, from fanciful and implausible stories of underground bases in the Canadian Arctic, or on Antarctica itself armed with some of the exotic weaponry described in the previous chapter, to more \"mundane\" and pl ausible stories of Nazi colonies in South America or secret we ather stations and commando teams operating in Greenland during the war, to th e well-known and best documented case, that of Operati on Paperclip, America's wholesale importation of Nazi scientists an d doctors after World War Two to assist the United States in continued covert development and research on a whole host of black pr ojects. In one rather interesting version of the Hitler survival myth, he and other Nazi bigwigs underwent plastic surgery before the end of the war, and were spirited off to Antarctica or Sout h America. One ve rsion of this myth even has an elderly Hitler mini stering to the poor as a Catholic priest! It is the thesis of th e next two chapters that there is some truth to some of these Nazi survival my ths, excluding the Hitler survival myth, and that all need to be vi ewed against the backdrop of the Nazis' own plans for postwar su rvival and continuance under a variety of fronts, organizations, or in concert wi th new \"host\" governments such as the United St ates or the various governments of Latin America, Africa, and th e Middle East. In this and the succeeding chapter, we will proceed by examining the more audacious survival myths, through some accounts of South American colonies, to Paperclip , and finally, to Bormann's top secret plan for postwar survival and economic resurgence.

Then in the remaining chapters of this book, we shall examine two well-known UFO \"crash and recovery\" cases for the indications that they may have been the recoveries of something truly extraordinary, but not extra-terrestrial. In this examination, it is crucial to bear in mind all the in formation of the preceding part of this book, for they have all led up to it. A. The Antarctic Survival Myth Of all the high-ranking German military leaders, Grand Admiral Karl Donitz is the most often ove rlooked, and yet he may have been the most crucial for the story of N azi survival and continued secret weapons research. After all, the s ecret preparations and voyage of the U-234 to Japan, with its precious cargo of enriched uranium and infrared fuses, could not lik ely have taken place without his express knowledge, participation, and authorization. Thus, outside Kammler's \"think tank\", he was perh aps the one military leader of a conventional service arm to know the full extent of Nazi Germany's actual advances in atom bomb and other nuclear research. Best known for his orchestrati on of the Nazi U-boat campaign against British, Canadian, and Ameri can shipping, his alleged role in the various survival myths is little known outside a sm all circle of UFOlogy and World War Two resear chers. And of all the Nazi military leaders, his selection by Adolf Hitler as the second Fuhrer of the Third Reich is, at best, pr oblematical, unless viewed in the light of these late wa r technology tr ansfers and esca ping Nazis. Why would Hitler have chosen Donitz, a World War One veteran of the High Seas Fleet of Kaiser Wilhelm, with the Kriegsmarine 's 240"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"well-known imperialist culture and leanings that he represented, to be his successor? A conventional answer is a fforded by the circumstances outlined above: betrayed on all sides - by Himmler and Goring themselves - a desperate Hitler reached out to what he thought was the most loyal conventional military service arm of the Wehrmacht, the Navy. But the survival mythos contributes a very different perspective from which to view Hitler's possible motivations. Donitz himself does nothing to allay those suspicions, either during or immediately after the wa r. According to Henry Stevens, who has almost single-handedly i nvestigated every lead - no matter how implausible the detail - of th e Nazi UFO and survival legends, Donitz on more than one occasio n alluded to the Navy's role in exotic secret weapons research and in the construction of very secret bases far from the Reich homeland. In 1943, the Grand Admiral is reported to have stated that \"the German submarine fleet is proud of having built for the Fuhrer, in another part of the world, a Shangri-La on land, an impregnable fortress.\" 2 Strange language for an admiral well-known for cold calculation in military strategy and tactics, and not well-known to be inclined to mystical statements. Then again, in 194 4, the Grand Admiral doled out a little more information: \"The Germ an Navy will have to accomplish a great task in the future. The Ge rman Navy knows all hiding places in the oceans and theref ore it will be very ea sy to bring the Fuhrer to a safe place should the necessity arise and in which he will have the opportunity to work out his final plans.\" 3 But it was Donitz's almost insane remarks at Nuremberg that seemed to point clearly to one of the two polar re gions as the \"site\" for these \"plans\". At Nuremberg he boasted of \"an invul nerable fortress, a paradise-like oasis in the middle of eternal ice.\" 4 Whatever the trustworthiness of 2 Henry Stevens, The Last Battalion and German Arctic, Antarctic, and Andean Bases (Gorman, California: The German Research Project, 1997), p. 2, citing Col.

U-530 surrendered at Mar del Plata, Argentina, on July 10, 1945, U- 977 surrendered at Mar del Plata, Argentina, on August 17, 1945. U- 465 was scuttled off the coast of Patagonia in August 1945. Another U-boat of unknown number surrendered to the Argentine Navy on June 10, 1945. 5 When the U-530 and U-977 surrendered so late after the European War's end, Allied intelligence was more than a little concerned, and dispatched agents to interrogate th e German officers. They certainly did not believe that the German captains had taken their ships on a South Atlantic excursion of three to four mont hs just to surrender to the Argentines, as Captain Sc haeffer of the U-977 and Captain Wermoutt of the U-530 actually, and apparently in all seriousness, stated. Stevens summarizes the Allie s' real concern - Nazi survival in no uncertain terms: The Allies first believed that th ese U-Boats had taken persons of special importance, perhaps even Adolf Hitler, from Germany to South America. In light of this possib ility both captains were held for questioning. Captain Schaeffer, who surrendered last, was taken to America for a month or so then to England for another period of questioning. Both captains maintained that there had been no persons of political importance deposited in South America. Eventually the captains were released although Sc haeffer found living in Occupied Germany intolerable and relocated to South America. Captain Schaeffer even went on to write a book explaining his voyage and actions. Unfortunately, nobody really believed Schaeffer. Bernhardt, who himself was aboard U-530, claims that American and British Intelligence had learned that U-530 and U-977 did visit Antarctica 5 Ibid., p. 48, citing Buechner, pp. 175-176. 242"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":" before landing in South America but the exact nature of their mission eluded them.6 A glimpse into this extraordinary mission and the high importance afforded by the German Navy High Command (the Oberkommando der KriegsMarine or OKM) to it can perhaps be afforded by a glance of the alleged performan ce characteristics of the U-530. In the spring of 1945, an old fa shioned type U- boat with the number 530 was dry-docked after being damaged by a freighter which had rammed it. As was typi cal for the Kriegsmarine, a new submarine, probably a type XXI or further development of it, was launched at approximately the sa me time, and was given the same service number, an obvious ploy to confuse Allied military intelligence. But why was the U-boa t that actually sailed to the South Atlantic and that later surre ndered to Argentina probably a type XXI or some derivative? Be cause Captain Wilhelm Bernhardt, a pen name of an actual crew member of Captain Wermoutt's U- 530, let out a significant piece of info rmation; he stated that her submerged speed was approximately 30 knots, an unheard of speed for a submerged submarine in that day. The only submarines in service in any navy in the world capable of th at performance at that time were the German type XXI U-boats. The type XXI U-boat, like most U-boats in th e German Navy by that time, was fitte d with the special schnorkel device that 6 Ibid., p. 51, ci ting Buechner, p. 232. 243"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"allowed its main diesel engines to op erate while submerged underwater. It is quite possible that these newer Type XXI U-boats also had the newer Schnorkels fitt ed with the spec ial anti-radar coatings examined in the previous part of this book. But the Type XXI was also outfitted with the special \"Walther \" turbine, an underwater jet\" device that utilized hydrogen peroxide that allowed great underwater cruisi ng speeds. In effect, these turbines were \"silent\" engines allowing great un derwater speeds for limited durations of time. Thus, the Ty pe XXI had brou ght submarine technology and warfare to a new and sophis ticated level by the war's end. But would even the Type XXI have been able to brave the North and then South Atlantic Oceans, by that point in the war all but Allied lakes? There is some indication that not only were they successful in doing so, but wildly so. In the previous part of this book mention was made of special new guidance systems the Germans had adapted to missiles, and torpedoes. These systems included wire-guidance, as well as magnetic proximity fuses. Stevens reports that on May 2, 1945, a flotilla of U-boats, many of them Type XXIs, carefully husbanded by Donitz at Kristiansand fjord in Norway, departed in a wolf pack for Iceland, making the traditiona l run through the straits between Iceland and Greenland. What happened next has been deleted from what passes as history, at least in the countries of the former Allied Powers. What happened was the last great sea battle of the Atlantic. The German U-boat convoy ran straight into an Allied naval battle formation. 7 The result was stunning. Using the new torpedoes... the Allied ships were totally annihilated. Apparently the Allies never quite realized what they had run into. Our only third-party report of the event was an article in a South American newspaper which learned of the event. A quote (sic) from the only survivor of the attack is often quoted by the underground German writers although this writer has not seen a copy of the newspaper: \"May God help me, may I never again encounter such a force\" - British destroyer captain. 7 The British consistently maintained a flotilla of destroyers, accompanied occasionally by heavier units of light and heavy cruisers, on station in these straits throughout the war. 244"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"This was reportedly carried in \"El Mercurio\", Santiago, Chile, and \"Der Weg\" a paper published by exiled Germans living in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 8 The use of new torpedoes - whether wire-guided, acoustic-seeking, or magnetic proximity-fused 9 - leads once again back to Karnrnler's \"think tank\" secret we apons empire. These to rpedoes, plus the high-submersible speeds and \"proto -stealth\" capabili ties of the Type XXI U-boats would have been more than a match for the British destroyers on station between Iceland and Greenland. But as we have previously no ted, the Coler co il came to the quick attention of the Kriegsmarine in the early days of the Third Reich, which immediately classified it at the highest level, and funded further research. It is not hard to understand the Kriegsmarine's interest in the Coler device. It is the perfect generator for submarine use. It produces no exhaust and burns no fuel. It could be linked directly to existing electric-drive vessels and run under water indefinitely. Did the Germans actually accomplish this? The underground German writers say that this indeed happened. This theme runs throughout the writing of Bergmann whose specialty is the link between German submarines and German flying saucers. 10 This is an incredible, if not outlandish, claim. Yet it is worth pondering for a moment. The Coler devices, developed in 1933, 11 and their unusual ability to transduce electrical power out of something were known to the Germ ans fully six years before the war had even started, and were developed in secret for twelve years after that (and then presumably by the Br itish for another twenty three years after that!). We do not know, of course, nor is the British Government saying (if indeed it knows), to what state the Germans brought this device, but what ever the state, they bad fully twelve years in which to do it.

In any case, the odd circumstances of the late-surrendering U- boats, not to mention the alleged naval debacle suffered by t h e British so late in the war when everything seemed - from a naval and military standpoint - so secure and safe, focused Allied and particularly American eyes quite quickly and forcefully on Antarctica. 12 Whatever the Allies learned, there was a sudden, intense interest in Antarctica. This interest was so strong that in 1946, as Allied troop were returning home from the War and all thoughts were turned to peacetime pursuits, the United States Government, under President Harry Truman, found it absolutely imperative that a full military expedition be mounted against Antarctica. This campaign was called Operation Highjump. 13 While the operation was billed in American newspapers, magazines and even the occasional newsreel as a mapping expedition, its actual military character is easily seen from a glance at its composition. Commanded by Ameri ca's premier polar explorer, Admiral Byrd, the flotilla included an aircraft escort carrier (the Philippines Sea), two seaplane carriers (the Pine Island and Curritich), two de stroyers (the Brownsen and Henderson), two escort ships (Yankee and Merrick) , two fueling ships (Canister and 1 2 It goes without saying that the high priority that the British Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee pl aced on recovering a Coler device and its inventor after the war tends to corroborate the notion that the British had learned the hard way that it had been brought to some state of practical use for submarine propulsion. 1 3 Stevens, op. cit., p. 51. 246"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Capacan), and a submarine (t he Sennet).

At a cost of some millions of Reichsmarks, the expedition was under the personal direction and mentorship of none other than Luftwaffe chief, Reichsmarschall Hermann Goring, 18 which leaves one to wonder what possible purpose Goring woul d have in sponsoring such an expedition. That it wa s military in nature s eems beyond doubt, for the Nazis spared no effort to outfit the expedition as thoroughly as possible. New canning techniques were invented for the food needed on the voyage from and back to Germany, and new clothing was designed, including allegedly a \"grey almost bullet proof seamless and metallic appearing suit...made of whale skin.\" 19 The inspiration for the expedition may have had hidden occult motivations as well, for the o ccult Thulegesellschaft or Thule Society subscribed to a Nordic Atlantis hidden beneath the polar ice, whence sprang, so the le gend goes, the Germanic race. 20 In any case, small teams of speci ally selected biologists and other scientists accompanied the expedition to run laboratory experiments on board the refurbished Schwabenland. 21 1 8 It is also to be noted that apparently the then Deputy Fuhrer and Party chief, Rudolf Hess, was also privy to whatever secret purpose and findings this expedition had.

All of this would seem to imply at a minimum that something was going on in Antarctica, and that someone in the United States Federal government was quite worried about it. Indeed, when the United States returned to Antarctica some twelve years later, it did so once again with force, this time, nuclear force, and once again, under the cover of an \"international cooperative effort,\" the Internati onal Geophysical Year of 1957- 1958. This means that if there we re indeed Germans on a secret base somewhere on that frozen continent, they had some twelve years to do whatever they were doing. In terms of the Nazi legend, supposedly they were busily perfecting their strange wartime research. In any case, as Henry Stevens points out, this period, from 1947 to 1957-58, is in fact the \"golden age\" of the flying saucer, encompassing the Kenneth Arnold sightings, the alleged Roswell UFO crash and recovery, to the famous \"buzzing\" of the Capital and White House by UFOs that supposedly made even the unflappable Harry Truman anxiou s.

The use of military force - including atomic weapons! - was \"cov ered\" by the ridiculous story that the USA an d USSR, in a rare moment of nuclear cooperation during the hei ght of the Cold War, were interested in seeing how much of the continent could be \"recovered\" for use by warming it with nuclear explosions! Accordingly, it would be necessary to explode a few small nuclear \"devices\" for above the continent to warm and melt the ice as a proof of concept! 26 A Stevens aptly qu ips, \"You already know exactly where in Antarctica they planned to explode these atomic bombs.\" 27 Three bombs were thus detonated at an altitude of approximately 300 miles above the target, one on August 27, 1958, one on August 30, 1958, and a third on September 6, 1958. 28 If these bursts were indeed intended secretly against an actual target, then why so high? Stevens hypothe sizes that they were to knock out any German equi pment in the region by the strong electromagnetic pulse that results from a nuclear detonation. While this is a plausible explanation if the intention were to occupy the alleged base via a ground assault or assaults within the time frame of the bursts, no such contingent is known to have accompanied the small armada of two destroyers, two destroyer escorts, and a small airc raft carrier. Ho wever, as we shall see in a own speculations concerning a similar scenario in connection with my examination of the Majic-12 documents and the Roswell incident in chapter 16. But supposing Stevens is correct for the sake of argument, then suffice it to say that overflights of the American capital by Nazi flying saucers so long after the war's end would certainly have shaken the national security apparatus of the United States much more than overflights by apparently benign extraterrestrial ones, and the response would have been to clamp the lid down on government research of the phenomenon, exactly as happened, since the supposedly defeated enemy was not, if this is true, really defeated after all. 26 Ibid., p. 55. 27 Ibid., p. 57. 28 Ibid. Stevens also notes that these bursts may have something to do with the \"ozone hole\" over the South Pole and the US government's reluctance to discuss the idea or the ev ents that may have caused it.

With the Geophysical Year expedition of 1958's atomic detonations, the alleged German base on the Antarctic continent fades, the Germans themselves su pposedly gradually evacuating it during the interim period from Byrd's expediti on to the final coup de grace for more favorable climes in South America. 29 There the case for Nazi survival and continued research becomes much stronger. But before we can turn to that, we must investigate the alleged German goings on at the other pole. C. Spitzbergen, Greenland, and Arctic Canada: The Other German Polar Survival Myth The Western Allies, the Russians, and the Germans all relied heavily on weather reports to plan and execute their campaigns, and for this purpose, accu rate up-to-the-minute reporting on Arctic conditions was crucial. To this end it is not surprising to find the Germans in particular outfitting special commando units - usually Waffen SS - to operate independently in Spitzbergen Island north of Norway, in Greenland, and in Ar ctic Canada. Such teams were delivered to their operational ar eas via U-boat. Spitzbergen in particular seemed to trade hands between the British and the Germans, as each side mounted commando operations to destroy the other's weather stations and listening posts. On one such occasion, the most famo us perhaps, the German battleship Tirpitz, sister ship to the Bismarck, sa iled to the island where one such British station was ope rating, leveled her 15 in ch heavy guns at it, and promptly dispatched it, no dou bt to the complete shock and surprise of the British manning it. Other allega tions have a secret German weather base and listening post operating in Franz Josef Land, the islands to the north of Finland and the Soviet Union. 30 However, with the allegations of German bases in Greenland, one again enters the realm of the surreal. These bases were allegedly comparatively large, as were the contingents of Germans 29 Ibid., p. 58. 30 Ibid, p. 5. 255"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"operating them. While they were supposedly known by the Greenlanders and occupying American forces, most efforts to find them ended in failure. 31 One postwar German source places as many as three independent SS battle groups (Kamfgruppen) operating in Greenland, under the code name of Thulekampfgruppen (Thule battle groups). The connection to the occult interests of the Third Reich are once again in evidence. Predictably, these \"Thule battle groups\" become the subject of another series of survival legends , as former SS officers supposedly reported seeing U-boats loaded with rates designated \"T hule 1 K\" and so on departing Germany in the final days of the war. 32 Sworn to secrecy by the SS, the \"clear implication is that the 'Thule 1 K' is the Thule Kampfgruppe 1\" and th at it had \"no intentions of surrender; and that there was still a mission to accomplish.\" 3 ' The Americans, so the story goes, we re unsuccessful in locating them bases for two reasons: the area was too large, and the bases were \"like the German fortifications built in Neuschwabenland...tunneled deep underneath the glaciers of ice (into presumably solid rock) and that they were bored to a length of 2000 meters.\" 34 This allegation is surely implausible, since the transport of sophisticated mining and boring equipment, let alone enough e xplosive, for such a task by U- boat would have been an enormous undertaki ng, one qu ite beyond the labor capabilities of small SS battle groups. 35 But this is not the end of the surreal aspects of the story. Should the bases have been detected, they were supposed ly defended with exotic electromagnetic weapons, one of which had a sh ort range, but that could cause the ignition of aircra ft engines to fail completely.

This ba se, he alleges, was serviced by the German military using special long-range aircraft and, of course, flying saucers! As if that were not enough, Landig maintains that these aircraft were not equipped with normal machine guns or cannon for their defensive weaponr y, but utilized a Metallstrahl, essentially an electrom agnetic \"rail gun \" used to prop el tiny pellets with extreme velocity, a kind of hy per-velocity shotgun that would more than rip apart any Allied aircraft, and do so at great di stances. 37 All of these allegations would remain merely fanciful if it were not for the discovery by Ameri can UFOlogist William Lyne - himself definitely outside th e \"mainstream\" of the UFOlogy community - of a piece of German equipment that, qu ite literally, he bought at a second-hand store in White Sands, New Mexico! 38 The unusual thing about this piece of equipment was not only its circular central swastika - a clear referenc e to the occult Thulegesellschaft since that version of the swastika appeared on its emblem - but also its designation as a Peiltochter kompass, a \"daughter compass.\" Investigating this strange piec e of equipment further, Lyne concluded that it was no ordinary co mpass, since it appeared not to operate by any magnetic means, wh ich might explai n how it ended 36 Ibid. Again, the number 150 is realistic for a battle group, but quite below the labor requirements for the construction of such large bases. 37 Ibid., pp. 11-12. 38 Lyne is the author of a rather extraordinary book of UFOlogy - a field in which the extraordinary seems to be the norm - called Space Aliens from the Pentagon, the main theme of which is his adamant insistence that UFOs are entirely terrestrial and man-made, and being used to advance a fictitious \"alien agenda\" and psychological operations campaign. Lyne, notwithstanding the more often than not unbelievable aspects of his book, was, in addition to Stevens, one of the few UFOlogists to take the Nazi origins myth of UFOs seriously prior to the publication of Nick Cook's the Hunt for Zero Point. 257"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"up in White Sands, New Mexico! L yne and his myst erious compass even became the subject of an article in a local American newspaper. Why is Lyne's find so important to the allegations of Nazi bases in the Canadian Arctic that were being supplied by long range aircraft? Very simple. If there were ever a ny truth to the allegatio ns of German bases in these heavily forested region s, then normal magnetic compasses would be of virtually no use for navigation pu rposes in the region, since standard compasses are noto riously inaccurate at the polar regions with solar energy cascading down and causing local disruptions of the magnetic fiel d. Some other method, therefore, had to be found to orient aircraft for safe navigation. Landig alleges that this was done by means of a compass that oriented itself to the sun by reading polarized light, rather than magnetic field lines. 39 Lyne therefore seems to have fou nd some version of this compass in an area of America known for its secret research laboratories some twenty years or so after La ndig's surreal allegations first appeared! But according to Landig there is even more to consider, for according to him the German base in the Canadian Arctic was actively researching and developing so-called \"free energy\" devices, devices that would tap the so-c alled \"zero point energy\" of quantum mechanics. In this connection, the research was allegedly carried out under the au spices of the SS Entw icklungstelle IV, or SS \"Developmental Installation IV,\" an entity, if it existed at all, that would have fallen under the mission brief and jurisdiction of Kammler's SS Sonderkommando, for it was responsible for \"research into making Germany independent of foreign energy sources.\" 40 39 Stevens, op. cit., p. 12. 40 Ibid., p. 19. 258"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" January 6, 1994 Albuquerque Journal North Article Featuring William Lyne and His Mysterious Nazi Compass 259"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"So with Landig's fantastic allegations, we come full circle back to the exotic energy sources, the technologies, the occult, and the SS research being conducted by Na zi Germany.

But it soon became apparent th at haphazard efforts would not ensure the survival of the Party, nor the furtherance of its ideals, nor the spread of it s power in the postwar world, nor the continuance of its research projects, which would have to be continued if it ever hoped to regain power and influence. Organization and long-r ange planning in dept h and breadth had to occur if Nazism were to survive covertly.

To a lesser extent, machine tools, steel, technicians and other personnel began to be quietly siphoned off Germany industry and smuggled out of Europe. 3 The financial treasure trove was then laundered by the SS via a variety of methods, for example, through Evita Peron's Swiss bank accounts, through dumm y corporations, through the South American drug trade, and so on. 4 During this immediate postwar period, most of this fortune was controlled by Otto Skorzeny. The German industrialists who had been set up abroad with SS money dating back to the deal at the Rotes Haus in Strassbourg in 1944 were asked by Skorzeny to pay back their loans. Both Thyssen and Krupp did so, as presumably did others. To give the reader an idea of the sums collected by Skorzeny, Eva Peron alone had an estimated $800 million dollars in bank deposits, in 1945, and 4,600 carats of diamonds and other precious stones, 90 kilograms of platinum and 2,500 kilograms of gold. 5 With these Moines, the SS purchase d huge tracts of land in South America and elsewhere, and large co rporations were established in which \"research which (sic) had begun in Germany could be carried through.\" 6 These \"secure areas\" or Sperrgebiete often saw the establishment of whol e towns, airfields, highways and all the amenities of civilized German life. 7 Local security was, of course, provided by the SS or \"contract la bor\" from the host country.

Germany could thus fulfill its postwar treaty obligations by not developing or deployin g atomic, biological, or chemical weapons on German soil, while at the same time using South Africa to construct and test a bomb of esse ntially German design.

The laborator y's assignment was to develop a mutant strain \"that would be a human killer,\" since the green monkey variety was harmless to humans. 12 But it is really the OTRAG establ ishment in Zaire that is itself of the greatest interest, for it fits the pattern of postwar SS relationships with South American governments and false from corporations. OTRAG was granted a lease by the Mobutu government to 29,000 square miles of Zaire, a lease that gave OTRAG \"complete sovereignty and control over the area.\" 13 What was the purpose of this land? Ostensibly, it was to develop and test there cheap satellite launch capabi lity for private industry, an application with obvious military overtones. 14 In other words, what one has with the OTRAG-Zaire encl ave is something like an Area 51, but owned by a private corpora tion. The enclave is nothing less than a testing facility for missiles and laboratories for biological, and presumably other types of w eapons development. According to the German Information Service of South Africa, OTRAG executives included former Nazis, some from the wartime V2 rocket project. 15 This in itself should give one pause, for it indicates that German rocket research wa s continued, not just by former Nazis working for Von Braun's NAS A in the USA, or building massive boosters for Korolev in the Soviet Union, but also for West 1 2 Horowitz, Emerging Viruses, p. 364. 1 3 Ibid., p. 365. 1 4 Ibid., pp. 365-366. 1 5 Ibid., p. 366. 268"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Germany itself! Moreover, OTRAG's shares were subsidized by the West German government, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's denials notwithstanding. 16 Finally, in wlut is a clear indication that OTRAG's purpose and goals were not simply to contrive cheap satellite launch capability, Penthouse magazine ran an expose of the German company, disclosing it s ties to the Dornier and Messerschmitt-Belkow-Blohm aer ospace and armaments firms which were quietly de veloping and testing Ge rman cruise missiles on OTRAG's Zaire range, with the aid of cruise missile technology provided to them by the Am erican Boeing Corporation. 17 Dornier and Messerschmitt were, of course, clearly tied to the Third Reich's war machine and had deep ties to its black projects. A. Bormann 's Special Evacuation Command and the Link to the Kammlerstab In part one we noted that Carter Hydrick theorized that it was none other than Martin Bormann w ho arranged the surrender of the U-234 and its precious cargo of enriched uranium, infrared proximity fuses, heavy water, an d possibly even atom bomb designs or an actual functioning atom bomb to the United States. 18 Recent research by Nick Cook would tend to corroborate Bormann's role in, and therefore probable accurate knowledge of, the full scope and extent of Kammler's secret black projects empire. Bormann's 1 6 Ibid. 1 7 Ibid, p. 367. 1 8 It should be noted that Hydrick does not maintain that the Nazis were successful in building and successfully testing an atom bomb during the war, much less of trying to transport blueprints or a functioning model to the Japanese in the U-234. I maintain this possibility on the basis of the research presented in part one, and on the corroborative evidence presented by Robert Wilcox in his Japan's Secret War, that the Japanese successfully tested a bomb shortly after the bombing of Nagasaki. An infusion of actual bomb designs to the Japanese by the Germans late in th e war might account for their relatively quick ability to develop and test a weapon under such difficult circumstances as the Japanese economy and milit ary were in at the end of the war. However, it should also be noted that the Japanese had independently designed their own workable bomb along similar lines as existing German designs, as well as along the lines employed in the Little Boy Hiroshima bomb. 269"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"position as controller of Nazi Party finances as well as of H i t l e r ' s estate would have given him cont rol over yet another source of funding for these projects, a source completely independent of the state. It is in this total context both of Carter Hydride's meticulous research, as well as of Bormann' s own Rotes Haus plan for Nazi survival, that we may place Bo rmann's 1945 establishment of a special SS evacuation Kommando, an act that placed jurisdiction over the Ju 290 four engine and Ju 390 six engine heavy-lift ultra long range air transport of Luftwaffe Kampfgeschwader 200 under the direct control of none other than SS General Hans Kammler. The intention is clear: as much of the actual research files and equipment of the Kammlerstab as could be evacuated from Germany for destinations unknown was to be handled by Kammler personally. This special evacuation command held these aircraft in readiness near Lower Silesia in late 1945. By this point, Kammler's power, backed by the Re ichsleiter himself, wa s so great that he could refuse a request by Reichsf uhrer SS Himmler for the use of one of these aircraft. 19 Kammler, \"with such aircraft at his disposal\" would have been able to fly a large cargo of \"documents, personnel and technology pretty much anywhe re\" that he wanted to. \"Spain, South America - Argentina even - would have represented no problem to such a long-range platform.\" 20 Cook himself quips, \"What was the point of chasing Ka mmler, if he'd already shipped everything out?\" 21 This revelation, coming late in the story of research into Nazi secret wea pons and the Nazi UFO legend, gives a clear indication that more than just money, bullion, gems, art treasures or personnel were involv ed in Bormann's survival plan. Clearly, Bormann meant to preser ve and continue the research already under way in the Reich by transplanting the technology and continuing its development elsewhere, either under independent Nazi control - as the various \"sur vival\" myths maintain - or under 1 9 Nick Cook, the Hunt for Zero Point, pp. 186-187, 199. 20 Ibid., p. 199. 21 Ibid. 270"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"the nominal control of a host fove rnment, or via some combination of both modalities. If Carter Hydrick is correct that it was Bormann's intention to surrender the bulk of this techno logy to the United States - and I believe he is - then this puts Himmler's last ditch and clumsy efforts to negotiate a separate peace with the Western Allies via Sweden into a new light. As has already been suggested in this work, Himmler was perhaps offering them the vast cache of secrets he thought he controlled through Kammler's \"thi nk tank.\" And, as has been seen, it is very possible that the American intelligence community already knew of this treasure trove via their SS contacts through Allen Dulles and SS Genera l Wolff, and had made \"other arrangements\" that included neither Himmler nor the British. Thus, by the time of Kammler's refusal to his SS bo ss to allow him the use of a Ju 290 or Ju 390, effect ive control and di sposition of the SS black projects had slipped fr om Himmler's hands and into Bormann's. Himmler could neither surrender nor even barter for his life, because he had nothing left with which to bargain. Kammler, and Bormann, however, had a great deal to offer the Americans in exchange for their lives. B. Paperclip, Compartmenta lization, and Ca pitalization According to Nick Cook, Oper ation Paperclip, the covert project to bring former Nazi scient ists and engineer s to the United States to work on America's ow n aerospace and military black projects after the war, was th e primary beneficiary of the Kammlerstab's think tank secrets, blueprints, and patents. \"The state within a state had been trans ported four thousand miles to the west and somehow, I just knew, Kammler had come with it. The intuitive feeling I'd experienced in all these years in obscure corners of the US aerospace and defence industry had sudde nly acquired a face.\" 22 But an important question re mains to be answered here. Could these Nazis have continued their lines of research quasi- independently, even while ostensibly working for the US military? Could they have again reconstituted themselves as a similar \"state 22 Nick Cook, The Hunt for Zero Point, p. 252. 271"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"within a state,\" a black projects coordination o ffice within the structures otherwise nominally under the control, of the American government and military? Clearly, it would be difficult, especially if there were no means of independent financing of these projects, altogether apart from t h e US government's own \"black budge t.\" But we have already seen that a crucial component of Bormann's postwar survival and resuscitation plan was capitalizati on. Three conduits in particular were often utilized by O.D.E.S.S. A and other postwar Nazi secret organizations: (1) drugs and thereby organized crime, (2) t h e Church, i.e., various \"ministries\" within Protestan tism and diverse religious orders and congregati ons within the Roman Catholic Church, and (3) false corporate fronts and dummy corporations, holding companies, and banking institutions. The United State, particularly in the last few decades, seems to have been a fertile ground for all three types of activ ity, at least in general terms. As for maintaining the secrecy of such an in dependent and \"occulted\" entity, this is a solv ed problem, for the Manhattan Project was just such an entity, w ith only a very few at the highest echelons of its myriad compartm entalized \"need-to-know\" departments possessing the whol e picture. In the postwar atmosphere, particularly with the Cold War ensuing, it may actually have been quite easy to accompli sh. With US government defense contracts and black projects run increasingly on a cost-plus basis, all expenses for such research wa s funded, with an addition margin tacked on for corporat e profit. This, added to the other genuinely off-the-books funding that Borma nn and the SS envisioned, would have supplied twin sources of fu nding of almost limitless wealth. But the most important consideration with respect to this question is the fact that the very classification and compartmentalization of black pr ojects would itself operate as a favorable environment to run an \" unofficial\" black project within an \"official\" one. With projects split over several locations, its needed technologies farmed out to various companies, various departments of government, and coordinated from some secret center, it would seem a relatively easy, rather than difficult, thing to do. 272"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"The Nazi Party had been constituted, from its early secret s o c i e t y beginnings, and up until the very day of the German capitulation, as a stat e within a state. Within that structure, Himmler had constituted the SS as a state within the state within the state. And within that Kammler had assembled and coordinated a vast machinery of horror and weapons research that lived, parasitically, on the body of its host, the SS and the Party, themselves murderous parasites living off the misery of Germany and Europe. Kammler had done it once, and may very well have done it again, \"with a little help from his friends.\" As was mentioned previously, perhaps President Dwight Eisenhower, when he warned of the morally and spir itually corrupting dangers of the military-industrial complex, had in mind a phenomenon that was not so much home-grown, as much as one that had been transplanted. 273"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"16.

Introductory Remarks In these final chapters I propose to offer a different interpretation of two famous UFO \"crash and recovery\" cases than is the standard in the UFOlog y community, as a speculative corroboration of the thesis that somewhere, someone was continuing the line of very secret black projects the Nazis had initiated. The two famous cases are the 1947 Roswell crash, and the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania crash. These speculative reinterpretations of these two events are impelled, in part, by the momentum of the evidence thus fa r presented, and in part by the two remarkable statements made by Colonel Philip J. Corso in his well-known book, The Day After Roswell. Indeed, these statements 1 Col. Philip J. Corso, (Ret.) with William J. Birnes, The Day After Roswell (New York: Pocket Books, 1997), pp. 4, 73. 274"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"of Corso, coming as they do in a book whose main thesis is the seeding of recovered \"alie n\" (i.e., extrater restrial, and not \"foreign\") technology into American industry, are for that very reason all the more remarkable, a nd they seem to invite such a reinterpretation. But what exactly is the ET myth of the UFO? To examine it, one must place it within the multitude of hypotheses that attempt to explain the genuine UFO phenomenon: (1) The phenomenon represents a spiritual deception by demons of the human race; (2) The phenomenon represents a life form from higher dimensions, or perhaps a life form composed directly of electromagnetic energy or even plasmas; 2 (3) The phenomenon represents intelligently controlled real physical spacecraft from other pl anets, usually with the tacit understanding that these are the craft form planets of other solar systems, and that the craft have thus traveled a minimum of four light years to visit earth, since the closest neighboring star is four light years away; (4) The phenomenon is terrestrial a nd human in origin (usually with the added condition that they are government black projects back-engineered fr om captured or crashed extraterrestrial craft, and some times in conjunction with the hypothesis that the \"visitor s\" are humans from our own future). It is a generally established fact that the bulk of UFO sightings that are considered genuine are usually interpreted in UFOlogy by the fourth hypothesis, with numbers two and three following not far behind. This is par ticularly the case wi th the Roswell and Kecksburg crashes. 2 The well-known quantum and plasma physicist David Bohm, for example, came to the conclusion that some of the plasmas with which he experimented in his early career exhibitte d the sort of self-organizing properties that one normally ascribes to life. Bohm ended his plasma experiments at that point. 275"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"It is consequently fair to sa y that an \"ET My th\" or perhaps better, an \"ET paradigm\" has grown around the phenomenon to such an extent that any seriou s study or contemplation of the possibility of a terrestrial human origin and explanation for these events is seldom considered seri ously. And the US Air Force's own ridiculous explanations of Roswe ll - from weather balloons, crashed Japanese bamboo ballon-bombs, and Project Mogul balloons designed to monitor Soviet nuclear tests (which in any case were not to begin until two years later) - have onl y added fuel to the ET Myth as the regnant paradigm by which to interpret these two signal events. By designating this interpreta ive framework by the term \" E T Myth\" I do not, however, wish to imply that there is no basis in solid research or rational conjecture for it. I use the term \"myth\" here not in the contemporary sens e of implying something \"unreal\" but in its classic sense as an all-encompassing paradigm by which an unusual phenomenon, in this case flying saucers, tends to be interpreted even by the best, mo st objective, and scrupulous researchers. 3 Yet there is another \"myth\" of the flying saucer phenomenon, the one that we have been examining in the past few chapters of this book. And once one admits into the di scussion a possible terrestrial origin and explanation for the phe nomenon, one will inevitably have to deal with this other myth and its historical origins in World War Two. B. The Smilarity of Evidence fo r Roswell and the \"Nazi Legend\" As noted at various po ints throughout this book, the \"Legend\" of a Nazi origin of many wa rtime and postwar UFO reports received a big \"credibility boost\" wh en a researcher and reporter for the prestigious jane's Defence Weekly, British reporter Nick Cook, wrote a book on anti-gravity and quantum zero point energy research called The Hunt for Zero Point. The \"credibility boost\" that Cook's book gave to this Nazi Legend might even be seen as 3 I would certainly include UFOlogists such as Don Berliner, Stanton Friedman, Timothy Good, and Nick Pope in this category. 276"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"analogous to the \"credibility boost\" that Colonel Corso's book gave to the Roswell crash and th e ET interpretation of it. Cook's book, like Co rso's in some respects, is a personal chronicle, summarizing in anec dotal fashion hi s own personal research into American anti-gravity projects - a \"hunt\" as he calls it- that quickly led him to a very unsuspected source: Nazi Germany. Recounting how many of the best repor ts of \"foo fighters\" or UFOs during the war were submitted by the 415th Night Fighter Squadron, and occurred in a triang le over southern Germany from Frankfurt-am-Main, Metz, and Stra sbourg in the year 1944, Cook then recounts his discovery of the book that gave birth to the Legend, German Major Rudolf Lusar' s German Secret Weapons of World War Two: Seeking clues to the foo-fighter mystery, I discovered a copy in the reading room of the Imperial War Museum. In it, Lusar described in meticulous detail, in language that often made the depths of his bitterness clear, the technical acheivements of 'a small, industrious and honest nation which lost the war.' Secret Weapons made somber reading. Although German technical achievements were visible in developments such as the V-l flying bomb, a direct forerunner of the modern-day cruise missile, and the V-2 ballistic missile, it was the vast extent of Germany's underpinning technology base, as revealed by Lusar, which showed just how far ahead of the Allies the Nazis had been in certain key areas. Jet engines, rocket engines, infrared and thermal-imaging systems, proximity fuses, missiles gu idance seekers....technologies that are integral to most modern aircraft and airborne weapon systems were all listed and described. In the late 1950s, when Lusar's book first appeared, these technologies were still in their infancy in Britain and America. Yet the Germans had been working on them a decade and a half earlier. But there was another side to the book, one which was so sensational that immediately on its appearance it had set alarm bells ringing in Washington. This side of the book related to so-called German 'wonder- weapons' beyond the V-l and V-2.... Other esoteric developments detailed by Lusar showed that the Germans had been working on bringing down Allied aircraft with 277"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"sound waves, air vortices, intensely focused beams of light and jets of compressed air. In 1958, the US Air Force commissioned a 'special studies group' within Air Force Intelligence headed by an Austrian-born technical consultant called Dr Stefan Possony to carry out a detailed appraisal of Lusar's book. The research effort was branded 'secret' and has only recently come to light.... A section in Lusar's book was devoted to 'flying sacuers' which he asserted, in no uncertain terms, were the product of German wartime inventors. 'Experts and collaborators in this work confirm that the first projects, called \"flying disks\", were undertaken in 1941,' Lusar wrote. He even went on to name the key individuals involved. These were 'the German experts Schriever, Habermohl, and Miethe, and the Italian Bellonzo.' 4 Cook's thesis is one that will guide our examination of some of the Majic-12 or Majestic-12 documents in this chapter, with a view to explicating a possible underlyi ng \"German\" connection to the Roswell crash and cover-up: Make the link between Germany and the flying sacuer and here was an opportunity to solve not only the anti-gravity propulsion riddle, but, in the process, perhaps, one of the most baffling mysteries of the 20th century: the origins of the UFO.... The flying disc must have exhibited performance so in advance of its time that it had been super- classified, then hidden in plain sight - behind the UFO myth - for the best part of 60 years. 5 However, as Cook quickly di scovered, the Nazi Legend has a significant problem: Lusar mentione d four names, but other than these four names, the testimony for the Legend, until very recently, was based almost completely on hearsay. 6 There were no declassified documents in the 1 950s and 1960s to back up Lusar's incredible story. Indeed, it was on ly with German reunification and the subsequent \"declassification spree\" that it prompted that corroborating documentation finall y became available, and in sufficient quantity and quality to constitute a solid prima facie case. 4 Nick cook, op. cit., p. 5 Ibid., pp. 46-47, emphasis added. 6 Ibid., p. 47. 278"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"It is this fact, that the trail into the Legend seems to lead nowhere and yet everywhere at one and the same time, that is the main reason it is so seldom pe rsued by serious UFO researchers, most of whom simply laugh it off when confronted with it, especially in the North Am erican UFOlogy community. But the problem with th e Nazi Legend is really not with its early uncorroborated hearsay testimony, nor even with its then quite unsubstantiated claims in the postwar West German media. 7 The problem was not really with the second-hand or hearsay testimony of a few dead men and a few odd documents claiming a secret provenance deep within the blac k projects of the Waffen SS. The problem is that the same basi c type of evidence exists for the Roswell incident of the allege d crash of a flying saucer. Beyond the fact that there were a few pr imary source witnesses - Mac Brazzel, Jesse Marcel, Walter Haut and so on - that researchers such as William Moore, Charles Berlitz and Stanton Friedman were able to interview personally, ther e are a whole host of secondary testimonies to the event that have surfaced since then. In this very general respect, the dynamics of the Roswell ET Myth and the Nazi UFO Legend are remarkably similar. And like the Nazi Legend, classified documents showed up to corroborate the story, only this time, the documents were not decl assified, but rather, apparently leaked to the UFOlogy community. These are, of course, the now famous (or depending on one's lights, infamous) MJ-12, or Majestic-12, or Majic-12 docume nts, the primary focus of this chapter. In the pro-UFO community, much fanfare has been made over the years about the \"dozens\" or even \"hundreds\" of eyewitnesses to the allged UFO crash near Roswell....

The relevant issue is not how many witnesses were interviwed, but rather what type of wtinesses (i.e., firsthand, secondha nd, etc.) these people are and how truthful and accurate their statements are. Unfortunately, a careful reading of Moore and Berlitz's Roswell Incident reveals that despite the impressive claim of having \"interviewed more than seventy witnesses,\" the testimonies of just twenty-five people are presented. Out of these twenty-five, only seven of them are firsthand sources who claim to have seen the alleged saucer debris, and one of these accounts is suspect. Of these seven people, however, only five of them claim to have actually handled the material personally, and one of them is adamant that it was not from an extraterrestrial spacecraft. 9 Researcher interviews of a few pr imary source \"eyewitnesses\": t h i s much the Roswell ET Myth and the Nazi UFO Legend have in common. The problem thus posed by th e mere existence of the Nazi Legend in this context is theref ore very significant: Why does one event form such a stable and consistent foundation in t h r e historiography of the ET-UFO My thos, and why is the other hypothesis so consistently avoided by the same community, when in general, both the ET explanation of the Roswell incident, and the Nazi UFO Legend are based upon not only the same types of evidence, but initially, the same a pproximate quantity of evidence? Put differently, why is the ET Myth so predominant in all \"unofficial\" explanations of th e Roswell crash, and the hypothesis of a terrestrially-originated though exotic technology as an explanation consistently avoided? The answer I believe, lies in some peculiarities of the Majic-12 documents themselves. 9 Kal K. Korff, The Roswell UFO Crash, pp. 28-29. 280"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"C. The Majic-12 Documents: The ET Myth vs the Nazi Legend The Majic-12 documents are well-known in UFOlogy circles, and a controversy has ensued over their genuineness and authenticy, or lack thereof. The documents themselves purport to be highly classified top secret memoranda, studies, and so on, concerning the Roswell crash and its aftermath: the establishment of a deep cover, highly classified UF O retrieval, back-engineering, and study group composed of top civili an and military leaders with a large black projects budget. Th e documents, complete with many blacked out areas - represente d by strings of question marks \"?????\" in the quotations which follow - were l eaked to the public in two different sets. As well known and respected UF Ologist Stanton Friedman put it, the first set of documents arrived in December of 1984, quite literally \"on Jaimie Shandera's doorstep.\" 10 Shandera, a film director, had contacted Friedman about the possibil ity of doing a fictional movie concerning UFOs, wanting Friedman to be a consultant for the movie. Then, in December 1984, the Majestic-12 documents showed up on Jaimie Shandera'a doorstep. To be more exact, a roll of undeveloped black-and-white 35mm film came in the mail to Shandera's home in Burbank in a double- wrapped plain brown envelope with no return address and an Albuquerque, New Mexico postmark. Why was it sent to Jaimie? One possibility is that it was well-known that Shandera had been working closely with Bill Moore and myself on the Roswell crash story, and that together with Bill, had had many contacts with insiders, some of whom were connected with OSI in Albuquerque. Bill and Jaime's meetings with Agent Doty and others had left them with the impression that these insiders were interested in having the facts about flying saucers released to the public, in a manner that would protect their identity and their status. But we may never know. After Bill and Jaime developed the film, they called me. What they found on the film were duplicate sets of eight pages of documents that were classified TOP SECRET/MAJ1C, with a title page declaring 10 Stanton Friedman, Top Secret/Majic (New York: Marlowe and Company, 1996), p. 20. 281"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"\"Briefing Document: Operation Ma j e s ti c 1 2 prepared for President Elect Dwight D. Eisenhower: (Eyes Only) 18 November, 1952.\" The second page listed the members of the Majestic-12 group, all of whom were dead.... Incredible as it sounded, the docum ents on this film dealt with the New Mexico crashes as well as with the government's efforts to keep them secret. According to the br iefing, the wreckage of a crashed saucer was recovered by the U.S. government 75 miles northwest of Roswell in early July 1947. Four sm all alien bodies, apparently ejected from the vehicle, were found two miles east of the main wreckage site. The government took into its possession the wreckage and the bodies for careful study and evaluation, a nd in September 1947, officially established Operation Majestic-12 as a \"top secret Ressearch and Development/Intelligence operation responsible directly and only to the President of the United States.\" 11 Friedman, as any seri ous investigator woul d, approached the question of the authenticity of the document cautiously. There were, as he saw it, thre e possible explanations of the document, if indeed it was legitima te, and if indeed it was genuinely leaked. The documents could be: (1) legitimate in the sense of genuinely originating from the military-intelligence community, but they could have been composed or intended to be disinformation or a hoax in some elaborate psychological warfare operation; 12 (2) legitimate in the se nse that they might \"contain some truth mixed with some phony material;\" 13 (3) could be \"Plain straight legitimate.\" 14 Most of the controversy within the UFOlogical community has centered on options (1) and (3), between thos e who maintain that they are a simple hoax or part of some disinformation operaton, and 1 1 Friedman, op. cit., pp. 20-21. 1 2 Ibid., p. 22.

Then, as Friedman, Moore, and Shandera were investigating the Eisenhower Briefing Document, a second set of purported Majic-12 top secret documents were leak ed, this time to UFOlogist Don Berliner, and a mystified man in California named Timothy Cooper. In March of 1994, D on Berliner, like Jaim e Shandera ten years earlier, received a roll of undeve loped Tri-X film in his mail box. The film contained what was allege dly the actual operations manual for UFO recovery teams called th e \"Special Operations Manual.\" But the most sensational Majic -12 documents are doubtless those leaked to Timothy Cooper, the so-called \"Cooper-Cantwheel Majic-12\" documents. Cooper, who had grown up near the White Sands Missile range, had become in terested in the subject of UFOs and secret missile research as a youth when someone shared information about UFOs with him. His curiosity piqued, he began research on the top secret facility by filing FOIA requests, assembling a large and thor ough collection of government documents. Then in 1992, Cooper began receiving photocopied Majic-12 documents in his mail box from a man calling himself \"Thomas Cantwheel.\" 16 1 5 Friedman falls into the group arguing for option three: \"Based on my detailed study and investigation of the overall UFO phenomenon beginning in 1958, I am equally certain that (1) so me UFOs are intelligently controlled extraterrestrial spacecraft; (2) the subject of flying saucers represents a kind of cosmic Watergate, wherein a relatively small group of people in government have known about the visitors for many years; (3) none of the anti-UFO arguments made by a small but vocal group of debunkers stand up under scrutiny; and (4) visits by extraterrestrial space vehicles and the successful 50- year coverup of the best evidence (alie n bodies and wreckage) is the biggest story of the millenium.\" 1 6 Dr. Robert M. and Ryan S.

Again Wood and Wood argued quite persua sively for the authenticity of the documents, but again, following option (3), they argued that the documents are \"plain straight legitimate.\" Two of the Cantwheel Majic-12 documents have become focal points of UFOlogy interest, and for good reason: The \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate\" of Air Force General Nathan Twining, and the \"Majestic Twelve Project First Annual Report.\" These are the documents that contain actual techni cal descriptions of the alleged crashed alien craft recovere d at Roswell, along with recommendations on what to do about it. Accordingly, we shall accept the ar guments of Robe rt and Ryan Wood and their exhaustive proces s of document authentication, and assume that the documents are legitimate, and using internal indications and inconsistencies, we shall argue that these two documents are best interpreted as containing part truth, and part deliberate deception, and that both of these elements point possibly, though nowhere near co nclusively, to a terr estrial, and German, origin for the exotic craft that crashed in New Mexico in 1947, and that this is the element that is the ultimate ob ejctive of the cover-up, as alluded to by Colonel Corso's statements that form the epigrams to this chapter. The methodology will be that already hinted at by Corso's statements, and more completely outlined by Nick Cook: Make the link between Germany and the flying saucer and here was an opportunity to solve not only the anti-gravity propulsion riddle, but, in the process, perhaps, one of the most baffling mysteries of the 20th century: the origins of the UFO.... The flying disc must have exhibited performance so in advance of its time that it had been super- classified, then hidden in plain sight - behind the UFO myth -for the best part of 60 years. 17 17 Cook, op. cit., pp. 46-47. 284"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"In brief, I shall argue that there are two levels at work in the Majic- 12, \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate\" and the \"First Annual Report\" documents: (1) A genuine level, in which the technical aspects of the recovered technology are summar ized.

Conversely, as wi ll be shown, there are detailed parallel s between the de scriptions of the recovered technology of the Roswell cras h, and the already examined secret weapons black projects of Nazi Germany covered in the previous part of this book; (2) A level of disinformation, where the emerging \"ET explanation\" forms a final deep cover layer of disinformation behind the public explanations of crashed weather or Project Mogul balloons. The resulting clash of these two emphases constitutes one basis for those who would wish to challenge the authenticity of the documents, which they most certainly are. 1. The \"White Hot In telligence Estimate \" of General Nathan Twining The \"White Hot Intelligence Estimat e\" is actually the first part of a Majic-12 document called \"Mission Assessment of Recovered Lenticular Aerodyne Objects and Implications in ??????AR??\". 18 This document is the second examin ation of the crashed vehicles - note the plural - describing so me aspects of the technology retrieved and analyzed by the military after the Roswell incident. Besides the standard authenticating features thoroughly investigated by Wood and Wood - typeface comparisons, document style manual and orthography and so on - all of which is srongly in favor of authenticity, there are a number of internal descriptions 18 Wood and Wood, The Majestic Documents, p. 63. The strings of question marks correspond to the blacked-out areas of the original photocopies. 285"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"that do not make sense if the recovered object were of extraterrestrial origin and interpla netary travel capa bility. That is, the best explanation of this part icular document seems to lie not with Friedman's options (1) or (3), but with option (2), that they contain some truth mixed with phony or deliberately distorted material. As will be seen as we proceed, a disturbing hypothetical scenario begins to emerge if one examines this document not from the interpretive paradigm of the ET Myth (option (3)), but from the perspective of the Nazi Legend (and option (2)). In arguing for this latter interpretation of the document, we shall focus on three key areas: (a) Odd language of a genera l nature describing the UFO phenomenon and areas and type s of activity as they were then known; (b) incongrous technical language that describes something simultaneously both very ad vanced, and yet very commonplace; (c) ambiguous language reflectin g perhaps an amount of indecision or hesitation conc erning the nature of what was recovered, and what to do about it. With these thoughts in mind, we begin by noting the first and most obvious point: both the Roswell crash and Admiral Byrd's Operation Highjump, with the admi ral's astounding statement in the South American Chilean El Mercurio, occur in the same year, within a few months of each other. (a) Odd Language of a General Nature Describing the UFO Phenomenon and Its Area and Types of Activity After a brief history of the postwar UFO phenomenon, beginning with Kenneth Arnold's June 1947 sighting, the document then points out the apparent interst of \"ET\" in our military installations: \"Numerous sightings over military installations in the state of New Mexico were investigated by Army and Navy 286"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"intelligence officers.\" 19 The report also mentions sightings in \"Sweden and Germany, Holland, Paraguay, Scandinavia, Greece, by ships at sea.\" 20 A typical explanation from the ET paradigm is that UFOs began to exhibit an interest in our milita ry installations and increased their monitoring activities of the human r ace afer it had mastered nuclear energy and weaponized it in the atom bomb, po ssibly fearing that we might venture into outer spac e and bringing our warlike habits and weapons of mass destrcution with us. As an explanation of \"their\" then evident \"obsrve but do not contact\" beha vior, this is plausible. We were being surve illed, if not reconnoitered. But such behavior in itself m eans nothing, for such patterns coul d equally describe monitoring and surveilling operations of who lly terrestrial but unknown origins. Note also the curious wording of paragraph 6: \"Sweden and Germany....Scandinavia.\" Wh y the redundancy? A possible explanation, though one not indicated by the document itself, is that two different types of phenomena might be being referred to. However, \"Sweden and Germany, Holland, Paraguay, Scandinavia, Greece\" and \"ships at sea\" would not seem to be of the same interst to \"ET' if the purpose of the moni toring activity was, as some like Friedman have suggested, to m easure human progress in atomic energy applications and weapons. This vague inconsistency then becomes more acute once attenti on is focused on the technical descriptions of the document. (b) Technical Language that Describes Something Simultaneously both Very Advanced, yet Very Commonplace Perhaps the best evidence that the document should be interpreted as being both genu ine and yet containing \"phony\" or \"faked\" elements concerns the technical descriptions and references. For example, immediately after the odd refernce to sightings in Sw eden and Germany and th en \"Scandinavia\", the 1 9 Ibid., p. 65, par. 5. 20 Ibid.,, p. 65, par. 6. 287"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"document then goes on to record t h e \"extraordinary capabiltities\" of the recovered craft: Of the 1,200 sighting reports collect (sic) since 1942 approximately 200 incidents have proven to be unknown craft operation (sic) at speeds in excess of 1200 MPH and at times attaining altitudes up to ?? miles or more above the ear th.

To put it succinctly, the performa nce characteristics described are not advanced enough to be extraterrestrial in origin. Note that if the craft's speed were in the area of a mere 1,200 MPH, as this portion of the document states, then the use of such a craft for interplanetary exploration would seem to be absurb in the extreme, particularly if it is main tained that these craft originated from outside our solar system, wh ich is the presumption implicit with every \"ET\" interpretation of the Roswell event. If one conceded top speeds of even te n thousand miles per hour for the craft, then a trip to Mars, our closest planetary neignbor at approximately 36,000,000 miles fr om the earth, would take 150 days. At a mere 1,200 miles per hour, however, a journey to Mars would take about 1250 days, or almo st three and a half years, and 21 Ibid., pp. 65-66, par. 7, emphasis added. 288"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"neither of these figures is even factoring in the positions of the planets at any given moment of th eir orbital periods around the sun nor the cirved trajectory sueh cr aft would have to follow between the two planets!

The first part of this detailed technical assessment is called \"P roject White Hot Intelligence Estimate (Preliminary).\" Here it is necessary to cite the document at length: LANDING ZONE NO. 1 Socorro, New Mexico - The unidentified lenticular-shaped aerodyne which has been designated ULAT-1, has been evaluated as a non-air breathing aircraft of unknown origin. Totally lacking conventional wing, fuselage, nacelle, control, and fuel systems strongly indicates it is not Russian. Consultation with Paperclip specialists concur. Aerodynamic features exhibited in ULAT-1 represent a very high degree of engineering and sophistication not seen in this country. Dimensional homogeneity study cannot explain how this craft sustains load and lift factors necessary for flight. The power plant does not resemble any conventional type now in use. Lacking any discernible intake or exhaust features, it is the opinion of AMC and ONR that this craft was designed to operate ouside of the earth's atmosphere. The unconventional conclusions reached by members of this fact-finding mission remain tentative at this time. Some members expressed the view that ULAT-1 may be the product of an advanced culture from another planet that is much older than ours and has utilized the science and intellect for inerplanetary psace travel. It is not precisely known if the occupants purposely had the objective of exploration out of curiosity or with the intent of surveying for other reasons. So far, no hostile intent has been observed since they made their presence known. Given the fact that our atomic bomb tests, atmospheric exploration with rockets, and ???????????????????????????????ed in New Mexico, could have precipitated the events that led to the incident and subsequent actions taken by the military.

Concerns over possible exposure to civilians of known biological and chemical agents dictated the quara ntine measures taken.

Several bodies were dicovered. Because on-site medical personnel were unsure of the physiological and biological make-up of the occupants, special preparations and preservation methods were employed Autopsy information obtained so far suggests that the occupants mimic the features associated with Orientals .

It is their occurrence in the same context, wit hout apparent analysis or attempt to resolve the ambiguity, that requires interpretation and explanation. Note first of all that, at this stage of the \"preliminary investigation\" the origins of th e craft remain, in its own word, \"unknown.\" But a little later on the document indicates that there was apparently some internal dissention in the preliminary study group: \"Some members expressed th e view that ULAT-1 may be the product of an adva nced culture from another planet...\" In other words, there appears to have been genuine indecision and hesitancy on where to attribute the origin of the craft. This tends to be an internal corroboration and consiste ncy with what we have already observed above regarding the recovered technology and the craft's performance characteristics, for apparently the recovered 22 Ibid., pp. 67-68, emphasis added. 290"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"technology, considered as a factor in and of itself, is not sufficiently advanced enough to argue on its own basis lor an extraterrestrial origin. What does argue for the extr aterrestrial nature is not the recovered technology, but the recove red biology. It is the clash of these two sets of facts, then, that appears to be behind the hinted-at internal dissention in the study group when it came to the question of origins of the recovered vehicle. There is another technological bombshell that deserves to be weighed carefully in the light of what has alread y been stated regarding the Nazi UFO Lege nd and Kammler' s think tank: \"Totally lacking conventional wing, fuselage , nacelle, control and fuel systems strongly indicates it is not Russian. Consultation with Paperclip specialists concur.\" The question that now inevitably arises is this: Would the US military have been likely to consult the nearby former Nazi rocket scientis ts in its employment if it even remotely suspected that what had fallen into its hands was something extraterrestrial, and thereby, technologi cally extremely advanced and sophisticated? I think it is possible, but very unlikely. The more likely explanation was hi nted at by Colonel Corso himself in the epigrams that began this chapter: the Ge rman Paperclip scientists were shown the recove red vehicle, which on Corso's own admission looked like one of the Horten br others' flying wings, because the craft itself and its perfromance charac teristics were highly suggestive of similar high performance and unconventional aerodynes under development by Nazi Germany. In this context, the very next statement is perhaps very telling and suggestive, for the language is very careful and deliberate: \"Aerodynamic features exhibited in ULAT-1 represent a very high degree of engineering and sophistication not seen in this country.\" 23 If an \"ET\" origin were suspect ed, and that explanation already agreed upon, then the sentence would have read \"Aerodynamic features exhibited in ULAT-1 re present a very high degree of engineering and sophistication not seen on this planet.\" So what country is meant here, and in this context? Only three countries are immediately represented in the pr evious discussion. Was it Russia? Germany? or the United States? Once again, the language retreats 23 Ibid., p. 67, emphasis added. 291"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"into ambiguity, though the clearest explanation is that the country referred to is the United States, otherwise, why bring in the German Paperclip scientists to render their opinion? At this juncture an odd transition occurs, for in the segue to the discussion of the recovered bodies, the \"ET\" myth begins to surface in this context as a plausible explanation for explaining the UFOs' military-style surveilling activities, activities begun, so the document surmises, in response to humanity's detonation of atom bombs during the war and after. This explanation, in feet, was arrived at years later, and quite independently, by astute UFOlogists such as Friedman. With the mention of recovered bodies the segue is complete, and one is now confronted by a set of data and descriptions totally at variance with the technical data and the data-set favoring terrestrial origins hypothesi s: \"Several bodies were discovered....Outwardly, tehy app ear human-like with but one exceptions....a rarely observed...,\" and then follws a blacked out area. A rarely observed what? Presumably a rarely observed phsyiological feature in humans, but evidently recurring in all of the recovered bodies. Was it a rare blood type or blood disease? Webbed toes and digits? Extra or missing fingers? We do not know. But having blacked out this all-important and conclusive feature, the document then concludes that this \"rarely observed something\" supports \"the premise th at these beings originate from another planet.\" Note then that, as far as the document itself is concerned, it is not the recovered technology but the recovered biology that argues the most persua sively for the ET origins of the craft. But this conclusion, as it sta nds, is for us, if not for the writer and compiler of the report itself, an argument from silence. The ET explanation is therefore the w eaker of the two explanations internal to the document as they have been publicly redacted and received. The second part of the document is entitled \"Technical Evaluation (Preliminary).\" Here it will be necessary to cite this part of the document in fall, including once again the blacked out portions, in order to exhibit the fall extent of the contradictory nature of these two very different data-sets. 292"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"PART II TECHNICAL EVALUATION (PRELIMINARY) ULAT-1 1. Upon close examination of the ex terior surfaces of the craft's fuselage, metallurgists found the skin to be of a ferrous metal white in color.

Based on all vailable evidence collected from recovered exhibits currently under study by AMC, AFSWP, NEPA, AEC, ONR, NACA, JRDB, RAND, USAAF, SAG, and MIT, are deemed extraterrestrial in nature. This conclusion was reached as a result of comparisons of artifacts from th e Missouri discovery in 1941. The technology is outside the scope of US science, even that of German rocket and aircraft development. 2. Interplanetary space travel is possible provided adequate funding, necessary resources are made available, and national interest is piqued. 5. Human origins may not be constrained to one planet. Our genus may be found among solar systems similar to our own. 6. The laws of physics and geneti cs may have a genesis in a higher, structured order that once (sic) previously thought. 26 24 Note that the ordering here is that of the orginal document. As the Drs. Wood suggest, this flaw argues strongly for the document's authenticity. I concur. 25 The lens detonator refers to the implosion device used in plutonium based atom bombs to compress the critical mass. The device was described in part one. The shotgun detonator refers to the critical mass assembly mechanism in uranium-235 based atom bombs. 26 Wood and Wood, op. cit., pp. 69-75, emphasis added.

We begin with the conclusion the document reaches after the lengthy summary of the technical data: \"Based on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currently under study by AMC (etc.)...are deemed ex traterrestrial in nature.\" 27 Note then what has happened within the same document. What began as an open-ended discussion, with either th e terrestrial or extraterrestrial explanations being left more or le ss an open question in Part I of the document, quickly becomes a definitive conclusion in favor of the ET hypothesis by Part III, after Part II mentioned that \"rarely observed something\" as being ev idence for an ET origin of the recovered bodies. Thus, what is otherwise an extraordinary but nevertheless terrestrially explainable list of technical components in Part III becomes deftly reinterpreted within the ET paradigm that formed the transition from Part I to Part III. It is to be admitted that some of the technical descriptions found in Part III would baffle most engineers of 2004, not to mention those of 1947: \"there were no visible signs of plate- stiffeners. There were no fastners, weld(sic), rivets, or fittings holding the fuselage together.\" 28 Another unusual technological feature that, in 1947 at least, woul d have argued strongly for an ET origin of the craft was the a pparent biological-mechanical \"interface\" between pilot/crew and the craft that allowed immediate brain-craft control interaction, an d which would have accounted for the apparent lack of normal contro l surfaces that was noted in he report: \"symbolic notation appears to be the form for flight and control indicators. Flat panels of unknown metal has (sic) been suggested,\" and so on. 29 While this type of biometri c technology is now known - and employed - by today's western military forces, it was only a science fiction dream in 1947.

Finally, the most exact description of an ad vanced technology in apparent advance of 1947 Am erican capabilities is foun d at the very end of Part II, with its description of thin plastic sheets coating by a film of silver on which was inscribed a fine grid like pattern of lines, circles and intersecting patterns. What is described here sounds very much like a 1947 description of an integrated circuit. But what is remarkable is the conclusion drawn from all this technical detail: \"Interplanetary space travel is possible....\" 30 This is the conclusion reached by analysis of all the preceding extensive technological summary. Yet, the document's own stated \"observed characteristic\" - speeds of a me re 1,200 MPH - do not support this conclusion at all, as was previously noted. One is in the presence, in other words, of two very different data-sets, even where the technology is concerned. However, it is equally crucial to observe that all other technological data points can be e xplained by reference to specific achievements of the Nazi secret weapons research. We will now consider these in detail. The metal of the craft, we are initially told, is some white-colored iron-basedmetal having the characteristics of high grade steel that was \"col d-formed and heat treated.\" 31 The process of forming and molding high tensile steel was in fact called \"cold extrusion\" and it was a technology that the Germans had perfected during the war. Moreover , the document also notes that the \"lack of wings, flaps, stabili zers, and surface control features suggests that the craft is a lifting body,\" 32 a design principle well in keeping with the most advanced German wartime research into discoid aerodynes. A further connection to known Nazi research inte rests is found in paragraph two: \"The low prof ile ratio of 6- to-l gives the aerodyne a great advantage in overc oming the restri ctions of the boundary layer effect...\" 33 The boundary layer, as we have already 30 Ibid., p. 75,par. 2. 31 Ibid., p. 69.,par. 1. 32 Ibid., p. 69,par. 4. 33 Ibid., par. 2. 297"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"seen, formed an early focal point of secret German research undertaken even before the beginning of the World War. But now the internal contradic tions in the document become stark and acute. For example, there is a curious juxtaposition and contradiction between paragraphs seven and eight. Paragraph seven states that \"there are no identifiable electronics (wiring, ignition...etc),\" 34 and yet, in the very bext paragraph, we are informed that, in the arrangement of technologies in the \"neutronic engine\" there are \"a series of co ils and heavy magnets connected to the neutronic engine via an oddl y arranged group of electrodes (metal not yet identified).\" 35 Coils and magnets certainly consitute \"identifiable electronics,\" so what is apparently really in view is the \"oddly arranged group of electrodes,\" suggesting that it is not the technology as such that is unusual, but its design and arrangement and combinations. And the description of this odd arrangement and spherical electronics sounds suspiciously like Hans Coler's \"coils\" and the Shneppeller devices previ ously examined. So here too, the document seems to point not so much to something extraterrestrial, but to something that, while exotic, was very terrestrial, and uniquely German. It is perhaps even significant that the document mentions a design feasture we en countered in the turbines and rotational devices of Viktor Schauberger: a \"helicoid mechanism.\" 36 One would expect from such advanced \"extraterrestrial\" technology such as this at least so me sort of solid state electronics and better speeds than a pa ltry 1,200 MPH and an engine constructed of coils and magnets \"oddly arranged.\" Then there is, from the terrestrial origins point of view another giveaway: \"The absence of provisions, berthing compartments and storage areas suggest that this craft may be a short range recconnaissance platform.\" 37 Certainly this statement could be made to fit with an \"ET\" explanation, but it is equally true that is is more appropriate to a terrestrial origins interpretation. 34 Ibid., p. 70, par. 7. 35 Ibid., par. 8. 36 Ibid. 37 Ibid., par. 9. 298"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Finally, the oddest mention in the whole of the document's Part II: a \"leaf book\" whose co ntents are apparently so sensitive that no part of the presumed summary of is contents is leaked. The entire description is blacked out. This is extremly interesting, and another point of internal contradiction, for in the light of the description of integrated circuitry encountered above and any culture possessing it, digital data storage is po ssible. Surely an advanced extraterrestrial culture with inte rplanetary travel capability would have a more advanced technology for data storage than a book. Yet there is no mention in the w hole document of anything that resembles digital data storage syst ems. There are no cassette tapes, no compact disks, no nothing. This is not to say that ET would not have, nor read, books. After all, we posses both technologies, and continue to use both. But in any case, it cannot be denied: a book is a totally terrestrial, and well-known, and old technology. Perhaps the most interesting tech nical descriptions, howver, are to be found in those portions de scribing the \"neutronic engine.\" Eleven components are described: (1) UF6 (i..e, uranium hexafluoride) in metallic form; (2) Hydrogen-fluoride gas; (3) \"water\" and uranium tetrafluoride; (4) powdered magnesium and potassium chlorate; (5) a \"metal similar to lead w ith a chocolate brown color\"; (6) U 235 in metallic form; (7) a plastic like material similar to (DuPont's) NE 102 (8) beryllium; (9) pure aluminum; (10) \"thorium isotope material\"; (11) plutonium powder. There are a number of very odd features about this list. First note that nine of the elev en components of the \"neutronic engine\" describe wholly terres trial - though for 1947 - still very advanced technologies. Second, note that the document states clearly that these elements \"were analyzed and found to exist in the small nuetronic 299"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"power plant. 38 So the elements were subjected to chemical and presumably other types of analys is, such as spect roscopy. One may even speculate where they were analyzed: close by in the Los Alamos lanoratories, one of the few facilities in the country at that time, and certainly the only one in New Mexico, capable of handling and analyzing such exotic and radioactive material. It is in this context that the third odd feature becomes evident, for the isotopic form of uranium - U 235 - is clearly specified, suggesting that the necessary tec hnique of analysis employed was precisly spectroscopy, since chemi cal analysis cannot separate- isotopes of the same element. We ma y also assume that this analysis indicated a high degree of purity, since one of the concerns of the scientists involved was precisely th at the uranium could be used for a bomb, which means that it was of weapons grade purity. And we may likewise safely assume that the plutonium present was Pu 240 the stable plutonium isotope. 39 With this in mind, a question immediately reps ents itself: Why is there an ambiguity when it comes to \"thorium isotope material?\" Was this because it was an unkn own isotope? Unlikely, since precision is indicated in the case of the uranium, and implied in the case of the plutonium. Was it therefore not specified for some other reason? We will never know. This leads to yet another oddity. There is a peculiar blend evident throughout this list of ve ry precise, and very ambiguous, descriptions that, given the importance of the subject matter, should not be glossed over. It may be th e case that there was not sufficient time to test and analyze everything precisely, but surely the presence of \"thorium isotope material\" merited further precision. In this respect, note once again taht uranium tetrafluoride and uranium hexafluoride are both precisely indicated, but again, with an imprecision: what was the isotopic form? This ambiguity is perhaps most evident in the mention of \"w ater,\" for one is left to guess whether this is ordinary water, or heavily deuterized or tritiumized 38 Ibid., p. 74, par. 18. 39 Another factor now should be noticed. The presence of these two elements without any mention of proper shielding indicates a serious technical flaw in the document, notwi thstanding its external indicators of authenticity. 300"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"heavy water. This imprecision occurs in the same context where earlier precision is the order of th e day, for in paragraph eight, \"heavy water\" and \"deuterium\" are mentioned as the \"primary ignitor\" of the neutronic engine. 40 In any case, these nine out of the eleven components are all known terrestrial technology, and given what has been covered in this book previously, weel within known German and American capabilities, and, for that time, onl y within German or American capabilities. In other words, if these are indicators pointing to a terrestrial origin for the craft, th en the only other possible place it can point to besides the United States, is the Nazi secrect weapons project and its possible postwar o ffshoots. This may be the reason why, then, when the two data-sets come into conflict at various points in the document, the ambiguity is obfuscated in favor of an extraterrestrial hypothesis of the craft's origin. One final note before proceeding with the examination of other documents from the Cooper-Cantwhe el Majic-12 series of paper; the mention of water and uranium tetrafluoride sggests the remote possibility that a highly radioactive solution was being employed, presumably to manipulate neutron emission in conjunction with the hydrodynamic properties of flui ds. This manipulation of radioactivity, field effects, and hydrodynamic properties - exotic by even today's standards - was al so, as was seen, one apparent principle behind the oper ation of Kammler's \"B ell\". Thus, even in its descriptions of the most ar cane aspects of the craft, the indications point clearly to Germany. While all these points constitute to my mind a very strong set of data points coupling the Roswell craft to the secret weapons research of Nazi Germ any and therefore to a possible terrestrial origin of \"ULAT-1\", the docum ent concludes with two very suggestive, and for that day, adva nced and revolutionary concepts that favor the \"ET\" explanation. Firs t, it states clea rly that \"Human origins may not be c onstrained to one planet. Our genus may be found among solar systems similar to our own.\" 41 The only possible foundations for this asto nishing conclusion woul d appear to be the 40 Ibid., p. 70, par. 8. 4 1 Ibid., p. 75, par. 5. 301"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"autopsies purportedly done on the recovered bodies, but also perhaps based upon anaylsis of th e contents of the \"leaf book discovered in the craft. But then an even more extraordinary comment follows: \"The laws of physics and genetics may have a genesis in a higher structured or der that (sic) once previously thought.\" 42 In 1947 physics was well on the path toward the grand theoretical constructs of the 196 0s, 70s, and 80s, having alrcady seen the higher dimensional theori es of Kaluza-Klein and other theories attempting such \"higher st ructured orders.\" But genetics and biology in genera l had then no similarl y grand and formally explicit conclusions beyond the theory of e volution, which was a long way from maintaining the gr and physics-biology union in a higher structured order manifest in the statement. Watson and Crick had yet to announce thei r discoveries, and S oviet physicists were still decades away fro m their astonishing wo rk in the physics of living systems and consciousness. So apparently something in that \"leaf book\" convinced the study group, during the short period from the crash in July to Sempte mber of 1947 when the report was actually completed, that there was a grande r union of physics and biology than anyone could scarcely have imagined. So what can be concluded from this one document? I think it is safe to say, that ta ken as a whole, with both data-sets viewed together, that it tends to favor niether the ET explanation nor the terrestrial origins explanation. Ho wever, when viewed separately, the biological information certainly tends to favor the ET origins hypothesis, and the technological information a terrestrial - and German - one. If one then places these two facts within the wider context of other events of 1947, and recalls al so the fact that the German Paperclip scientists were brought in because what was recovered \"looked all too familiar,\" then in that broad context the document seems to favor the terrest rial hypothesis. And as we have argued, that points clearly to Amer ica or Germany as the only two logical places such technology could have originated. On this speculative reading of the document, it seems clear then that the apparent contradictions are either deliberately created, or at 42 Ibid., p. 75, par. 6. 302"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"the minimum, obfuscated in fa vor of the ET explanation. The cover-up has already be gun. Can this type of analysis be sustained on technological information contai ned in the other great summary of data, the \"Air Accident Repo rt\" by General Nathan Twining? Indeed it can. 2. The 16 July 1947 Air Accide nt Report by General Nathan Twining to Headquarters: This document constitutes the next focus of technological interest, for it is General Nathan Twining's report to the Air Material Command (AMC) at Wr ight Field in Dayton, Ohio. Officially titled \"Air Accident Re port on 'Flying Disc' aircraft near the White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico,\" this report is of singular importance, as it contains the fi rst on-site technology descriptions and assess ments. In other words, these descriptions occur before the preliminary review of this September report we have just finished examining. Agai n, the main body of the report is cited almost in full: 1. As ordered by Presidential directive, dated 9 July 1947, a preliminary investigation of a recovered \"Flying Disc\" and remains of a possible second disc, was conducted by the senior staff of this command. The data furnished in this report was provided by the engineering staff personenel of T-2 and aircraft laboratory, Engineering Division T-3. Additional data was supplied by the scientific personnel of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, CIT and the Army Air Forces Scientific Advisory Group, headed by Dr. Theodore von Karman. Further analysis was conducted by personnel from Research and Development. 2. It is the collective view of this investigative body, that the aircraft recovered by the Army and Air Force units near Victorio Peak and Socorro, New Mexico, are not of US manufacture for the following reasons: a. The circular disc-shaped \"planform\" design does not resemble any design currently under development by this command nor of any Navy project. b. The lack of any external propulsion system, power plant, intake, exhaust either for propeller or jet propulsion, warrants this view. 303"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"c. The inability of the German scientists from Fort Bliss and White Sands Proving Ground to make a positive identification of a secret German V weapon out of these discs. Though the possibility that the Russians have managed to develop such a craft, remains. The lack of any markings, ID numbers or instructions in Cyrillic, has placed serious doubt in the minds of many, that the objects recovered are not of Russian manufacture either. d. Upon examination of the interior of the craft, a compartment exhibiting a possible atomic engine was discovered. At least this is the opinion of Dr. Oppenheimer (sic) and Dr. von Karman. A possibility exists that part of the craft itself comprises the propulsion system, thus allowing the reactor to function as a heat exchanger and permitting th e storage of energy into a substance for later use. This may allow the converting of mass into energy, unlike the release of energy of our atomic bombs. The description of the power room is as follows: (1) A doughnut shaped tube approximately thirty-five feet in diameter, made of what appears to be a plastic material, surrounding a central core (see sketch in Tab 1) This tube was translucent, approximately one inch this (sic), The tube appeared to be fill ed with a large rod centered inside the tube, was wrapped in a coil of what appears to be copper material, ran through the circumference of the tube. This may be the reactor cont rol mechanism or a storage battery. There were no moving parts decernable (sic) within the power room nor in MISSING LINE HERE. (2) This activation of a electrical (sic) potential is believed to be the primary power to the reactor, though it is only a theory at present. Just how a heavy water reactor functions in this environment is unknown. (3) Underneath the power plant, was discovered a ball- turret, approximately ten feet in diameter. This turret was encompassed by a series of gears that has a unusual (sic) ratio not known by any of our engineers. On the underside of the turret were four circular cavities, coated with some smooth material not identified. These cavities are symetrical (sic) but seem to be movable. Just how is not known. The movement of the turret coincides with the dome-shaped copula compartment above the po wer room. It is believed that the main prorpulsion system is a Modeless turbine, similar to current development now underway at AMC and the Mogul Project.

The air outside the craft would thus be ionized, thus propelling the craft forward. Coupled with the circular air foil for lift, the craft would presumably have an unlimited range and air speed This may account for the reported absence of any noise and the apparent blue flame often associated with rapid acceleration. (4) On the Deck of the power room there are what resembles typewriter keys, possibly reactor/powerplant controls. There were no conventional electronics not (sic) wiring to be seen connecting these controls to the propulsion turret. e. There is a flight deck located inside the copula section. It is round and domed at the top. The absence of canopy, observation windows/blisters, or any optical projection, lends support to the opinion that this craft is either guided by remote viewing or is remotely controlled. (1) A semi-circular photo-tube array (possibly television). (2) Crew compartments were hermetically sealed via a solidification process. (3) No weld marks, rivets or soldered joints. (4) Craft components appear to be molded and pressed into perfect fit. 44 There are a number of very sim ilar, and strikingly dissimilar features between this ealier doc ument and the later September \"White Hot Intelligenfce Estimate.\" First, it is to be noted that in this very first reoprt there is no mention whatsoever of the extratrerrestrial hypothesis as an explanation of the origin of the cr aft. Perhaps this is explained by the relatively brief time that ha d elapsed since the crash and the composition of the report, but it is unlikely for a very important reason. The report clearly states that the \"German scientists from Fort Bliss and White Sands Provi ng Ground\" were unable \"to make a positive identification of a scer et German V weapon\" from the 43 A Paperclip scientist. 44 Ibid., pp. 25-26, emphasis added. 305"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"discs. 45 This means that the question of origin was in view from the outset, and yet there is no mention of an extraterrestrial hypothesis. This reinforces our previous analys is of the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate\", for if the craft was susp ected of being extraterrestrial technology from the very beginning, brimming full of ultra- advanced ET technology, then it is very unlikely that the German rocket scientists would have been privy to the discovery at all, given the heavy American compartmentalization of secret research. In other words, to put the poin t once again, some thing about the craft immediately suggested a terr estrial and German provenance. By a similar line of re asoning, the German rocket scientists were not able to identify it as any Ge rman V-weapon. But this may be obfuscation of a sort, for as Corso has indicated, the Germans clearly told General Twining something that did not make it into either of his reports. Second, unlike the later \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate\", the element of \"mystification\" on the part of the investigators is relatively lacking in this initial report. This may obviously be due to the fact that the craft has not yet been more fully analyzed. Yet, the report itself provides an amount of detail that belies this explanation, for it was apparently kno wn in sufficient detail for von Braun and von Karman - who were una ble to identify the craft - to suggest a very radical form of pro pulsion via a charge differential, a fact that suggests that while they ma y not have been able to identify it, they at least may have had their strong suspicions. Third, the strangely and almost single-mindedly \"terrestrial\" nature of the technology described shoul d be clearly obvious: a simple plastic tube, approximately an inch in diameter, filled with a substance that is apparently water, in the center of which is a rod wrapped with a coil of \"what ap pears to be... copper material.\" 46 Moreover, apparently enough ex amination or analysis and speculation had been done for the i nvestigators to conclude that the doughnut reactor was somehow a \"heavy water\" reactor, 47 and that the German scientists are alread y thinking in te rms of a fusion 45 Ibid., p. 25. 46 Ibid. 47 Ibid., p. 26. 306"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"rather than a fission reactor. This is perhaps significant, for the equipment described, in the context of fusion, suggests the same apparatus set up, in so me respects, as the pr ocess later known as cold fusion. 48 Fourth, it is to be noted that the craft is described in similar terms to those in the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate\" in the fact that it has \"no weld marks, rivets or soldered joints.\" 49 But this similarity highlights th e fifth point, and a significant new difficulty. In the previously examined \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate,\" a certain emphasis was placed by that report on the apparent lack of conventional means of control: push-buttons, knobs, toggle switches, and so on. \"Biosensory\" control was posited, and these two facts supported an extraterrestrial explanation of the craft's origin. Moreover, the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate,\" it will bee recalled, emphasized the absence of crew quarters, which it will be recalle d, suggested a short range reconnaissance platform. However, here in his very first report, Twining states that \"crew compartments were hermetically sealed: and that the means of visual steeri ng of the craft was (suggestively) by \"remote viewing,\" followed imme diately by mention of \"a semi- circular photo-tube arra y (possibly television).\" 50 Thus, either this very first report is describing a diffe rent craft than that described in the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimat e,\" or a very deliberate change has been made by the tim e of the latter's co mposition, which does not mention a \"photo-tube array\" at all, but stresses rather the complete lack of any such conve ntional technologies such as vacuum tubes. 51 48 That von Braun and von Karman are clearly thinking along cold fusion lines is evident from the fact that a me re plastic tube, much less the presumed heavy water within it, would have been blasted away in millionths of a second by the extreme heat present at the initiation of any hot fusion reaction. 49 Ibid. 50 Ibid. 51 It should be noted, however, that the Whit e Hot Intelligence Estimate stresses this lack in connection with the propulsion system, and not the control system, of the craft. It does mention te levision as a possibilit y for visual control and coordination of the craft, yet fails to mention the \"photo-tube array\" of the Air Accident Report. 307"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"And finally, the sixth point. In the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate,\" emphasis is placed on th e lack of control features inside the craft. Yet, in the \"Air Accide nt Report,\" a ve ry conventional, very terrestrial set of \"what resembles typewriter keys, possibly reactor/powerplant controls\" were found. 52 These very terrestrial sounding \"typewriter keys\" are not th e only piece of hardware that do not sound like ultra-advanced solid state ET technology, for perhaps the most perplexing aspect of the \"Air Accident Report's\" power plant description is the fact that the \"ball-turret\" component of the assembly was \"encompassed by a series of gears that has an unusual ratio not known by any of our engineers.\" 53 Gears!!?? Does this advanced ET heav y water doughnut cold fusion reactor with typewriter keys come with automatic, or just standard? For the reader who has been paying attention, however, the description of the craft in the \"Air Accident Report,\" as distinct from that in the \"White Hot Inte lligence Estimate,\" sounds very similar to descriptions of the various advanced technologies the Nazis were trying to perfect. And the clincher is the \"bladeless turbine,\" that was apparently under development at the Air Materials Command and in the Mogul Project. 54 Viktor Schauberger's \"Repulsine\" sauc er, developed for the Nazis, involved just such a bladeless turbine. Taken on its own then, the \"Air Acci dent Report\" has little in it to suggest an extraterre strial explanatio n, and a grea t deal in it that sounds all too uncomf ortably like the secret research of the Kammlerstab. Notably, once again one senses that \"conventional\" though still highly advanced technologies were not the most unusual feature of the craft to catch the investigators' attention. The unusual aspect that commanded it was rather their unusual and sophisticated combination: doughnut heavy water fusion reactors with gears and ball-turrets. 52 Ibid. 53 Ibid. 54 Ibid. 308"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Taken together, these two documen ts begin to suggest that a \"story\" is beginning to take shape in the secret counsels of what will become the Majic-12 group. First, the German Paperclip scie ntists were brought in, most likely because something about the cr aft - this very same feature of unusual combinations of technologies - suggested to the high American brass a very terrestrial , very German, origin. Second, while the technologies and their unusual comb inations of them suggested by these two documents are not sufficiently advanced to argue persuasively for the ET explanation, they are sufficiently advanced enough to conclude that they constituted a significant national security threat and i ssue. Somebody, somewhere, must have appeared to the high Ameri can brass-in-the-know, and we can only assume that General Twinin g was one such general officer, that someone somewhere was cont inuing, independ ently, the lines of reearch begun by the Kammlerstab. This required in turn a new intelligence and research-develop ment agency with the highest security classification a nd direct responsibility to the President. In short, //there was an independently surviving Nazi research black project, and if the Roswell crashe d vehicle(s) gave sufficient evidence of this fact, then the shock waves this must have sent through the corridor s of power in the Pent agon must have been unimagineable. All the better then to cloak the sensational discovery in a multi-layered disinformation operation, to conceal it, as Nick Cook suggested, behind the ET Myth. But there is an other hypothesis that is also suggested by the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate\", a nd that is that very possibly the truth was a combination of the two, that the first crash and recovery took place in Europe, and became the basis of a massive and very secret Nazi black projects effort to back engineer it. As we shall see at the end of this chapter, there is surprising conf irmation of this idea from a little suspected source, a source often overlooked in histories of the Second World Wa r and its rapid technological advancements. We will return to further development of this scenario in connection with the Nazi UFO Legend after we have examined the third document dealing with the technological aspects of the Roswell incident. This is 309"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"3. The Fall 1952 Majestic Twelve Project First Annual Report: This report should be viewed in conjunction with the two reports just examined, for it is th e considered and calm review, now some five years form the event, of the highest levels of the agency established as a result of the Roswell Incident. As such, its descriptions of the recovered t echnology are of crucial significance, for by comparison one can ascertain the progress, or lack thereof, made in the intervening years in analyzing the recovered technologies. Moreover, one can an alyze the progress, or lack thereof, of the ET interpretation first tenatively suggested in the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate.\" At the ouset, The \"First Annua l Report\" clearly rules out a terrestrial explanation almost fr om the very beginning of the document: \"All efforts have been ma de to identify the country or private concern (which) could ha ve the technical and financial resources necessary to produce such a long-range flight. So far, no country on this earth has the means and the security of its resources to produce such.\" 55 The chronological pr ogression of the ET hypothesis, from no mention in the \"Air Accident Report,\" to an initially tentaive and later str onger mention in the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate,\" has now ended with the ET hypothesis alone being the consider ed view of the group. The signal question to be addressed in the examination of this document is whether or not the evidence it cites sufficiently supports and compels to that conclu sion. Or does it too fall into the pattern of internal co nflicts of data-sets ev idenced in the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate,\" presenti ng evidence that may have more terrestrial, and for that very reason, more sensational and extraordinary implications? Preceding to the first piece of evid ence advanced in favor of its chosen extraterrestrial explanation, the \"Fir st Annual Report\" like the \"White Hot Intellige nce Estimate\" before it clearly indicates that the recovered bodies are the strongest evid ence in favor of that explanation: \"The occupants of th ese panform vehicles are, in most 55 Ibid., p. 106. 310"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"respects, human or human-like. Autopsies, so far indicate, that these being (sic) share the same biological needs as humans.\" 56 It is to be noted that this is the firs t piece of evidence presented in the document, and thus to the MJ-12 group, it has already eclipsed in importance the significant technological recoveries. But then in the very next sec tion, two rather disturbing pieces of information are presented in very succinct fashion, without undo fanfare or preparation in the body of the docu ment preceding them: \"MAJESTIC SS&P,\" we are informed, \"are currently focused on Psy-Op development for Cold War (counter-intelligence) activities.\" 57 Then in the very next sentence comes a stunning admission: \"Utilization of Paperclip specialists has yielded valuable results in new weapons research in areas of flight dynamics, biological and chemical agents , mind control, and intelligence gathering techniques.\" 58 Ponder what has now been admitted: Majestic-12, allegedly established as a super-secret research, development, and intelligence agency, is already en gaged - almost Ahnenerbe style - in psychological operations, em ploying Nazi scientists and \"specialists\" in ne w weapons developmen t, including \"mind control\" and \"intellige nce gathering technique s.\" What has any of this to do with back-engineer ing alien flying saucers(whether terrestrial or extraterrestrial), unless a psychological warfare operation was considered to be essential for counter-intelligence purposes? Was the \"ET\" explanation being advanced as an integral component of that operation? Th e beginning of this agenda was already beginning to ma ke its presence felt as early as the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate,\" but there is not the slightest hint of it in the \"Air Accident Report.\" 59 56 Ibid., p. 106. 57 Ibid., p. 107. 58 Ibid. 59 And now another curious feature should be evident. The \"Air Accident Report\" nowhere mentions any recovered bodies, extraterrestrial or otherwise, certainly a curious omission if in fact th ere were such bodies present at one of the crash sites. Or was the problem simply that they were the wrong kind of bodies? 311"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"A lengthy section of the document then lollows outlining in detail the various areas for long-range technological exploitation and development, ranging provocatively enough from \"retro- viruses\" and other biologi cal warfare and pharmaceutical development, to minaturization of \"atomic bomb components\" and \"aircraft and missile design,\" to \"new machining techniques...for high-temperature alloys and titan ium\" for \"space exploration and hypersonic dynamics.\" 60 Clearly by the time of this \"First Annual Report\" a great deal of research has alread y been done. But the resemblance with the broad mi ssion brief and portfolio of Kammler's think tank is readily a pparent, doubtless because of the presence of the Paperclip \"special ists\" within the organization, for in five short years, what began as a \"modest\" back-engineering and technology recovery black proj ect has ballooned into a mega- bureaucracy coordinating almost all broad areas of American black projects secret weapons resear ch. Minus the death camps, of course, Majic-12 is almost the mi rror image of the Kammlerstab. Is it the presence of Nazis, working in the deepest recesses of these black projects, that explains the US military's experimentation on Black American and other minority US citizens and solders, groups that such Nazis consider ed to be racially in ferior? It is a profound moral question that cannot be pondered too long. In any case, the document indicates that the propulsion technology of the craft is a major focus of effort: The AEC and NEPA are currently conducting research for advanced technologies in atomic engines and radical propulsion studies. Systems studies at Los Alamos, N.M., Aak Ridge, Tenn., and at Langley, Va., are attempting to duplicate the water drive and plastic core elements found on the engine being kept at HAFB.

But then at this juncture the technological \"Annexes\" are appended, the first of which, Annex A, contains information on the recovered craft and their occupants. 1. The Panel's review of the AEC and AFSWP investigation of Site L- 1 and he Air Force Site L-2, has led the Panel to conclude that the objects under study, are the result of a high altitude ejection of a escape (sic) cylinder from a fatal mid-air collision of two unidentified circular planform aircraft of interplanetary nature. 2. Of particular interest to the Panel was site L-2, located at Lat 33-40- 31, Long 106-28-29, as this site yielded the most material for analysis. 3. Site L-2 may be closely associated with Site L-l, and debris pattern suggests that the craft hit the ground at a sharp angle and continued to remain airborne until coming to rest at site L-2. 4. The craft found at Site L-2, is either the remains of a rocket-plane, or a powered glider. What remained of the power plant was examined and determined to be of a magnetic drive propulsion powered by a fusion reactor of sorts. 5. Lack of wiring, fuel systems, cables, motors, hydraulics, intakes, exhaust, and surface controls, strongly suggests that the craft was designed to travel outside of our atmosphere. 6. The second craft that impacted at Site L-3, provided very little evidence that it too was similar in design, as the impact was vertical in nature and at very high speed. It is believed that the debris discovered on 2 July 1947, by a local rancher was the result of a mid-air collision with an X-plane from HAFB; another unidentified object; or possibly collided with both.

The Panel was concerned over the contamination of several SED personnel upon coming in contact with debris near the power plant. One technician was overcomed and collapsed (sic) when he attempted the removal of a body. Another medical technician went into a coma four hours after placing a body in a rubber body-bag. All four were rushed to Los Alamos for observation. All four later died of seizures and profuse bleeding. All four were wearing protective suits when they came into contact with body fluids from the occupants. 9. Autopsies on the four dead SED technicians are not conclusive. It is believed that the four may have suffered from some form of toxin or a highly contagious desease(sic). Tissue samples are currently being kept at Fort Detrick, Md. 10 The panel was also concerned with the detection of air-borne monitor flights over the Site L-2. Radiation readings indicate a high neutron count was recorded as the plane flew over the site. Neutron count dropped off as th e plane flew a considerable distance from the site. A report has been filed with the USAIDS. 11. Detection of a high altitude explosion was recorded by a Project MOGUL constant level ballon on 4 July 1947. Radar from White Sands Proving Ground and HAFB also detected a surge. 12. Parachute recovery team from HAFB were dispatched to Site L-2. Upon arrival, the team, realizing th e nature of the crash, radioed instructions and marked the crash site for the investigators that arrived later. 13. In the opinion of the senior AEC medical officer, current medical equipment and supplies are wholly inadequate in dealing with a large scale outbreak of alien virus. 14.

On 26 September 1947, the first meeting of the NSC-1 was held to discuss the Now Mexico incidents and how to implement the policy established by MJ-12 SS&P. 65 What emerges from this annex is actually very little new technical data, but the lingering sense of anbiguity that hovered over the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimat e\" is resolved by the new information that there were two, possibly more, craft involved, one of which was a powered \"glider\". 66 Note again that the strongest evidence presented for the extraterrestrial hypothesis in the do cument is the recovery of bodies and their apparently quite toxic e ffects on humans. This scenario is not far-fetched, for similar results attended the first contact between Europeans and American Indians, whose respective systems had built up different immunities. Finally, note the strange tran sformation of Project MOGUL from a program apparently initially involving bladeless turbines, to a project involving the launching of constant altitude balloons to monitor Soviet nuclear tests! So what can one make of all three docume nts together? As we have already observed, theere is a curious progression, from the initial \"Air Accident Report\", in which an etraterrestrial explanation is not even mentioned, to the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate,\" in which both options are left open initially, but in which the ET hypothesis becomes the privileged model of interp retation, to the \"First Annual Report\", where onl y the ET hypothesis is seriously entertained. This highlights a possible scenario of what happened. Let us first consider what happened at the Roswell incident along the ET paradigm. This paradigm and interpretation have gained such status within the UFO community that, extraordinary as it is, it now seems almost co mmonplace. Unusual debris of some strange material is discovered by a local rancher in a field. Bodies 65 Ibid., pp. 112-113, emphasis added. 66 It should be noted, however, that the clear implication of the language of the \"Air Accident Report,\" and even more of the \"White Hot Intelligence Estimate,\" is that there are more than one crash site, therefore strong suggesting more than one crashed vehicle. 315"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"are found and autopsied. They are small and human-like and cause the deaths of some of the medica l personnel who first handled them. A propulsion unit is found that is highly advanced. The story goes out on the newspaper wire: the army has recovered a crashed flying saucer, while at the same time General Twining is issuing his \"Air Accident Report\" in which no mention is made of the ET hypothesis at all. Witnesses are inte rviewed and the public reaches a conclusion: We have been visite d by ET. And this is indeed a plausible scenario that fits some of the facts alleged in the reports on the incident. But there are considerable t echnological problems with this interpretation. If the cr ashed vehicles were even suspected of being of ET origin, then why call in the German Paperclip scientists, and then keep them in the loop long after the ET hypothesis has become the official though top secret explana tion? It is far more likely that they were consulted because some at a very high level in the US military had seen this technology before. In fact, if it was German saucer or some later development that crashed in New Mexico, if the \"leaf book\" mentioned by the \"W hite Hot Intelligence Estimate\" was \"alien\" in the sense of foreign but terrestrial, then the miltary's alarm becomes paradoxically more understandable. In 1947 the war was already two years over. Yet, here was a crashed vehicle with all the signatures one came to rec ognize from Kammler's advanced research projects. Where did it come from? A cover-up on this view would have been as necessary, if not much more so, from the military's point of view as on the view that it was a crashed ET vehicle. In this event, the stra ngeness of the re covered technology would have suggested a plausibl e foundation for a deep layer of disinformation planted in the reports themselves, to be disseminated when weather balloons and monkey bodies were no longer capable of holding back the ET flood. There would have been no records of such an understanding, 67 it would have been arrived at in oral discussions, and \"worked into\" the otherwise reliable information contained in its classified reports. 67 In this respect, consider carefully the statements of Colonel Corso in the epigrams that began this chapter. 316"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"In this respect, it is perhaps significant that some contemporary observers of the American space program and its odd thirty-year long \"holding pattern\" and tapestry of inconsistencies, lies, and obfuscations have long suspected that there are indeed two space programs inside the US government, the \"public NASA one, and a quasi-independent one based deep w ithin covert and black projects. In 1970, a curious docume nt based upon the Garrison Investigation's voluminous files, called the \"Nomenclature of an Assassination Cabal\" , otherwise known as the Torbitt document, was circulated, alleging a connect ion between this secret space program and the murder of Presid ent John F. Kennedy. Radio talk show conspiracy theorist Mae Bru ssel concurred: the secret space program was being run inside and quasi-independently of the public NASA program, and both were be ing coordinated by Wernher von Braun. In this connection it is perhap s informative that the last document in the Cantwheel Majestic -12 documents is a Top Secert memo from November 12, 1963, - a scant ten days before the assassination - from President Ke nnedy to the Director of Counter Intelligence of the Central Intelligence Agency: SUBJECT: Classification review of all UFO intelligence files affecting National Security.

It is important that we make a clear distinction between the knowns and the unknowns in the event the Soviets try to mistake our extended cooperation as a cover for intelligence gathering of their defence (sic) and space programs. When this data has been sorted out, I would like you to arrange a program of data sharing with NASA where Unknowns are a factor. This will help NASA mission directors in their defensive responsibilties. I would like an interim report on the data review no later than February 1, 1964. /s/ John F.

D. Russians, Terrorists, Asteroid s and Aliens: The Rosin Affidavit But perhaps the most chilling a nd corroborative bit of evidence of a secret space program and ag enda was left by Wernher von Braun himself. Dr. Carol Rosin, a close associate of the former Nazi cum-NASA director and the first woman corporate manager of Fairchild Industries, gave an affidavit to Dr. Steven Greer's \"Disclosure Project\" in the Sp ring of 2001. Rosin recounts something that she alleges von Braun repeatedly told her: What was most interesting to me was a repetitive sentence that he said to me over and over again during the approximately four years that I had the opportunity to work with him. He said the strategy that was being used to educate the public and decision makers was to use scare tactics.... That was how we identify an enemy. The strategy that Werner von Braun taught me was that first the Russians are going to be considered the enemy.... Then terrorists would be identified, and that was soon to follow... Then we were going to identify third-world country \"crazies\". We now call them Nations of concern. But he said that would be the third enemy against whom we would build space-baed weapons. The next enemy was asteroids. Now, at this point he kind of chuckled the first time he said it. Asteroids - against asteroids we are going to build space-based weapons. 69 And the funniest one of all was what he called aliens, extratererstrials. That would be the final scare. And over and over 69 Implying, incidentally, an immense destructive power - a one-shot planet-busting capacity - for such weapons, for such power they would have to possess to be of any use against an astero id large enough to destroy the earth, or large enough to threaten all life on it. 318"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"during the four years that I knew him and was giving speeches for him, he would bring up that last card. \"And remember Carol, the last card is the a l i e n card.

An Unlikely Source: Benito Mussolini's Secret RS/33 UFO- Marconi Study Group: The Original Italian \"MJ-12\" Documents But how could Dr. Wernher von Braun, Paperclip rocket \"specialist\", speaking in the early 1970s, be so exactingly prescient in his prediction of the exact sequ ence of \"enemies\"? One answer, that of the \"Torbitt\" document, is of course that he himself was a senior \"insider\", privy to the plots and canards of the innermost conspiracies driving western politics and culture. However, another source of mate rial has emerged only recently that might afford a clue as to how long UFOs have been being secretly studied and attempts made to back engineer them for some time. In the year 2000, very secret papers from the archives of the Italian government were deliberately leaked to Italian UFOfologists. Unlike the MJ-12 documents, howe ver, these documents were not 70 Steven M, Greer, M.D. , Disclosure: Military and Government Witnesses reveal the Greatest Secrets in Modern History (Crozer, Virginia: 2001), pp. 255-256. 319"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"films, nor photocopies, but the actual handwritten notes and original files and telegrams, on original paper, with original ink. This allowed documents experts from the University of Bologna to do an exhaustive analysis of the paper and inks and style of writing of the telegrams. The conclusion? The documents were undoubtedly authentic. The story they contained was no thing less than explosive, for they told how, in response to various UFO sightings in the north of Fascist Italy in 1933, and Italian Air Force scrambles to intercept the intruders, that Benito Mussolini had established the first state level black projects UFO study group, under the direction of the famous Italian physicist and in ventor Marconi. The group, like a much later American project, a ssembles reports, photographs, witness testimonies, and developed a classi fication system for various types of sightings. The gr oup was classified at the highest level by Mussolini. When Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany concluded the Rome-Berlin Axis, Mussolini tr ansferred, often literally shipping this treasure trove of information to Nazi Germany, where it most likely made its way eventually into the hands of the SS. In any case, On February 23, 1941, as the war clouds between th e Axis and the United States were growing dark er, Mussolini made one of his characteristically blunt statements. He said, \"It's far more likely that the United States will be invaded by unknown but warlike inhabitants from the planet Mars , who will come down from the starry space on unimaginable flyi ng fortresses, than from the soldiers of the Axis.\" A strange statement indeed, even for a man who excelled in making unpredictable pronouncements. What does all this sugge st? First, that at the deepest level, a profoundly advanced terrestrial rather than extraterrestrial technology was behind at least some of the facts associated with Roswell. This technology and its us e in unusual combinations points quite clearly to Germany. Second, it means that at a level still deep, but less so, there is an extraterrest rial aspect that may be part of a disinformation operation and deep-c over story, or that may have entered the picture nearly a decade and a half before Roswell. 320"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"In any case, in the light of th e fact that as more and more documents are leaked, released, or declassified from the World War Two era, perhaps the most signifi cant lesson to be learned is that one should perhaps be more cautious in ascribing an \"ET\" origin to such events and sightings with out first having considered the terrestrial alternatives, no matter ho w disquieting those alternatives maybe.

The \"Bell\" The most sensational piece of information on Nazi secret research to come out since the re unification of Ge rmany - indeed, since the origins of the Nazi \"UFO \" Legend itself- is the story told by Nick Cook in his Quest for Zero Point, which appeared in the U.K. in 2001. The story is, additiona lly, the only real solid piece of corroboration of the Nazi UFO Lege nd to appear since the war, based, as as it is, on a secret an d recently declassified Polish war crimes trial affadavit of a former SS general. \"The Bell\" (German: die Glocke ) represented something at the very pinnacle of Kammler's grizzly and super-secret SS \"wonderweapons\" empire. Cook's book represents the only publicly accessible information on this bizarre object in the English language, the equally macabre experimentation that surrounded it, and the stringent security the SS he ld it under. Th e following are the salient features of The Bell, according to Cook: (1) The Belli was reportedly a metallic object, approximately 9' in diameter and 12-15' tall; (2) It loocked like a \"Bell\", hence its codcname to the Germans, die Glocke; 1 Nick Cook, The Hunt for Zero Point, p. 270. 2 Cited in Jonathan Vankin, Conspiraci es.

The Bell, along with General Kammler himself, simply disa ppear entirely from history, never to be seen again. (8) A strange \"henge\" like stru cture was constructed by the Germans out of reinforced conc rete near the facility where the Bell was located and tested . This structure resembled a test rig for the possible test of extremely powerful propulsion devices. 12 Cook also notes that, at the end of the war, Kammler had special jurisdiction over a secret \"SS ev acuation command\" that had been personally established by Reichsle iter Martin Bormann in great secrecy. This command included jurisdiction over all of Nazi Germany's heavy-lift ultra-long ra nge transport airc raft, including the Ju-290 and the six engined monster, the Ju-390, that we encountered in part one. These plan es were based at the end of the war quite near the se cret underground facilit y where the Bell was being tested. Before proceeding, it would be useful to note a few things about this strange list of properties. First, whatever the Bell was, Kammler's SS apparently thought its secrets were so valuable, that anyone connected with its construction and/or test ing had to be executed at the end of the war to prevent these from being leake d, presumably to the Russians, since the Bell was located and tested in Silesia, in what would later become Poland and East Germany. Second, we note again the use of concentration camp inmates to perform the dangerous, and one can only presume, eventually lethal, operation of cleaning the test chamber after each experimentation with the Bell. Th is fact places this mysterious object firmly within Kammler's SS secret weapons black projects empire. It is entirely possible that the Bell represented something so sophisticated in terms of its pr inciples of operat ion, that the then only known tesimony and descriptions of the Bell in his affidavit to a post-war Polish war crimes trial, for whic h he was convitcd and executed. 12 Cook, op. cit, pp. 197-198. 333"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"existing technology could not offer a sufficient means of protection for the important personnel involved in the experiments. Hence, concentration camp inmates may have been used as fodder to enable the experiments to go forw ard. Any breakthroughs the Bell represented were thus accomplished by this means, at enormous human cost. Finally, certain properties about the Bell should be noted, since they constitute unusual data points that will be examined in connection with the Kecksbur g \"UFO crash\". These are: • Heavy electrical power consumption; • Rotation of a radioactive liqu id in two co unter-rotating cylinders; • An unusual radioactive liquid metal of unknown composition; • Its location in a chamber line d with ceramic bricks and rubber mats. The rotation of the object, and pr esumably the radioactive liquid- metal called \"Xerum 525\", suggests that the Germans were investigating the inertial and vo rtex properties of radioactive material when subjected to high speed rotati on, as well as the resulting field effects. It is likel y that this rotation was caused by passing a current through the liquid - hence the high power consumption - but the possibility of mechanical rotation should not be ruled out in addition to this, as German progress in jet engine turbines and uranium centrifuges would have given them the experience to construct very high speed turbines for rotating such material for study. In this sense, it is possible that the Bell was nothing more than two counter-rota ting ultra-high speed turbines That is to say, the Bell may have been an ultra high speed electro- mechanical turbine of some sort, an offshoot, perhaps, of German centrifuge technology development. The housing of this device in an underground chamber lined with ceramic brick and rubber ma ts suggests that it gave off extremely strong electro-magnetic or electro-static field effects as well as high heat when in operati on. The reporting of metallic tastes 334"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"in the mouths of what few surviv ing personnel there are suggests this. The quick decay without apparent putrefaction of organic material within its field suggests effects that some would associate with scalar waves. But what was the mysterious \"X erum 525\"? When I first read of this strange materi al, I thought it might be some radioactive isotope of mercury, or possibly a more radi oactive substance in chemical solution of some sort. It is perhaps worth noting that recently a strange substance know n as \"red mercury\", or mercury antominate oxide, has been alleged to have strong neutron emitting properties when subjected to sudden explosive stress, and is alleged to be a non-fissile method of tr iggering the enormous fusion reactions of hydrogen bombs, as well as being able, in its own right, of fission explosions in the small kiloton ra nge. Perhaps the Nazis had stumbled onto a similar such substance during the war. It was on the basis of certain fe atures of the above lists of the Bell's properties that I hypothesized in my previous book, The Giza Death Star Deployed, that the obj ect that crashed in the famous Kecksburg UFO crash retrieval case might have been the Bell itself. In that book, I did not explore that hypothesis, leaving it for \"another book.\" Well, this is th at \"other book\", and it is now necessary to examine the odd data points that seem to connect these two mysterious objects. B. The UFO Crash and Retrieva l at Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, December 1965 Twenty years after Kammler' s \"Bell\" went missing, a remarkably similar object repo rtedly crashed in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, in a wooded area in the country. The story of the Kecksburg incident begins at ap proximately 4:45 PM, December 9, 1965. From northern Canada to west ern Pennsylvania, thousands of witnesses described \"an orange fireball tearing acoss the evening sky towards the south east, followed by a trail of smoke.\" 13 Witnesses included pilots spread throughout Ontario, Michigan, and Ohio that were al ong the flight path of the object. Once over 13 Michael Hesemann, UFOs Secret History, p 167. 335"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"Ohio, however, th e object clearly demonstrated that it was not a typical meteor, nor a crash in the ordinary sense of \"space debris,\" for according to witnesses, it stopped, stood still \"for a few seconds\" and then changed its course towards Pennsylvania. 14 At this point, the Kecksburg saga begins in earnest, for at 4:47 PM, a Mrs. Jones called the local radio station WHJB in Greensburg and told reporter John Murphy that \"a huge fireball has crashed in the woods a bout 1.5 miles from here.\" 15 Her children had been playing outside when they first saw it, describing it as a burning star. Mrs. Jones, visiting a neighbor at that time on then porch, saw blue smoke coming from the forest and a bright light hovering above the area. 16 In the meantime, the reporter John Murphy had already driven to the site, finding already a beeh ive of activity there, with two police cruisers and a fire engine from the local volunteer fire- department parked at the wood's edge. After questioning Mrs. Jones and her children, the local fire marshal and one of the policemen walked into the forest, and reemerged sixteen minutes later. In response to reporter Murphy's questio ns, the fire marshal directed him to his lawyer! 17 What follwed over the next few hours was genuinely bizarre, as the US Army and Air Force, and apparently some NASA scientists and technicians, 18 literally moved in and pl aced the tiny village and its environs under virtual martial law: Whatever it was that had crashed in the forest, the Army and Air Force marched up to deal with it. The military and state police cordoned off the forest area, stati oned armed guards at all the roads 1 4 Hesemann, op. cit, p. 167. 1 5 Ibid. 1 6 Ibid., p. 168. 1 7 Ibid. 1 8 Q.v.

The Air Force took over the premises of the local voluntary fire station and se t up a commando (sic) post there. The firemen, now forbidden to enter the station, stood by watching while persons in military uniform brought in more equipment into the station, which included a huge radio transmitter. A little later, two large transport trucks, one of them bearing the insignia of the army, were seen driving into the forest. At about the same time, people living close to the nearby Latrobe Airfield saw a jet plane landing there, although the airfield itself had been closed to traffic for quite some time. 19 Later, television, newspaper, and radio reporters arrived from Pittsburg, to be met with a wall of silence from the military. But a police spokesman stated \"t here's an unidentified flying object in the woods.\" When the US Air Force's Project Blue book was contacted, Major Hector Quintanilla himself, then project head, informed the reporters that the Air Force's investigators were already at the site. 20 If it were only for the offici al statements and peculiar \"overreaction\" of the military in su ch a quick response to the event, and in placing an entire town and considerable portion of its environs under virtual martial la w and placing a secure perimter around a Pennsylvania wood, little else would have been known of the Kecksburg crash. Ho wever, a local who ha d been listening to the radio, Bill Bulebush, made his wa y to the crash site, thinking to offer help to local authorities and the presumed crash victims. When he arrived, however, he saw \"something that threw him for a loop\": A metallic bullet-shaped object was sticking in the ground at the end of a trench, which it had obviously formed while landing. \"It looked like a big burned orange. It sparkled and twinkled, was about 9 feet wide and 12 feet long. Somehow it gave me the creeps and I got away quickly.\" And when he read the Ai r Force explanation in the papers the next day, he knew they were lying. What he had seen had certainly not been a meteorite! 21 1 9 Hesemann, op. cit., p. 168. 20 Ibid., p. 169. 2 1 Ibid., emphasis in the original. 337"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Suffice it to say, it strains credib ility to have so many witnesses attest that the military showed up, placed an area of U.S. territory under martial law, and called in NASA specialists, to recover a mere meteorite. The meteorite theo ry made no sense to local UFO researcher Stan Gordon either, since UFOs ordinarily traveled at speeds in excess of those calculated for the object, and metorites do not stop, stand still, and then change course. Nonetheless, there the matter w ould have rested, until James Romansky came forward as a w itness 2 years later (1987). Romansky had been 19 years old at the time of the incident, and a member of the volunteer firefighting team that had arrived first and been instructed to co mb the woods for the wr eckage of a crashed airplane. 22 Romansky gave a description of the object that was slightly different than Bulebush's in certain details: It had the shape of an acorn, made of shining silvery metal which had a light touch of gold in it. Its bottom was surrounded by a kind of ring or, as Jim put it, a kind of metal bumper on which strange writing could be seen. Romansky described it later. \"They looked like Egyptian hieroglyphics, but without any animal signs. There were straight and broken lines, dots, squares and circles.\" .... There was no glass, no propeller or jet nozzle, no burst tanks from which any fuel had leaked out, and not even the sign of a hatch or entrance. 23 After Romansky's story was aired on an episode of the television show \"Unsolved Mysteries\", othe r witnesses emerged with their own accounts of the incident, and substantially confirmed the account, adding new details of their own. One of these details was that a late-night convoy of trucks, one including a large flatbed semi-tra iler with an object covered in a tarpaulin. Some witnesses report that the tarpaulin was pulled tighly around the object, and its \"acorn\" sh ape could clearly be seen. The object was next seen by witnesses at its first apparent destination, Lockborne Air Force base in Colu mbus, Ohio, where military police 22 Hesemann, op. cit., p. 169. 23 Ibid., emphasis in the original. 338"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"units were ordered to surround a hangar and shoot anyone who attempted to enter that did not have a top secret clearance. 24 It was next apparently seen by a witness, \"Myron\", who contacted Stan Gordon, and descri bed a similar object. Hesemann's summary of Myron's story is wort h citing in full, since it bears directly on my hypothesis: (Myron) worked as a truck driver fo r a cement factory belonging to his family at Dayton, Ohio. Two days after the incident occurred at Kecksburg, his firm received a large order for specially glazed bricks from the Wright Patterson Air Field. A representative of the base had had a look at the bricks in stock at the factory and finally ordered 6,500 double-glazed processed bricks, which, he said, \"were for building a double-walled shield around a recovered radioactive object. \" 25 Myron later glanced inside the hangar to view what was inside. The object was silhouetted by floodlights behind large silk - parachute-like screens. Myron described \"the shadowy outlines of a large bell-shaped object....perhaps about 9 feet wide and 12 feet high. Through a small opening in th e tent, Myron co uld see that it was metallic, like some ki nd of whitish bronze.\" 26 C. Analysis There are a number of curious data points that would appear to connect Kammler's \"Bell\" with Kecksburg's \"Acorn\". Hesemann's book, from which the ab ove accounts and quot ations were cited, was published in 1998, before Nick Cook's Hunt for Zero Point, with its summarization of SS General Sporrenberg's descriptions of the Bell were first made known to an English speaking audience. This means that the Kecksburg witnesses record something that sounds eerily like Kammler's Bell. Consider the following list: 24 Ibid, pp. 169-170. 25 Hesemann, pp. 179-170, emphasis added. 26 Ibid., p. 173. 339"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"(1) Both objects arc described in very similar terms, as \"acorn\" or \"bell\" shaped; th e Pennsylvania witnesses could just as easily be describing Kammler 's Hell, and Sporrenberg similarly, could just as easily be desc ribing the Kecksburg Acorn; (2) Both objects are described as having similar, if not identical, dimensions, being approximately 9 to 12 feet in diameter and 12 to 15 feet in height; (3) Both objects had to be hous ed in a chamber made of \"glazed\" or \"ceramic\" bricks, because, (4) Both objects apparently gave off strong radioactivity or other strong field effects. In fact, it is on only one point that the two objects differ, if indeed they are two distinct objects, and th at is the consistent testimony by witnesses who actually saw the Keck sburg \"acorn\" UFO, that some strange form of writing existed around the \"bumper\" of the object, resembling heirog lyphics to some, \"but without the animal and people pictures,\" as James Romansky puts it, and resembling geometrical forms according to a few others. No similar statements exist for Kammler's Bell. But even this may not necessar ily be a sufficient reason to dismiss the possible connection. Th e kind of writing described may have been a form of runes, a form of writing in which the occult- oriented SS was also interested. 27 These types of symbols can sometimes resemble geometric objects that some witnesses associate with the writing on the K ecksburg UFO. It is much more difficult, however, to find a resemblance between them and \"hieroglyphic\" writing. With regard to point (3), anot her significant question occurs: why did the Air Force so quickly decide that ceramic, or glazed, brick, would be the best means of shielding the object? There are other more effective, though more costly means of shielding, and cost may have been a leading factor in selection of this method. But the suddenness with which the deci sion is taken to shield it at 27 For SS rune resarch, see Dusty Sklar, The Nazis and the Occult (Dorset Press, 1989), pp. 25-26, 28. 340"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Wright Patterson Field with such bricks also suggests a knowledge of and familiarity with the object, and, possibly, of its history as a Nazi secret weapons project. In any case, the swiftness of the military's reaction to assemble a r ecovery team at Kecksburg also indicates that the object had been tracked by the military for sometime as it flew over Canada a nd the eastern US. It is as if the military had been expecting it. And finally, there is yet another odd point that may connect the Keckburg Acorn to the Kammler Bell . We have alre ady seen that some \"Nazi survival myths\" have a secret German base close to the Arctic, operating at a remote locat ion in Canada near Hudson Bay. While I discount the idea, it is perhaps worth noting that the trajectory of the Kecksburg Acorn as it tracked from Canada into the US to its final crash site in Pennsylvania, woul d, if extended north into Canada, place it along a line more or less where the \"Arctic Nazi survival myth\" places the alleged secret German base.

That it was beyond their cultural terms of reference. That's why they recruited so many Germans. The Nazis developed a unique approach to science and engineering quite separate from the rest of the world, because their ideology, unrestraine d as it was, supported a wholly different way of doing things.... The trouble was, when the Ameircans took it all home with them they found out, too late, that it came infected with a virus. You take the science on, you take on aspects of the ideology, as well. 28 In any case, it seems that there are enough points of similarity between Kammler's Bell and the Keck sburg Acorn to at least raise a third alternative as an explanati on for it, in addition to the two approaches previously taken, name ly, that it was a crashed extra- terrestrial craft or probe of some sort, or a crashed Soviet Cosmos satellite.

That the Germans were much farther along in atom bomb development seems clear, even if they did not successfully test a device, as I believe they actually did. We know too certain broad outlin es of that phys ics. It was based on a dynamic conception of the aether as a topological space, having most likely cer tain inertial properties of its own. It was likewise a dynamic aether, in which particle reactions appear to have been modeled as geometries and combinations of forms of rotation. It appears, ab ove all, to have been a physics based on the pursuit of the will to power, and thus willing to entertain the most apparently unorthodox ideas - fr om the standpoint of today's \"public consumption\" phys ics - in that pursuit. This disturbing potentiality raises a more problematical aspect of what has been outlined. Almost any way one views it, it seems clear that the end of the war a nd the strange deployments on the 1 Nick Cook, The Hunt for Zero Point, pp. 203, 165, respectively. 345"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Allied and German side exhibit the characteristic s of a race against time, the Nazis trying to prolong the war by every desperate means available, and the Allies, with a lmost equal desperation, trying to bring it to a close. It also seems clear that the Allies and particularly the Americans were racing very deliberately toward targets that their intelligence, at a very high level, was guiding them to. Beyond that, the notion that th e Germans successfully exploded even a large fuel air bomb - whic h they very evid ently did - calls much into question, not only about the publicly stated origin and development of that particular piece of contemporary mass destruction hardware, but also calls into question the whole massive expenditure of billions if not trillions of dollars by both the Soviet Union and the United States on th ermonuclear weapons. A fuel air bomb is much cheaper, causes a leve l of destruction on the order of at least small atom bombs, which are considered strategic weapons of mass destruction. If the Nazis su cceeded with this device, as hey very much did, does this explain perhaps the strange accounts from the Eastern Front of some sort of weapon of mass destruction being used on the Russians? One that would drive th em, in desperation, to pass on to Berlin via some neutral channel, to cease and desist or they would begin using poison gas? The development of the fuel air bomb in some early pr ototype by the Nazis explains too another mystery, for if they did successfully develop an atom bomb - then their reasons for not us ing it have already been given: they were being developed as detonators fo r something far more destructive. In any case, the various revela tions and speculations presented make one thing abundantly clear. Ou r history began to be massively re-written even before the end of the war, and has been manipulated to an extraordinary degree sinc e then. Nowhere does this seem more in evidence than in the fact that there appears to have been a successful - albeit only prototypical - development by the Nazis of a very different type of physics, a physics that remains off the books. This to me is the most disturbing aspect of all that my own, and other's, research has uncovered, for a \"two track\" science - one developed and controlled in secret by the fe w, and for their own aggrandizement and pursuit of pow er, and the other developed in public and maintained by the same oligarchy with their power to 346"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"grant or refuse funding, and their power thereby to control journals and what types of research will be \"tolerated\" - is the utmost mockery of science. And when science is mocked, morality is mocked because truth is mocked, a nd this brings us to the third area, the most disturbing of all: politics/culture. The Will to Power was what dr ove the Nazi Regime in any endeavor it undertook, whether the conventional military operations it conducted, to the deat h camps and genocide it was preparing for the world, to the occult and esoter ic research of the Ahnenerbe and the Kammlerstab. That Will to Po wer seems evident in all aspects of the science implied by the things discussed in this book. And this compels a final observation. Many people — and I would number myself among them - view the Zero Point Energy as our best long range hope to resolve some of the more pressing environm ental and energy problems of our planet. It does hold almost lim itless promise for a whole host of new technologies, and there is e nough in the literatu re to convince me that various scientists and inventors - the ones not hobbled by academic tenure or the agenda s of grant foundations and government - are on the verge of exciting discoveries. But with that energy comes the potential for weaponization of a power and sophisticati on that we with our thermonuclear popguns can only imagine. With it comes a view of the universe subject to the Will to Power. A moral cons equence, and commitment, is implied in such a physics. It would therefore seem to imply, inevitably, precisely a \"two-tiered\" science, one for the public, and one for the initiate, when he or she is spiritually able to handle the extraordinary power it makes ava ilable to them in non-destructive ways. There is a degree of evidence that this is, in fact, what happened in ancient times, and cert ainly it seems to have happened to the Kammlerstab's work after the war. Perhaps, at least initially, its contents were so sensationa l that, for moral reasons, it was decided to keep it under wraps. But the Will to Power remains closeted within that science and the black projects it engender ed and no doub t continues to engender. 347"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"The power to tinker w ith the topological pr operties of space, and the energy resulting from it, is an absolute one.

Like so much of the \"wonder weapons\", however, its principles of operation can be interpreted along a variety of line s. However, a transl ation of the German accompanying this device yields another principle of operation: The KSK armament...is based on the Noar procedure: Around a central axis lie eight weapon-tubes bound in two tiers. With the discharge, four energy beams leave the gun sheathing with a millisecond delay between the firing of the first four tubes and the second four tubes. At target, these two energy beams are united, the effect on which is greatly increased strength .... The destructive effect on target is increased with incr eased tube length of the weapon because the beam eapon : 1. becomes stronger the longer the time in the barrel and 2. through increased graduations inside the tube, the potency can be increased.... 1 While the corroborative evidence for this weapon, if it ever existed, is scanty, the principle on which it is based - pu lses leaving the weapon at different times but arrivi ng on target at the same time - is exactly that of scalar weaponr y, which creates from two or more such pulses an interference patt ern on target, as detailed in a diagram by Lot.

It is to be noted that Bearden maintains thourho ug his numerous books that this basic priniple of so-called scal ar weaponry was first found by the Germans during the Second World War, and subsequently exploited and weaponized by the Soviet Uni on in the decades after the war. The weapon is alleged to have been employed on the German saucers. 1 Henry Stevens, Rumored German Wonder Weapons, report Four: The German Death Rays, pp. 17, 19. 349"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":" PW Intelligence Bulletin No 2/32 's Sketch of th e Ludwigshafen- Heidelberg Quartz Reflector High- Voltage Disintegration Ray Installation 351"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":" New York Times June 29, 1945 Article About Nazi Orbital Solar Mirror Weapon 352"}]
