Workof this sort does not occur in a vacuum, and can be–as I know all too well–verytime-consuming, and consequently, would not see the light of day without thegenerous support of so many good people willing to assist financially in thiseffort with their donations. Many have the opinion that authors, because theyare published, are, if not rich, at least well off. But the reality ofpublishing is that, with but rare exceptions, authors generally do not see muchreturn for their investment of time and research.

As a boy, I, like many other American boys, loved to read comic books. Butunlike the majority of my comic-book-reading colleagues, I did not spend my timewith Superman, Batman, the X-men, Tarzan, or comics of the superhero genre.Rather, I spent it with — and the reader is permitted a laugh, for I too regardit with some amusement — Disney’s Scrooge McDuck, the world’s richest duck, witha “money bin” full of three cubic acres of money, making himmore-than-fabulously wealthy.Scrooge and his nephew, Donald, and grandnephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie, wouldset off on fantastic adventures all over the world in search of this or thatfamous object or artifact. More to the point, the adventures which stimulated myimagination and thought the most were always those penned and composed by thecartoonist Carl Barks, a master storyteller. Barks was certainly familiar withthe odd niche and avenue within human history, archaeology, and esotericism. Iremember well specific comics where the Duck family would go off in search ofthe Seven Cities of Cibola, or where they would find lost Inca tribes (of ducks,naturally), living high in the Andes among ruins that, later, I would identifyas having a more than coincidental resemblance to Machu Picchu.In one of these Barks-inspired adventures, after Scrooge has assiduouslysearched through numerous self-evidently obscure and ancient texts, the intrepidducks went in search of, and actually found, the ancient alchemicalPhilosophers’ Stone, an object reputedly capable of transmuting base metals intogold. In other words, Barks merely used the Duck family characters as a templatefor his adventures, which in turn sometimes functioned merely as a means toeducate and communicate legends and myths a young boy might not otherwiseencounter in the bland and atrophied curriculum of modern American public school“education.” The concept of the Philosophers’ Stone thus lodged in my mind at avery early age, and I purposed to learn more about it and, perhaps, to write myown comic book about it some day.Well, this book is obviously not a comic book, but it is the fruit of myinterest and researches on the subject of the Philosophers’ Stone and alchemy ingeneral. And there are “synchronicities” in it that readers of my previous bookswill readily recognize. The whole theme of exotic matter or states of matter wasfirst enunciated way back in my first book on alternative science and history,The Giza Death Star, followed up in The Giza Death Star Destroyed, and pursuedin, of all places, The SS Brotherhood of the Bell: NASA’s Nazis, JFK, andMAJIC-12. The idea of a transmutative physical medium, similarly, was enunciatedin the first book and a whole chapter appendix was devoted to it in The GizaDeath Star Destroyed. The whole idea of the non-locality of the physical mediumand its strange hyper-dimensional properties, and the peculiar interplay of suchhyper-dimensional physics with human history, has been a consistent leitmotifinterwoven on many detailed levels throughout all my books.One of the themes of my book Secrets of the Unified Field: The PhiladelphiaExperiment, the Nazi Bell, and the Discarded Theory, is a major theme again inthis one: torsion. Therefore, a word is necessary on how I use this term“torsion” in the current work. Torsion, in its normal mathematical and physicsmeaning, has a very specific description and yields certain very discrete,usually very minute, values, whether one is referring to the Einstein-Cartan orthe Ricci torsion tensors. I am not using the word in this specific manner,though I certainly do not exclude these meanings, when appropriate, from myusage here. Rather, I use the word to signify the concept that torsionrepresents: the folding and pleating of space that occurs in a spiralingrotating system of space. The analogy I used to explain the concept in Secretsof the Unified Field was that of wringing an empty aluminum soda can like onewas wringing a dishrag. The analogy is applied here as well.All this being said, this book concentrates on three exotic “materials” exploredin my previous books, namely the monatomic American “Gold” of David Hudson, theballotechnic Soviet “Mercury” of the “red mercury” nuclear scare of the 1990s,and the torsion and high-spin-state Nazi “Serum” of the Nazi Bell device. Whilethe previous books did not go into great depth with their exploration of each ofthese substances, this one does so, with a view to exhibiting their commonunderlying features, and the torsion-based physics from which they are derivedand upon which they are based.Finally a word about my whole approach in this book is warranted, for in somerespects it is different than in the other books. Many “paranormal” phenomena or“esoteric arts” can be scientifically rationalized by appeals to the variousstandard models of physics. So why appeal to alchemy and less well-known, andcertainly “non-standard” theories in physics to explain it? And why write aboutthese three substances — the American “Gold,” the Soviet “Mercury,” and the Nazi“Serum” — in particular, when so much more could be said about Dark Matter, DarkEnergy, and all the wonderful scenery and special effects on the entertainingscreen of the standard models of physics?To ask these questions is to imply the answers, for so much has been writtenabout the scientific rationalizations and connections with other “esotericsubjects,” to do so again would only add to the volume of burgeoning andoftentimes mediocre literature about them. Besides, the esoteric “science” ofalchemy made certain very specific claims and assertions, as do the claims andassertions surrounding the legends of those three very alchemical modernsubstances that one will never find mentioned in that burgeoning literature andtheir tired rehearsals of the same well-known fads of popularized standard modelphysics. These substances are best rationalized by more “off the books” and lesswell-known ideas, ideas equally deserving of popular treatment. As a result ofthis approach, one implication of this study is that there would indeed seem tobe adumbrations of confirmations of ancient esoteric views of the physicalmedium, and that shadowy groups in the contemporary world are intent uponrecovering that lost science, implementing the whole range of technologies thatit implies, and monopolizing it for themselves.In recounting this story, a little-known physics theory is explored, one which,unlike the fads of modern theoretical physics, has every appearance of beingable to explain the odd behavior of these materials, and to make its ownspecific testable predictions. And interestingly enough, that theory, as weshall see, leads us once more back to Germany, and to what the Nazis mayactually have been up to. It is, as will also be seen, a hyper-dimensionalunified field theory, complete with sub-spaces, and spin orientationcharacteristics, but one which, unlike certain other splendiferous mathematicalscholasticisms within contemporary theoretical physics, has enough testablepredictive power that it can be, and has been, actually tested and to someextent verified.And that, interestingly enough, will lead us in turn, once again, to NASA, andNASA’s Nazis….

It is the last gasp of a dying, unscientific, mediaeval age thatis desperate for fresh air in an atmosphere choked with vials of vile philtersand smoggy, greasy arts and vapors.Alchemy.Only speak the word and one will make a “real” scientist distinctlyuncomfortable, perhaps even somewhat belligerent.2[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-2]For alchemy — in its quest for the Great Elixir, the Philosophers’ Stone,capable of transmuting base metals into “gold” — with its bewildering array ofcoded symbols, astrological lore, geometric diagrams and charts, is really aquest for exotic matter or exotic states of matter. In this, it is curiouslymuch like modern physics with its own bewildering array of obscure hierophantsscratching the coded symbols of higher mathematics on blackboards, working intheir own laboratories of arcane equipment, poring over their own charts ofcomputer-generated models and geometries of atoms, paying enormous sums forobscure volumes of wisdom and recipes of equations, all in aid of its own questto confect exotic matter, a dark materia prima, able to manipulate the fabric ofspace-time itself.And like alchemy, it seeks the patronage of the wealthy and caters to thepowerful, all the while speaking its own coded language, trying to keep itssecrets to itself and away from the great masses of the people.Little, if anything at all, has really changed.And in this resemblance, of course, there lies a tale, for the truth of thematter is, perhaps, that the resemblance is more than coincidental, for itconcerns more than the similarities of their accidentals, but lies chiefly inthe substance and methods of the quest itself. Why, indeed, should modernscience and ancient alchemy be after essentially the same thing? Whence, beyondthe desires of the human heart and mind itself, does this quest originate? Andmore importantly, where has it taken us thus far? The answer to these questionsis what this book, in part, is about.More particularly, this book is also about three of those modern alchemi-cal“exotic materials”: the American “Gold,” the Soviet “Mercury,” and the Nazi“Serum.” I have written briefly about each of these substances in my previousbooks,3 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-3] but in each case,only in connection to the other subjects under discussion. Here however theexploration is couched in terms of these exotic, “alchemical” materialsthemselves. As will be seen in this discussion, new details will emerge, detailsthat convey the strong impression that a very different and exotic form ofphysics exists and is being pursued, off the books, at great expense and inuttermost secrecy, in the occulted laboratories of the world’s major powers.But why call this modern quest for such materials “alchemical” at all? Whyinvoke the deliberate comparison between modern physics and mediaevalesotericism? To answer this question will require us to have a basic familiaritywith what alchemy really was and what it was really after, and not what thepopular imagination says it was and says it was after. And along the way, weshall even uncover a peculiar theological connection.A. THE ORIGINS AND HEYDAY OF ALCHEMY1. BACK TO THE ESOTERIC “GAP”: THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ALCHEMY FOR ESOTERICHISTORYTo put it succinctly, the very existence of alchemy is testament to the factthat, from the death of the last great Neoplatonist magician, Iamblichus, to therise of the Renaissance with its own strong esoteric preoccupations, there wasmore or less a continuous underground current of esoteric thought deliberatelytrying to “turn the stream” and to recover ancient lost science. Alchemy wasthought to be both the means of recovering that lost science and also theembodiment of it.But what does this mean?In the third book of my Giza Death Star trilogy, The Giza Death Star Deployed, Iwrote that there is a historical “gap” of some eight centuries’ duration betweenthe death of the last great Neoplatonic magician and practitioner of the“ancient arts,” Iamblichus, in 302 A.D. in Rome, and the rise, centuries later,of the first great occidental esoteric society, the Templars ca. 1118 A.D. Thequestion was, what happened to the esoteric and occult tradition during thatperiod? How does one “fill it in”?4[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-4] “Various theories,” I noted,May be and have been advanced to fill in this gap, with the usual contenders forcarrying on the tradition being Jewish Qabbalists in Moorish Spain, the Catharsin the Languedoc in southern France, to the more ingenious explanations of somethat the Templars, by coming into contact with Byzantine humanists, with theiraccess to the rich archives of Constantinople, or with Arab-Muslim esotericsocieties such as the Assassins, which had preserved apart from the prying eyesof Muslim “orthodoxy” the ancient mysteries.5[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-5]But this still does not satisfactorily explain the “gap,” for the gap exists noton the Spanish or Byzantine or Muslim peripheries of the Western Europeanheartland, but in that heartland itself, otherwise, the sudden reemergence ofesotericism in the royal courts of Renaissance Europe makes little sense. Soonce again the important question must be asked: Who, or what entities,preserved this tradition during the period of the “gap”?To have been able to preserve such a tradition for so long would have meant thatany entities doing so had to have had rather powerful and stable institutionalprotectors and mentors, and there are really only two places that offerthemselves for consideration in this respect, and one of them is the papal courtin the Lateran Palace itself,For one conceivable place with access to repositories of knowledge notaccessible to the general public would have been the papal court….But there was a caveat:I am not suggesting that the papal court itself was this entity, rather, thatwithin the papal court there may have existed, for some centuries following thecollapse of the Western Roman Empire, a hidden group of cardinal-deacons andother clergy, constituted of old Roman senatorial families, whose allegiance toChristianity may have been only superficial. Control of the growing papalarchives, some of which included old Roman imperial archives, would have givenaccess to the type of knowledge that guided the early Templar excavations at theTemple mount. And only the Church would have been in a position of sufficientwealth to reward the Templars for their (discoveries in Palestine) — or to paythem enough to keep quiet about it.6[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-6]It is this link to the old Roman senatorial families — who directed much of theinner machinations of Papal statecraft during the early Middle Ages — that inturn leads to the second candidate for powerful and stable patronage of theesoteric tradition during the period of the “esoteric gap,” and that entity isthe older royal and noble houses of Europe, some with ties, perhaps, to theJewish diaspora after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.7[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-7] And so I concluded that “thebest place to look to fill in the ‘gap’ between the ancient mystery schools andthe first modern esoteric schools and secret societies is either in Rome itself,or in Europe’s ancient royal houses.”8[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-8]It is alchemy itself, then, that constitutes the precise vehicle by which thepractitioners of the esoteric arts carried forward this tradition during the“esoteric gap.” They not only did so in a more or less continuous anduninterrupted stream, but, in confirmation of the thesis advanced in my GizaDeath Star Destroyed, they did so not only under the loose patronage of theChurch, but more importantly, under the direct patronage of some of the mostwell-known royal houses of Europe, as will be seen a little later on in thischapter.2. THE ORIGINS AND HEYDAY OF ALCHEMYMost scholars of alchemy are agreed that its origins lie in ancient Egypt. TheEnglish scholar E.J. Holmyard, however, expressed a more cautious outlook towardthe view that would connect the science too exclusively with Egypt itself:The word alchemy is derived from the Arabic name of the art, alkimia, in which‘al’ is the definite article. On the origin of ‘kimia’ there are differences ofopinion. Some hold that it is derived from kmt or chem, the ancient Egyptians’name for their country; this means ‘the black land,’ and is a reference to theblack alluvial soil bordering the Nile as opposed to the tawny-coloured desertsands. In the early days of alchemy it was much practised in Egypt, and if thisderivation is accepted the name would mean ‘the Egyptian art.’ Against thisetymology is the fact that in ancient texts kmt or chem is never associated withalchemy, and it is perhaps more likely that kimia comes from the Greek chyma,meaning to fuse or cast a metal.9[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-9]Thus, while the etymology of the word is suggestively obscure, there is littledoubt that the actual practice of the art is connected to Egypt in some form.This becomes more apparent as one searches for the earliest mentions of the art.And in this search for the earliest mention, another strange twist is added tothe story, for a new contender for the origin of the practice enters the scene:China.There is some doubt concerning the earliest mention of alchemy, for a referenceto it occurs in a Chinese edict of 44 B.C., while a book on alchemical matterswas written in Egypt by Bolos Democritos at a date that cannot be more preciselyfixed than about 200 B.C. However, whether the honour should go to China, orwhether Egypt established a slight lead, there is no uncertainty about the factthat the main line of development of alchemy began in Hellenistic Egypt, andparticularly Alexandria and other towns of the Nile delta.10[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-10]That both Egypt and China should record some of the earliest mentions of alchemyhighlights once again the possibility that the art may be very ancient indeed,and stem from some hitherto unknown contact between the two civilizations, oralternatively, may be the declined legacy in each case of an even older commoncivilization, of extreme antiquity, from which Egypt and China derived it.11[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-11]In any case, by the time of the famous Greek alchemist Zosimos of Panopolis, orAkhmim, in Egypt in 300 A.D. “alchemical speculation (had run) riot.”12[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-12]We now find in it a bewildering confusion of Egyptian magic, Greek philosophy,Gnosticism, Neo-Platonism, Babylonian astrology, Christian theology, and paganmythology, together with the enigmatical and allusive language that makes theinterpretation of alchemical literature so difficult and so uncertain.13[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-13]By the time of the Byzantine alchemist Stephanos of Alexandria, active duringthe reign of the Emperor Heraclius I (610–641),14[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-14] alchemy had considerablytoned down the Gnostic and Neoplatonic elements, but the situation in generalremained more or less the same as far as the confusion and ambiguity present inalchemical texts and their “technological” vocabulary were concerned.The mention of Heraclius I in this regard is significant of another thing, apoint which Holmyard neglects to mention. Heraclius, intent upon the finaldestruction of the Persian Empire, and the restoration and recovery of Egypt tothe Roman Empire, had embarked on a military and theological campaign designedto return Egypt’s Monophysite Christians and reconcile them to the EcumenicalCouncils of the Imperial Church. Theologically this effort was spearheaded byhis erudite patriarch, Sergius of Constantinople. This effort failed largelybecause, under Sergius’ tutelage, a new heresy broke out known asMonotheletism,15 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-15] but for ourpurposes the campaign indicates that Stephanos the alchemist, whose activitieswere surely known to the Emperor, was tolerated. And this implies, of course, akind of tacit royal tolerance that in practical terms fell just short ofpatronage. This connection of alchemy to royal tolerance or outright patronageis a pattern that we shall see recur over and over again.By the time of alchemy’s heyday, “from about A.D. 800 to the middle of theseventeenth century,”16 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-16] itspractitioners included everyone fromkings, popes, and emperors to minor clergy, parish clerks, smiths, dyers, andtinkers. Even such accomplished men as Roger Bacon, St Thomas Aquinas, SirThomas Browne, John Evelyn, and Sir Isaac Newton were deeply interested in it,and Charles II had an alchemical laboratory built under the royal bedchamberwith access by a private staircase. Other alchemical monarchs were Herakleios Iof Byzantium, James IV of Scotland, and the Emperor Rudolf II.17[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-17]In other words, alchemy had the patronage not only of some popes, but moreimportantly, of the powerful royal houses of Hapsburg and Stuart, whose ownconnections to Masonry and other esoteric societies and doctrines is a matter ofsome record.18 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-18]B. EXOTERIC AND ESOTERIC ALCHEMYWhat exactly is alchemy then?Most people are aware of the fact that alchemy is the “quest to make thePhilosophers’ Stone,” and most know that this in turn is a stone whichpurportedly has the power to “transmute base metals into pure gold,” eitherthrough touching them with it, or via some other operation involving it. Buthere popular knowledge usually stops and fantasy, or ignorance, begins, for allis not as simple as the popular imagination would make it out to be, for thequest for the Philosophers’ Stone really involves the whole system of alchemicalbelief regarding the properties of matter, and their derivation from the firstact of creation itself.The first thing to be noticed about alchemy is its persistent “dual” nature atalmost every level, from the ambiguity of its technical terminology to itsoverall framework involving both exoteric and esoteric pursuits. In the latterrespect, Holmyard observes thatAlchemy is of a twofold nature, an outward or exoteric and a hidden or esoteric.Exoteric alchemy is concerned with attempts to prepare a substance, thephilosophers’ stone, or simply the Stone, endowed with the power of transmutingthe base metals lead, tin, copper, iron, and mercury into the precious metalsgold and silver…. The belief that it could be obtained only by divine grace andfavour led to the development of esoteric or mystical alchemy, and thisgradually developed into a devotional system where the mundane transmutation ofmetals became merely symbolic of the transformation of sinful man into a perfectbeing through prayer and submission to the will of God. The two kinds of alchemywere often inextricably mixed; however, in some of the mystical treatises it isclear that the authors are not concerned with material substances but areemploying the language of exoteric alchemy for the sole purpose of expressingtheological, philosophical, or mystical beliefs and aspirations.19[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-19]This dual exoteric-esoteric aspect of alchemy, however, is so intricatelyintertwined that its exoteric aspect “cannot properly be appreciated if theother aspect is not always borne in mind.”20[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-20]The “dual” aspect of alchemy is replicated in its exoteric practice as well. Themediaeval alchemist Petrus Bonus, writing ca. 1330 A.D., stated thatThe principles of alchemy are twofold, natural and artificial. The naturalprinciples are the causes of the four elements, of the metals, and of all thatbelongs to them. The artificial principles are sublimation, separation,distillation, calcinations, coagulation, fixation, and creation, besides all thetests, signs, and colours by which the artificer can tell whether theseoperations have been properly performed or not.21[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-21]In other words, the operations of alchemy itself constitute the human andartificial element of exoteric alchemy. In this, one sees the connection to theesoteric, for in order to perform these operations, the alchemist himself had totransmute himself, with the aid of divine enlightenment, from the “base metal”of sinful humanity to the “pure gold” of the redeemed and enlightened soul.1. THE AMBIGUOUS NATURE OF THE TECHNICAL LANGUAGE OF ALCHEMYPetrus Bonus also notes that the dual aspect of alchemy is further mirrored inits actual technical terminology and style of diction, for everywhere one turnsin conventional alchemical texts, one is confronted by intentionally ambiguouslanguage, i.e., language that is intentionally designed to have more than onelevel of meaning. Even though the actual operations of exoteric alchemyCould be transmitted in a very short time, he goes on to explain that the searchfor that knowledge is very difficult, partly because the adepts use words notonly in their ordinary sense but in allegorical, metaphorical, enigmatical,equivocal, and even ironical ways .22[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-22]In other words, alchemy, like any other occult or esoteric art, used languagedeliberately designed both to reveal and to conceal. The result, as Holmyardobserves, “is that it is not always possible to decide whether a particularpassage refers to an actual practical experiment or is of purely esotericsignificance.”23 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-23]This ambiguity may easily be seen by a glance at a typical table ofcorrespondences between alchemical operations and the signs of the zodiac, bothof which share common symbols:Operation Zodiacal Symbol Astrological Meaning Calcination ♈ Aries, the RamCongelation ♉ Taurus, the Bull Fixation ♊ Gemini, the Twins Solution ♋ Cancer,the Crab Digestion ♌ Leo, the Lion Distillation ♍ Virgo, the Virgin Sublimation♎ Libra, the Scales Separation ♏ Scorpio, the Scorpion Ceration ♐ Sagittarius,the Archer Fermentation ♑ Capricornus, the Goat Multiplication ♒ Aquarius, theWater-Carrier Projection ♓ Pisces, the FishesTable 1: Alchemical Operations and Zodiacal Correspondences 24[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-24]There is a point in this table whose true significance will only become manifestin later chapters, namely, that alchemy associates certain of its processes andresults with the positions of celestial bodies. There are also dual uses of some symbols of the common base metals of alchemythat associate them with particular celestial bodies.Base Metal Symbol Celestial Body Gold ʘ The Sun Silver ☽ The Moon Copper ♀ VenusIron ♂ Mars Mercury ☿ Mercury Lead ♄ Saturn Tin 004[../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_004_r1.gif] JupiterTable 2: Alchemical Base Metals and Planetary Associations25[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-25]This last table highlights yet another aspect of alchemy’s dualism, and it is aconnection readers of my previous books have encountered before. In my book TheCosmic War: Interplanetary Warfare, Modern Physics, and Ancient Texts, I notedthat one aspect of the most ancient Egyptian and Sumerian astrology was itsconnection of particular planets and celestial bodies with particular crystalsand precious gems:Most modern people only encounter astrology, if they encounter it at all, in the“horoscope” page of the local newspaper, or in little booklets of sun signs inthe grocery store aisle. Because of this type of exposure, most people think ofastrology as having only to do with the subtle influences of the stars andplanets on human life. But there is most decidedly more to the ancient view, asBudge observes:“The old astrologers believed that precious and semi-precious stones werebearers of the influences of the Seven Astrological Stars or Planets. Thus theyassociated with the–“SUN, yellowish or gold-coloured stones, e.g. amber, hyacinth, topaz,chrysolite.“With the MOON, whitish stones, e.g. the diamond, crystal, opal, beryl,mother-of-pearl.“With MARS, red stones, e.g. ruby, haematite, jasper, blood-stone.“With MERCURY, stones of neutral tints, e.g., agate, carnelian, chalcedony,sardonyx.“With JUPITER, blue stones, e.g. amethyst, turquoise, sapphire, jasper, bluediamond.“With VENUS, green stones, e.g. the emerald and some kinds of sapphires.“With SATURN, black stones, e.g. jet, onyx, obsidian, diamond, and blackcoral.”26 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-26]As also noted there, while no one really knows the exact origins of astrology,it is known that it was present from the inceptions of the “sciences” of themost advanced civilizations of antiquity: Egypt and Sumer. In particular, it isfrom Sumeria that most contemporary Western astrology stems, for the Sumeriansrecorded their astronomical and astrological observations on clay tablets. Thesethey then interpreted from a magical and not astronomical point of view, andthese observations and their comments on them, and interpretations of them, haveformed the foundations of the astrology in use in the world for the last 5,000years.27 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-27]But that was not all that was claimed for astrology. Budge continues:According to ancient traditions preserved by Greek writers, the Babylonians madethese observations for some hundreds of thousands of years, and though we mustreject such fabulous statements, we are bound to believe that the period duringwhich observations of the heavens were made on the plains of Babylonia comprisedmany thousands of years. 28 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-28]There is ample evidence to suggest, however, that such views were declinedscientific legacies of a much more ancient, and much more sophisticated,civilization.29 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-29] It is thusnot outside the bounds of possibility that, indeed, Sumerian astrology hasorigins that date back “some hundreds of thousands of years.”So one is presented with an interesting picture: on the one hand, from Egypt andSumer, one encounters the association of planets and stars with certain crystalsand their color properties, that is to say, with certain electromagnetic andspectrographical properties, and on the other hand, from alchemy, one has theassociation of the same celestial bodies not only with certain types ofalchemical operations but with certain types of metals as well. And metals, aseveryone knows, have, like crystals, their own unique “lattice” properties ofmolecular bonding. In short, one has, from two distinct types of esoteric arts,the association of celestial bodies, with certain materials that in turn possesscertain lattice and spectrographical properties. This will become a crucial keyinto prying open yet another aspect of a paleoancient and very sophisticatedphysics that may once have underlay the declined astrological and alchemicallegacies of Sumer and Egypt.So why associate materials with celestial bodies to begin with? Why should theexoteric and esoteric aspects have come to be intertwined in the first place?Why is there such an association of alchemy and astrology?C. THE GOAL AND QUEST OF ALCHEMY: THE TRANSMUTATIVE MEDIUM OF THE MATERIA PRIMAThe answer to these questions lies once again in the Egyptian roots of alchemyand in what those roots in turn imply. The basic Egyptian view of creation, aspointed out by the celebrated esotericist and “alternative Egyptologist,” RenéSchwaller De Lubicz, was that all of the existing diversity of the universestemmed from one underlying “prime matter” or materia prima, an absolutelyundifferentiated substrate, an “aether” or medium which then began to undergodifferentiation. This initial process of “hyper-differentiation” of anundifferentiated medium Schwaller called the “primary scission.”30[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-30] Further differentiations arein turn performed upon these initial derivations from the medium, until at lastthe entire diversity of creation arises. While all this sounds rather fanciful,it is in fact capable of a profoundly sophisticated interpretation from thepoint of view of certain aspects of modern physics, for an absolutelyundifferentiated substrate in fact is physically non-observable; it istherefore, as far as physics is concerned, a nothing, even though it may be saidthat this materia prima has some sort of “existence.” The whole of Egyptianreligion and magical practice, then, stem from this viewpoint, for if all arisesfrom this materia prima, then everything that exists, by dint of its existence,can be described in terms of its “topological descent” from that substrate. Inshort, every existing thing is connected with every other existing thing byvirtue of its creation from the same underlying “stuff” or substrate. Thesubstrate exists in every thing, since every thing is but a particulardifferentiated manifestation of that substrate.Consequently, this underlying substrate or medium was transmutative in its verynature; it was, so to speak, a “pure potential,” capable of undergoingdifferentiation and diversification. To put it succinctly, the medium was thePhilosophers’ Stone par excellence. Moreover, since it was an undifferentiatedmedium, it was above the concepts of space and time themselves. It was, in aword, non-local. And hence one can see the connection to Egyptian sympatheticmagic and alchemical practice, for if everything is connected via this non-localmedium, then one could manipulate and influence another object (or person!) viathe medium from which they are descended. This was supposedly accomplished byreconstructing as exact an analogue of that object’s “descent” or process ofdifferentiation from the medium itself. One had, so to speak, to “back engineer”the whole process of differentiations.And with this, one perceives the connection to alchemy, to what its real goalwas, and to why it connected the exoteric and esoteric aspects of its practice,for if the exoteric operations were to work, the operator performing them hadhimself to ascend back up the path of his own differentiation and “topologicaldescent” from that medium, at least, insofar as it was possible for him to doso. The quest of alchemy, in short, was to literally embody that materia primaand its transmutative powers as fully within lower diversified matter as waspossible in the earthly Philosophers’ Stone.These views of the underlying substrate or materia prima persisted into theHellenic philosophers, and became, via Aristotle, the common currency of lateroccidental alchemy. For Aristotle,The basis of the material world was a prime or primitive matter, which had,however, only a potential existence, until impressed by ‘form.’ By form he didnot mean shape only, but all that conferred upon a body its specificproperties.31 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-31]In terms of the topological metaphor of alchemy, in other words, Aristotle’s“form” is the Egyptians’ “primary scission” with all its ensuing“differentiations.”This view of the materia prima and the topological descents and differentiationsof existing things is the real basis of the famous alchemical and esoteric axiom“as above, so below.” In fact, in the most prized and famous alchemical text,the Emerald Tablet of Thoth, this axiom of the transmutative medium found itsmost famous expression:True it is, without falsehood, certain and most true. That which is above islike to that which is below, and that which is below is like to that which isabove, to accomplish the miracles of one thing.And as all things were by the contemplation of one, so all things arose fromthis one thing by a single act of adaptation. 32[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-32]In the last sentence of the above quotation, one may see encapsulated the wholesum and substance of alchemical “physics”: the “one thing” is theundifferentiated substrate, the “arising” of all things from that substrate isthe primary scission, and the “single act of adaptation” that occurs “by thecontemplation of one” is the act of differentiation itself, brought about byIntelligence and a supreme act of will. It will be noted that the act ofdifferentiation thus also connotes placing the undifferentiated medium, which isin a state of utter equilibrium, into a more or less constant state ofnon-equilibrium or stress. This too, will become a crucial point in theremainder of this bookWith this understanding of the ancient view of the transmutative medium in hand— a view that is decidedly modern once all the residue of metaphysics is boiledout of it — one is finally in a position to assess alchemical accounts of thequest for and composition of the Philosophers’ Stone. From the act of thatinitial “differentiation” of the underlying materia prima, one ends up withthree entities: 1) the underlying medium itself, 2) the differentiated parts ofit, and 3) their common properties.33[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-33] Interestingly enough, thistripartite structure becomes one of the properties of the Philosophers’ Stoneitself, in some alchemical texts, for it is often referred to as the “tripartiteStone.” For example,According to an anonymous seventeenth-century book entitled The SophicHydrolith, the Philosophers’ Stone, or the ancient secret, incomprehensible,heavenly, blessed, and triune universal stone of the sages, is made from a kindof mineral by grinding it to powder, resolving it into its three elements, andrecombining these elements into a solid stone of the fusibility of wax.34[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-34]Note here that there are three essential operations to the successful confectionof this “triune universal stone”:1. Subjecting it to stress (“grinding it to powder”);2. Recapitulating the process of differentiation (“resolving it into its threeelements”); and3. “Reverse engineering” its original topological descent from the medium(“recombining these elements into a solid stone”).The direct connection of the Philosophers’ Stone to the underlying transmutativemateria prima is made even more apparent in the following passage from thefourteenth-century alchemist, Peter Bonus:In the first sense our Stone is the leaven of all other metals, and changes theminto its own nature — a small piece of leaven leavening a whole lump. As leaven,though of the same nature with dough, cannot raise it until, from being dough,it has received a new quality which it did not possess before, so our Stonecannot change metals until it is changed itself, and has added to it a certainvirtue which it did not possess before. It cannot change, or colour, unless ithas first itself been changed and coloured. Ordinary leaven receives itsfermenting power through the digestive virtue of gentle and hidden heat; and soour Stone is rendered capable of fermenting, converting, and altering metals bymeans of a certain digestive heat, which brings out its potential and latentproperties, seeing that without heat neither digestion nor operation ispossible.35 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-35]This is a very revealing passage, and for several reasons that will preoccupy usthroughout the remainder of this book.We have the following assertions by Bonus:1. The Philosophers’ Stone is “the leaven of all other metals,” in other words,the “leaven” metaphor is employed to denote the fact that in some sense thePhilosophers’ Stone partakes of the properties of the underlying transmutativemedium directly: as leaven is present throughout a whole mass of dough, so themedium is present throughout all the differentiations of created things withinit, and that are comprised of it. That medium has, so to speak, literally been“em-bodied” within the Philosophers’ Stone, a metaphor that, as we shall shortlysee, Bonus himself employs;2. The Philosophers’ Stone can effect no change or transmutation until it itselfhas undergone change and transmutation. This is most likely to be understood inconnection with the first point immediately above. But note also that theability to change is connected with color. As we shall see in the remainder ofthis chapter, and throughout the next section of the book, this reference tocolor will assume great significance as a sign of a genuinely alchemicaltransmutation, even for modern physics;3. This change in turn is accomplished by heat, for “our Stone is renderedcapable of fermenting, converting, and altering metals by means of a certaindigestive heat, which brings out its potential and latent properties.”Thus, the Philosophers’ Stone is confected by:1. Heat, or, once again, a stress, which makes it undergo a2. Change, or once again, differentiation which “Brings out its potential andlatent properties,” which are those of3. The transmutative medium itself.In other words, some of the properties of that transmutative medium areliterally “em-bodied” in the Philosophers’ Stone by dint of some processinvolving heat and color.Bonus expands on this “embodiment” metaphor by drawing an analogy to the bodyand the soul as follows:It is the body which retains the soul, and the soul can shew its power only whenit is united to the body. Therefore when the artist sees the white soul arise,he should join it to its body in the same instant, for no soul can be retainedwithout its body. This union takes place through the mediation of the spirit,for the soul cannot abide in the body except through the spirit, which givespermanence to their union, and this conjunction is the end of the work. Now, thebody is nothing new or foreign; but that which was before hidden becomesmanifest and that which was manifest becomes hidden. The body is stronger thansoul and spirit, and if they are to be retained it must be by means of the body.The body is the form, and the ferment, and the Tincture of which the sages arein search. It is white actually and red potentially; while it is white it isstill imperfect, but it is perfected when it becomes red.36[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-36]In typical fashion, Bonus both reveals, and conceals, much about thePhilosophers’ Stone in this passage.We may summarize these points in connection with the italicized portions of thequotation just cited.1. Note first of all that the Stone is now a “tincture,” implying that it is nota “stone” at all, but a liquid;2. Observe the important use made of the “body-soul” analogy to “em-body”something. In this case, it is rather clear what Bonus means: the transmutativeproperties of the medium itself are the “soul,” which requires a “body,” theStone itself, through which to work. In his own words, it is “this conjunction”that “is the end of the work” or its goal.3. Thus, the “body” or material that undergoes the change and acquires its newtransmutative properties is “nothing new or foreign,” i.e., it remains what itwas before in terms of its being a mineral. But…4. … some “hidden” properties have now become “manifest.” This cryptic remarkcan be explained by reference to the transmutative medium once again. As waspreviously mentioned, everything differentiated from that medium inevitablyretains to varying degrees the transmutative properties of that medium by virtueof their descent from it. Thus, in alchemical thinking, these properties remainlatent in any substance, particularly in its “pure” or alchemically “refined”form. Thus, the goal of the operations of exoteric alchemy is to make thesehidden and latent properties manifest; it is to sharpen or intensify the latentproperties of the transmutative medium that remain in any element. Thus, thealchemist is really seeking an altered state of ordinary matter, so that the“body” can become, in Bonus’ words, “the form, and the ferment, and the Tinctureof which the sages are in search,” that is, so that “ordinary matter” can embodythe transmutative properties of the medium itself in this world.5. And finally, we have a most important clue from Bonus: there is a distinctspectrographic sequence of colors that allows the alchemist to know when he isgetting “close”: in its manifest form it is “white actually,” and when processedthrough its final stage of refinement to bring out its latent potential, it is“red potentially.” Thus, “while it is white it is still imperfect, but it isperfected when it becomes red.”White, and red.These are the two colors that we shall see recur over and over again in partsone, two, and three of this book. They are the strongest indicators, as we shallsee, that someone, somewhere in the secret laboratories of the world’s modern“alchemical” powers, has done their homework, and that they are drawing theirinspirations from people other than just Max Planck and Albert Einstein!Thus, the whole goal of the alchemical art lay in “the general idea that thepowers of the cosmic soul must somehow be concentrated in a solid, thephilosophers’ stone or elixir, which would then be able to carry out thetransmutations that the alchemists desired.”37[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-37] It was an attempt toreconstruct, for specific cases, the descent of specific minerals from thatundifferentiated “cosmic soul” or medium as exactly as possible, in order toincorporate that “cosmic soul’s” very powers of transmutation in ordinarymatter. As Holmyard states it, “The underlying idea seems to have been thatsince the prime matter was the same in all substances, an approximation to thisprime matter should be the first quest of alchemy.”38[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-38] The ability to confect sucha “philosophical gold” would indeed give its possessors an awesome power.It is important to view this quest for the Philosophers’ Stone in a much widercontext in order to reveal its true significance. As I noted first in my bookThe Giza Death Star, and then my books The Giza Death Star Destroyed, and TheCosmic War, stones played an important if not central role in ancientmythological descriptions of an actual interplanetary war. Stones — crystals —were a central component in the awesome technologies of destruction that allowedthat war to be waged. And as I noted in The Cosmic War, these stones weredirectly tied by the texts themselves to the geometries of local celestial spaceand to the fabric of space-time, the transmutative medium, itself. After thewar, some of these stones — the infamous Sumerian “Tablets of Destinies” — weredestroyed, others were taken and used for other purposes, and a few, which couldnot be destroyed, were secreted away. 39[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-39] In this sense, one mayperhaps also view the alchemical quest as the attempt, by technological means,to reconstitute the technology represented by the lost Tablets of Destinies.But there is yet another esoteric connection to alchemy and this quest toconfect the Philosophers’ Stone, and we have already encountered it: the EmeraldTablet of Thoth, or, in his Hellenistic incarnation, Hermes Trismegistus, theThrice Great Hermes, the grand magister of alchemy, the patron of all alchemicaladepts. By its constant reference to the Emerald Tablet, alchemy itselfacknowledges that the goal of its craft is precisely the reconstitution of thisancient, lost power, the power to manipulate the transmutative medium itself.3. THE PROBLEM OF ALCHEMY’S SURVIVAL: THE TRIUNE STONE AND THE AUGUSTINIANTRINITYAs was suggested previously, alchemy was the principal mechanism by whichesoteric and occult studies survived in a continuous stream from the death ofthe last Neoplatonist magician, philosopher, and theurgist — Iamblichus — to therise of the Templars. As was also suggested, this survival in part depended uponroyal, imperial, and even occasionally Lateran patronage.But there is another mechanism at work in alchemy’s survival during this period,particularly in the Latin Christian West, and it is a rather surprising one, andto understand it, one must understand the strange and strong relationshipbetween the “triune Philosophers’ Stone” and the Christian West’s Augustinizeddoctrine of the Holy Trinity. To understand it, in other words, one must do alittle “theology.” And it may come as a surprise to many people, the doctrinewhich came to prevail in the mediaeval Latin Church was not the originalChristian doctrine of the Trinity, which survived only in the Orthodox CatholicChurches of the East. Indeed, the Eastern Orthodox Churches to this day regardthe doctrine that came to prevail throughout the West and even at Rome itself asa formal heresy of the highest order, which played no small role in the formalsevering of communion between Rome and Constantinople in 1014, and outrightmutual excommunication and schism later in 1054. While this is not theappropriate place to delve into these issues, an understanding of theresemblance of the Augustinized doctrine of the Christian West is essential tounderstand the enormity of alchemy’s view of its “triune Philosophers’ Stone.”40[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-40]The clue to deciphering this strange connection first occurred to me whentranslating the work of an eastern Patriarch of Constantinople, who, uponlearning of the exact content and nature of the formulation of Trinitariandoctrine that was increasingly accepted throughout the Christian West, wrotethat the doctrine was more appropriate to a formulation of “sensory things,” andnot as a formulation of theological doctrine. In other words, the doctrine ofthe Trinity as formulated in the Latin West was more appropriate to physics thanto theology.41 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-41] It was anecho of other comments one often finds in works of earlier Greek patristicauthors addressing similar issues.This indeed was a kind of Rosetta Stone to unlock the possible physics meaningof ancient Hermetic texts, for what this ninth-century Christian patriarch wassuggesting was something truly revolutionary: the whole philosophy ofHermeticism and Neoplatonism as outlined in so many texts was less aboutmetaphysics in the standard academic sense, and more about the physics of theunderlying medium.Intrigued with this idea, I decided to see if, in fact, certain Neoplatonic andHermetic texts could indeed be interpreted as containing nothing but an encodedphysics of the materia prima, and I devoted a whole chapter appendix to thesubject in my book The Giza Death Star Destroyed. In doing so, one particularpassage from the Hermetica becomes particularly significant to the discussionhere, and it is best to cite what I wrote in that book before exploring thealchemical connection more fully. The passage in question was about a“topological metaphor in Hermes Trismegistus’ conception of God, Space, andKosmos (Θεος, Τοµος, Κοσµος).”42[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-42] And in its own verysuggestive way, it contained its own insight on the “triune Philosophers’Stone,” by way of a peculiar metaphor of topological triangulation:A very different and in some respects more sophisticated version of the metaphorof topological non-equilibrium is found in the Hermetica of HermesTrismegistus…here an attempt will be made to render the implied topologicalmetaphor of one particular passage formally explicit. This passage is theLibellus II:1-6b, a short dialogue between Hermes and his disciple, Asclepius:“Of what magnitude then must be that Space in which the Kosmos is moved? And ofwhat nature? Must not that Space be far greater, that it may be able to containthe continuous motion of the Kosmos, and that the thing moved may not be crampedthrough want of room, and cease to move? — (Asclepius): Great indeed must bethat Space, Trismegistus. — (Hermes): And of what nature must it be, Asclepius?Must it not be of opposite nature to Kosmos? And of opposite nature to body isthe incorporeal…. Space is an object of thought, but not in the same sense thatGod is, for God is an object of thought primarily to himself, but Space is anobject of thought to us, not to itself.”43[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-43]I then commented as follows:This passage thus evidences the type of “ternary” thinking encountered inPlotinus, and a kind of metaphysical and dialectical version of topologicaltriangulation… But there is a notable distinction between Plotinus’ ternarystructure, and that of the Hermetica: whereas in Plotinus’ system the threeprincipal objects in view are the One, the Intellect, and the World Soul, herethe principal objects in view are the triad of Theos, Topos, and Kosmos (Θεος,Τοπος, Κοσµος), or God, Space,44[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-44] and Kosmos.These three–God, Space, and Kosmos–are in turn distinguished by a dialectic ofopposition based on three elemental functions, each of which implies its ownfunctional opposite:f1: self-knowledge ⇔ f1: ignorance f2: rest (στασις) ⇔ -f2: motion (κινησΙς) f3:incorporeality ⇔ f3: corporeality.So in Hermes’ version of the metaphor, the following “triangulation” occurs,with the terms “God, Space, Kosmos” becoming the names or symbols for eachvertex or region.45 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-45]I then reproduced the following diagram to exhibit the functional dialecticaloppositions of each of these three vertices:005 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_005_r1.gif]The “Triune Stone” in the Hermetica of Hermes TrismegistusI then continued my commentary as follows:This diagram is significant for a variety of reasons. For one thing,theologically informed readers will find it paralleled in the so-calledCarolingian “Trinitarian shield,” a pictogram used to describe the doctrine ofthe Trinity as it emerged in the Neoplatonically influenced AugustianianChristianity of the Mediaeval Latin Church.The “shield of the faith” I referred to looks like this:006 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_006_r1.gif]The “Shield of the Faith”: A Common Pictogram of the Western Church’sAugustinized Doctrine of the TrinityContinuing the commentary:More importantly in this context, however, the diagram illustrates how eachvertex — God, Kosmos, Space — may be described as a set of functions or theiropposites:God (Θεος) Kosmos (Κοσµος) Space ( Τοπος) { f1, f2 , f3 } {-f1, -f2 , -f3 } {-f1, f2 , f3 } f1: knowledge -f1: ignorance -f1: ignorance f2: unmoved f2: inmotion f2: unmoved f3 : incorporeal -f3 : corporeal f3 : incorporealHermes’ version of the metaphor thus lends itself quite neatly to an analysis interms of Hegelian dialectic, with Space itself forming the synthesis betweenGod, the thesis, and Kosmos, the antithesis, described in terms of the functionsf1 , f2 , f3 or their opposites. But a mere Hegelian analysis would miss thesubtlety of the metaphor.Indeed, the metaphor is almost wholly topological and physical!To see how, let us extend the formalism by dispensing with Hermes’ metaphysicaldescriptions of the functions f1, f2 , f3 and take the terms God, Kosmos, andSpace as the sigils of distinct topological regions in the neighborhood of eachvertex, and model them as empty sets. Since it is possible for combinatorialfunctions, e.g., ∪ and ∩, to be members of empty sets, then letting ∅G, ∅K, ∅Sstand for God, Kosmos, and Space respectively, one may quickly see that alatticework (may result) from entirely different sets of functional signatures,exactly as was the case in Plotinus, but via a very different route:007 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_007_r1.gif]From this the non-equilibrium, non-equivalence paradigm (of ancient textsembodying the topological metaphor) is evident, for while the sets areequipotent in that they have the same number of members, they are notfunctionally identical.46 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-46]Here it is best to pause and comment a bit further than I did in The Giza DeathStar Destroyed.Since what is being described here are three regions or what topologists wouldcall “neighborhoods,” what is actually being modeled, via this ancient metaphor,is not only a kind of “topological triangulation” but that very triangulation isbeing accomplished by functional distinctions between each region, each of whichis not only a “physical nothing” but more importantly, a differentiated nothing.The physical medium on this ancient model thus creates information,47[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-47] and in so doing, transmutesitself. This conception is the basis, of course, of alchemy.The resemblance of this Hermetic topological metaphor to the AugustinianTrinitarian shield, with its own dialectics of oppositions between the threedivine Persons, will immediately be evident, and this suggests that one of thestrongest reasons for alchemy’s survival throughout the Western Middle Ages andbeyond is that there was a fertile, widely accepted cultural matrix in which itcould thrive, for that supposedly theological doctrine, with its own roots deepin Neoplatonism, and therefore with its own deep but largely unsuspected rootsin Egyptian hermeticism, was really about physics and topology in a propersense.48 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-48]2. ALCHEMICAL REFERENCES AND ANALOGUES TO THE AUGUSTINIZED TRINITYA survey of alchemical references to the “triune Philosophers’ Stone” will onlybring the fact of the West’s widespread Neoplatonic and Augustinian culturalmatrix, and alchemy’s relationship to it, into even sharper focus. For example,the Rosarium Philosophorum (The Rosary of the Philosophers) refers to theanimal, vegetable, and mineral nature of the Philosophers’ Stone, as do manyalchemical texts.49 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-49] Moreimportantly, it cites the alchemist Arnoldus as stating “Let the Artificers ofAlchemy know this, that the forms of metals cannot be transmuted unless they bereduced to their first matter, and then they are transmuted into another formthan that which they had before.”50[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-50] Arnoldus is implyingprecisely the type of “back-engineering” of matter in its topological descentfrom the materia prima as being essential to the successful confection of thePhilosophers’ Stone.Similarly, the Rosarium Philosophorum cites an intriguing quotation of Rosinus,in which the doctrinal formularies of the Trinity are very much in evidence:We use true nature because nature does not amend nature, unless it be into hisown nature. There are three principal Stones of Philosophers. That is mineral,animal, and vegetable. A mineral Stone, a vegetable Stone, and an animal Stone,three in name but one in essence. The Spirit is double, that is, tincturing andpreparing.51 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-51]The resonance of this formulary to the standard Trinitarian doctrinal andhymnographical expression — three in persons, one in essence — is astonishing.While there is nothing peculiarly Augustinian about this formulary in and ofitself, the last sentence concerning the Spirit being “double” is stronglysuggestive of the Augustinian formulation of the Trinity, since in theAugustinian formulation the Spirit is made to take His personal origin from theFather and the Son, as the interpolated version of the Nicene creed in usethroughout Western Christianity states, and as a glance at the Trinitarianshield cited previously will disclose. Indeed, so strongly is this ideaconnected with that formulation that the Augustinian doctrine of the Trinity issometimes simply referred to as the doctrine of the “double procession” of theHoly Spirit. The alchemical reference is therefore suggestive, but hardlyconclusive.Arnoldus de Nova Villa makes yet another reference to the triune Stone inconnection with the Christian Trinity in his Cymicall Treatise:In the beginning of this labour, I’le [sic] say, that the most excellent Hermesteaches the way in plain words to rationall [sic] men, but in occult and hidspeeches to the unwise and fools. I say that the father son and holy ghost areone, and yet three, so speaking of our Stone I say three are one, and yet aredivided.52 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-52]The Trinitarian reference again is quite clear, but again, there is nothingdistinctly Augustinian about it. Arnoldus additionally makes the comment thatthe “unifying substance” of the triune Stone is Mercury, for “out of Mercury iseverything made.”53 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-53] Thistype of reference causes many who are unfamiliar with alchemical texts tomisinterpret what is actually being said. The term “mercury” is often used intwo senses, the first in its literal prosaic sense, referring to the chemicalelement itself. The second usage, often coupled with other designators such as“Our Mercury” or “the Philosophical Mercury” in a kind of code name, simplymeans the underlying transmutative medium or materia prima itself. It is, inshort, a code name for the Philosophers’ Stone itself, and for the underlyingsubstance that gives it its power.In context, then, Arnoldus’ remarks exhibit their character as disguising the“triune Stone” in the context of a strictly Augustinian formulary of theTrinity, since the unity of that Trinity is seen to lie less in the Person ofthe Father, and more in the impersonal unity of the circle of the divinesubstance in the middle of the pictogram. Arnoldus is saying much the samething. The union of the triune Stone in its animal, vegetable, and mineralparts, is the “philosophical Mercury,” the materia prima itself: “the Mercury ofthe sages,” he says, “is not that common Mercury, call’d by the Philosophersprima materia.”54 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-54] Theconnection may easily be seen by reproducing the Trinitarian shield andsubstituting alchemical references for the Trinitarian ones:008 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_008_r1.gif]The “Alchemical Augustine”: Augustinian Trinitarian Shield with The Triune StoneIn the Vertices, and The Philosophical Mercury or Materia Prima As the UnifyingSubstanceIn other words Arnoldus, if one closely scrutinizes his remarks, reproduces the“topological triangulation” we discovered in the much earlier Hermetic texts.The transmutative medium and materia prima itself receives its own biblicaltreatment at the hands of some alchemists. For example, Simon Forman interpretsthe initial creation account of Genesis 1 as an alchemical work, with theprimordial waters representing the undifferentiated medium:Into the darkness then did descend the spirit of God, Upon the watery chaos,whereon he made his abode. Which darkness then was on the face of the deep, Inwhich rested the Chaos, and in it all things asleep. Rude, unformed, withoutshape, form or any good, Out of which God created all things as it stood…. Thenout of this Chaos, the four elements were made… The quintessence (that some menit call) Was taken out of the Chaos before the four elements all.55[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-55]Chaos is the “physical nothing” out of which God fashioned, by differentiatingwithin it, the things of the world. Note also that term “quintessence,” for itwill become quite important to the case in part three that alchemy may haveformed some of the conceptual basis behind one of physics’ most brilliant, andmost unknown, thinkers. Forman expands on what the “quintessence” is in thefollowing manner:And into every specific thing do put quintessence, To reap such seed thereof; asmen do sow, But of themselves. As they are simple and pure in kind.56[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-56]To put it succinctly, “quintessence” is yet another code name for thePhilosopher’s Stone itself, and for the alchemical operation of “embodying” itin a natural substance in order to utilize its powers. This, too, as will beseen much later in part three, is yet another suggestive link to thebreathtaking thought of a modern physicist.A. PHILIPPUS THEOPHRASTUS AREOLAS BOMBASTUS VON HOHENHEIM, A.K.A. PARACELSUSNo survey of alchemy in general nor of alchemy’s peculiar relationship to theAugustinized formulation of the Trinity in the Christian West would be completewithout noting the many statements made in its regard by perhaps the most famousand controversial of the late Mediaeval and early Renaissance alchemists,Philippus Theophrastus Areolus Bombastus von Hohenheim, better known asParacelsus (1493–1541). One gets some measure of the man in the fact that he wasborn simply “Philippus von Hohenheim” but later took on all the other nameshimself. Widely noted in his day as an extraordinary physician and alchemist,much of his written output does in fact concern alchemy, and his owndisagreements with other practitioners of the craft, no matter how ancient orvenerable:From the middle of this age the Monarchy of all the Arts has been at lengthderived and conferred on me, Theophrastus Paracelsus, prince of Philosophy andof Medicine. For this purpose I have been chosen by God to extinguish and blotout all the phantasies of elaborate words, be they the words of Aristotle,Galen, Avicenna, Mesva, or the dogmas of any among their followers. 57[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-57]Paracelsus was anything but modest. To drive his point home, he points adefinite finger to those whom he regards as the principal corruptors of theancient craft, and they are the two patrons we have already encountered: “…thatsophistical science has to have its ineptitude propped up and fortified by papaland imperial privileges.”58 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-58]Briefly put, Paracelsus knew full well where the main mechanisms that accountedfor alchemy’s survival, and corruption, during the Middle Ages ultimately lied.(1) ON THE PALEOANCIENT VERY HIGH CIVILIZATION AND EGYPTPart of the uniqueness of Paracelsus is that he was quite aware, and made nosecret, of the implications of alchemy for human history and culture. In hisbook Concerning the Tincture of the Philosophers, he writes that “I haveproposed by means of this treatise to disclose to the ignorant andinexperienced: what good arts existed in the first age...”59[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-59] That Paracelsus means by“first age” something predating Egypt and Sumer will be apparent in a moment.In any case it is to its possession of the secrets of alchemy that Paracelsusascribes ancient Egypt’s power: “If you do not yet understand from the aforesaidfacts, what and how great treasures these are, tell me why no prince or king wasever able to subdue the Egyptians.”60[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-60] But the alchemical scienceitself he clearly states came from Adam, whom he calls “the first inventor ofarts, because he had knowledge of all things as well after the Fall asbefore.”61 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-61] Because of thisplenitude of knowledge, Adam was also able on Paracelsus’ view to predictthe world’s destruction by water. From this cause, too, it came about that hissuccessors erected two tablets of stone, on which they engraved all natural artsin hieroglyphical (sic) characters, in order that their posterity might alsobecome acquainted with this prediction, that so it might be heeded, andprovision made in the time of danger. Subsequently, Noah found one of thesetables under Mount Araroth, after the Deluge. In this table were described thecourses of the upper firmament and of the lower globe, and also of the planets.At length this universal knowledge was divided into several parts, and lessenedin its vigour and power. By means of this separation, one man became anastronomer, another a magician, another a cabalist, and a fourth an alchemist.Abraham, that Vulcanic Tubalcain, a consummate astrologer and arithmetician,carried the Art out of the land of Canaan into Egypt, whereupon the Egyptiansrose to so great a height and dignity that this wisdom was derived from them byother nations .62 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-62]Paracelsus makes two very crucial and significant observations here, whosesubtle importance may be overlooked since they are so apparently obvious, butonly apparently:1. That alchemy itself is only a fragment of a once larger, highly unified bodyof knowledge and science that also encompassed astronomy and, for want of abetter word, “metaphysics,” or, to put it differently, hyper-dimensionalphysics, a physics beyond (meta, from the Greek µετα, meaning “beyond”) theordinary physical and natural world (physics, from the Greek φυσις, meaning“nature” or, in this case, the natural world). In other words, Paracelsus viewsthe Deluge itself as yet another “Tower of Babel Moment” in which an ancienthighly unified scientificreligio-philosophical world-view was further fragmentedin what could be taken as a classical guerrilla warfare operation, just like theTower of Babel: massive interference with an enemy’s communications and scienceand decision-making processes.63[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-63] Paracelsus is, in otherwords, thoroughly familiar with the esoteric traditions on this point, and moreaware than most of their massive implications, for he states them clearly: priorto the high civilizations of classical antiquity — Egypt and Sumer — there wassomething even higher and much more sophisticated. A little later on Paracelsuseven elaborates this concept a bit more fully, attributing the fragmentation ofknowledge to the political fragmentation that occurred after the Deluge: “When ason of Noah possessed the third part of the world after the Flood, this Artbroke into Chaldaea and Persia, and thence spread into Egypt.”64[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-64]2. That Egypt gains its knowledge from Sumer, that is, that there is arelationship between the two to that paleoancient Very High Civilization.Paracelsus, of course, disguises this relationship by a “biblical” reference toAbraham and his journey from Ur in Sumer to Canaan, and thence, via hisdescendants, into Egypt. But of course, the biblical reference is a merepietism, for Paracelsus cannot have missed the fact that Egypt was already thereby the time of their arrival, and cannot have missed the significance of Moses’growth in the Egyptian royal court. As indicated above, Paracelsus reallyattributes the further fragmentation of knowledge to the post-flood politicalfragmentation of the world. He is suggesting, in other words, that thefragmentation of knowledge is threefold: the Chaldaeans (Sumerians) preservingthe predominantly astrological and astronomical component, the Hebrewspreserving the predominantly Cabalistic component, and the Egyptians preservingthe alchemical component. Thus, the “triune Stone” is also a triune Stone of alost science, fragmented into three scientific and political cultures of theancient classical world.Consequently, Paracelsus uses the alchemical symbol of the “triune Stone” as asigil of his entire philosophy of a hidden history of science and a paleoancientVery High Civilization predating Egypt and Sumer.(2) ON THE RELATION BETWEEN ASTRONOMY AND ALCHEMYWith Paracelsus’ views on ancient history and science in hand, one may morereadily appreciate why he not only insists that there are many valid methods toachieving the alchemical goal,65[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-65] but also why he insists upon“the agreement of Astronomy and Alchemy.”66[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-66] Indeed, Paracelsus was tonote — with some frustration — that his many attempts to perform the sameexperiment were sometimes successful, and sometimes not, depending upon theseason or other temporal factors. Bear this point in mind, for it will becomeextraordinarily crucial in part two, for he anticipated, by no less than fourcenturies, similar observations made meticulously over several years and inseveral ways, by a brilliant Russian physicist.(3) CRYSTALS AND METALS: SAPPHIRES AND MERCURYSo precisely does Paracelsus echo some ancient views of space — and anticipatesome very modern ones — that some of his words will seem, from any standpoint,ancient or modern, rather breathtaking:To conjure is nothing else than to observe anything rightly, to know and tounderstand what it is. The crystal is a figure of the air. Whatever appears inthe air, movable or immovable, the same appears also in the speculum or crystalas a wave. For the air, the water, and the crystal, so far as vision isconcerned are one, like a mirror in which an inverted copy of an object isseen.67 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-67]At first reading it would appear that Paracelsus is talking about nothing morethan eyeglasses and mirrors, and indeed, on one level, he is. Moreover, he isadvancing a wave theory of light that at that time is beginning to become partof optical study.But such a prosaic reading would miss the true significance of his observations,for “air” oftentimes functions, particularly in alchemical literature, as yetanother code name for “space” itself, and sometimes even for the materia prima.Consequently, his association of crystals with their implied latticework to air,that is to space itself, implies a very modern, and indeed topological, view ofspace being advanced by some modern physicists and topologists.68[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-68] Given his familiarity withbiblical texts, and his penchant for interpreting them as referring to a lostpaleophysics, Paracelsus could hardly have been oblivious to the biblicalreference in Ezekiel which seems to refer to space itself as a crystal, as alattice structure: “And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of theliving creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth overtheir heads above.”69 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-69]Paracelsus also, somewhat unusually, couples the idea of crystals and gemstoneswith metals.70 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-70] Metals, likethe more familiar gemstones and crystals, also possess a regular latticestructure, so once again, Paracelsus’ views are, in their own way, very advancedfor the day. Most importantly, in yet another rather obscure work, the DeElemente Aquae, Paracelsus states that “in the matter of body and colour theSapphire is generated from Mercury (the prime principle).”71[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-71] This mention of Sapphire inconnection with the philosophical Mercury or materia prima is not without itsown contemporary significance, for the former Soviet Union undertook experimentsto measure minute fluctuations of the Earth’s gravitational acceleration bymeans of a large artificial sapphire.72[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-72]By associating crystals with the Philosophical Mercury and the materia prima andimplying that alchemy and the Philosophers’ Stone is a technology with the powerto manipulate the latter, Paracelsus is also implying that the lattice structureof crystals and of space itself is intimately related to physical forces.So what do we have?Paracelsus has outlined the following revolutionary ideas:1. That an ancient and highly unified science was fragmented by various means,including political, as a consequence of the Deluge which he interprets as yetanother “Tower of Babel Moment,” and that these fragmentations went, in theirastrological-astronomical, cabalistic, and alchemical components to Sumer, theHebrews, and Egypt, respectively;2. That some alchemical operations are successfully performed only at certaintimes and seasons, anticipating by some four centuries the views that will bemore fully explored in a modern physics context in part two;3. That there is an intimate relationship between the lattice structure ofcrystals and metals and the primary transmutative medium itself, implying thatlattice structures and physical forces are intimately connected, a very modernidea more fully explored in a modern physics connection in part three; and,4. That there is a metaphysical, or to put it into modern terms, ahyper-dimensional physics component always at work throughout all of the above.But there’s more, and in uncovering it, we once again see the profoundrelationship between the Augustinized formulary of the Trinity, its deep andunsuspected roots in ancient Hermeticism (and therefore in an ancientpaleophysics), the textual metaphors of topological triangulation in ancientHermetic texts, and the triune Philosophers’ Stone.(4) AND THE AUGUSTINIZED TRINITY AND ALCHEMYThe connection begins with Paracelsus’ statement that he “will teach you thetincture, the Arcanum 1, the quintessence, wherein lie hid the foundations ofall mysteries and of all works.”73[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-73] Again, file that referenceto “quintessence” in the back of your mind, for it will play a significant rolein deciphering the possible influences at work in the thinking of a brilliantmodern theoretical physicist in part three. According to Paracelsus, this arcaneoperation is to be accomplished by means of the Holy Spirit. But once one delvesinto what he says about this Holy Spirit, one perceives the connection:This is the Spirit of Truth, which the world cannot comprehend without theinterposition of the Holy Ghost, or without the instruction of those who knowit. The same is of a mysterious nature, wondrous strength, boundless power. TheSaints, from the beginning of the world, have desired to behold its face. ByAvicenna this Spirit is named The Soul of the World. For, as the Soul moves inall the limbs of the body, so also does this Spirit move all bodies. And as theSoul is in all the limbs of the Body, so also is this Spirit in all elementarycreated things.74 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-74]The reference to the Holy Spirit as an It rather than a fully fledged Person, aHim, is one of those consequences of the Augustinized Trinitarian formulary thatbegan to influence Western Christian piety during the Middle Ages and down toour own day.75 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-75]But the real clue lies in the identification of the Holy Spirit of Christiandoctrine with the World Soul of Neoplatonism, for in the latter conception, thisWorld Soul is made to take its origin from the Intellect, which in turn takesits origin from the One. The World Soul is thus caused by two classes of causes,the Uncaused Cause (the One), and the Caused Cause (the Intellect), much likethe Holy Spirit, on the Augustinian formulation, takes His origin from anUncaused Cause (the Father) and a caused cause (the Son). And note, in theParacelsan version, it is this World Soul-Holy Spirit that is essential to apurely physical alchemical work. In other words, in Paracelsus’ hands theAugustinized Trinity, which began as was seen in a purely physical andtopological metaphor in the Hermetica, and after its peregrinations throughoutthe Western Middle Ages as a theological doctrine and even as a dialecticalinterpretation of history itself, ends once again by being reduced back into apurely physics-related phenomenon. No better words can summarize this historicalprocess than the words of Thomas Aquinas himself on the doctrine of the HolySpirit’s double procession within the Western Trinitarian doctrine, for in thehands of Paracelsus, the historical “cycle has concluded when it returns to thevery same substance from which the proceeding began,”76[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-76]This is made more apparent in the following passage: “Eye hath not seen,” saysthe alchemical author of the Apocalypse of Hermes, “nor hath ear heard, nor haththe heart of man understood what Heaven hath naturally incorporated with thisSpirit.”77 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-77] In other words,once reduced to an It, the “Spirit” becomes merely the sigil for thePhilosophers’ Stone itself, and its embodiment into physical matter, into theStone, which has both physical and metaphysical or hyper-dimensional components.One can see the logic of Paracelsus (and other Western Christian alchemists) atwork, for the alchemical work of confecting the Philosophers’ Stone by embodying“the Spirit” into matter is the alchemical analogue to the Incarnation, wherethe Son becomes incarnate. The Son becomes human, the Spirit becomes the matterof the Stone.78 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-78]Thus, since this “Spirit”-as-transmutative physical medium is the quintessenceof the Philosophers’ Stone, the Stone in turn confers not only longevity andeven a kind of immortality, but it is also indestructible. 79[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-79]That Paracelsus seems to be quite knowledgeable of the ultimately Hermetic rootsof the Augustinized Trinitarian formulary is made abundantly clear in The Auroraof the Philosophers:Magic, it is true, had its origin in the Divine Ternary and arose from theTrinity of God. For God marked all His creatures with this Ternary and engravedits hieroglyph on them with His own finger. Nothing in the nature of things canbe assigned or produced that lacks this magistery of the Divine Ternary, or thatdoes not even ocularly prove it. The creature teaches us to understand and seethe Creator Himself, as St. Paul testifies to the Romans.80[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-80] This covenant of the DivineTernary, diffused throughout the whole substance of things, is indissoluble. Bythis, also, we have the secrets of all Nature from the four elements. For theTernary, with the magical Quaternary, produces a perfect Septenary, endowed withmany arcane and demonstrated by things which are known.81[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-81]Even the reference to the “divine quaternary” has its echo in the AugustinizedTrinitarian formulation, for in the Trinitarian shield, one counts not three,but four circles, with the center circle representing the undifferentiatedmedium, the absolute simplicity, of the divine essence itself, which in thehands of the alchemists, has become a symbol of the Philosophical Mercury, themateria prima itself.The previous reference to Neoplatonism’s World Soul recalls yet anotherNeoplatonic theme that enters heavily into alchemical texts, and Paracelsus inparticular. This is the doctrine that as all things come from the One, a processcalled emanation (προοδος in the Greek), so everything returns to It(περιαγωγη). The alchemical text, The Aurora of the Philosophers, havingoutlined the derivation of all from the Divine Ternary, thus reverses theprocess:Here also it refers to the virtues and operations of all creatures, and to theiruse, since they are stamped and marked with their arcane, signs, characters, andfigures, so that there is left in them scarcely the smallest occult point whichis not made clear on examination. Then when the Quaternary and the Ternary mountto the Denary is accomplished their retrogression or reduction to unity.82[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-82]But note that the Neoplatonic metaphor of return occurs in an alchemicalcontext. In other words, the conception of return is itself in turn a metaphorfor the alchemical operation of confecting the Philosophers’ Stone, forback-engineering the “topological descent” from the primary physical medium.Paracelsus has seen through all the centuries’ misunderstandings of suchmetaphysical texts, and their misunderstanding precisely as “philosophical”texts, to the underlying metaphor of a hidden and occulted physics. If thisseems a constrained reading of the passage, he himself makes it abundantly cleara little further on:The Magi in their wisdom asserted that all creatures might be brought to oneunified substance…by many industrious and prolonged preparations, exalted andraised up above the range of vegetable substances into mineral, above mineralinto metallic, and above perfect metallic substances into a perpetual and divineQuintessence.83 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-83]Thus, as “emanation” functions as a metaphor for the differentiation of themateria prima giving rise to and accounting for the diversity of creatures, so“return” functions, for the alchemist “in the know,” as a metaphor for theprocess of “back-engineering” that topological descent in order to confect andembody the medium more immediately itself in a creature, in the Philosophers’Stone.Whatever else must be said of Paracelsus, one thing perhaps goes frequentlyunnoticed. If the old Mediaeval adage be true that “philosophy is the handmaidenof theology,” then Paracelsus has seen through the Augustinized Trinitarianformulary to its ultimately Hermetic roots, and alchemically reduced it onceagain to its original basis in physics and “sensory things” shorn of thetheological associations it subsequently came to hold. With that, he hasperformed the irrevocable divorce of theology and philosophy as it obtained inthe Christian West.B. THE ULTIMATE REDUCTIO AND THE CLINCHERIf all this is not enough to convince the most resistant skeptic, there is analchemical text where the identification of the Christian Trinity, in itsAugustinzed form, with the topological metaphor of the Hermetica of HermesTrismegistus is clearly made, and the reduction to physics is accomplished in nouncertain terms. This is a small manuscript entitled simply “Place in Space, theResidence of Motion.” The subtitle of this is even more provocative: “The SecretMystery of Nature’s progress, being an Elucidation of the Blessed Trinity,Father — Son — and Holy Ghost. Space — Place — and Motion.”84[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-84] Notably, the same sort offunctional sets of dialectical oppositions are used to distinguish each vertexas were previously shown in the citations from the Libellus II of the Hermeticaof Hermes Trismegistus:Space, Place, Father & Son are inseparable fixed & immoveable. Motion ye HolyGhost is that which brings all things to the Blessed determination of the Dei,as in the Floria Patri, Filii & Spiriti Sancti [sic], etc.85[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-85]In other words, the Spirit is distinguished by functional opposition — motion —from the Father and the Son, each of whom are symbols of Space and Place. Thereduction to physics is once again in evidence.But there is yet more to the mystery of alchemy…"},{"pageContent":"2THE INDESTRUCTIBLE STONETHE PERSISTENCE OF ALCHEMY AND THE POWERS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS’ STONE009 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_009_r1.jpg]“No fire or other element can destroy it.

STORIES OF ALCHEMICAL SUCCESSThe persisting mystery of alchemy is precisely its persistence. That is, if thepossession of the tremendous powers of the Philosophers’ Stone was the goal ofalchemy, why then did no one notice, over the several centuries if not thousandsof years of its practice, that no one ever actually did it? How does one accountfor the persistence of the practice in the face of, presumably, the centuries’accumulated mountain of failures? Ancient and mediaeval man was no less rationalthan modern man, and repeated failures would, eventually, have led rationalpeople to abandon the whole enterprise as a futility. How does one account forthe persistence of alchemy through the centuries when faced with the enormity,and the likely futility, of its quest to confect the Philosophers’ Stone?Should not the whole enterprise have been abandoned much sooner than actuallywas the case? One possibility of explaining this persistence is, of course, thatthe extremity of the power of the Stone itself was a sufficient motivation tocontinue pursuing it in spite of the presumably large amount of data that saidit could not be done.But there is another possibility, before which one hesitates, given our inbredmodern skepticism concerning all that is “extraordinary.” That possibility isthat, on occasion, for whatever reason, there were some successes, that theyactually did it. In fact, this is what is actually claimed in the historicalrecord, if one reads such accounts at face value. Only a few of the manyexamples that Holmyard cites in his book are reproduced here.1. THE SWEDISH GENERALAn intriguing story comes out of eighteenth-century Sweden, when theScandinavian kingdom was at the height of her power. In 1705 the Swedish generalPaykhullhad been convicted of treason and sentenced to death. In an attempt to avertthis punishment, he offered the king, Charles XII, a million crowns of goldannually, saying that he could make it alchemically; he claimed to have receivedthe secret from a Polish officer named Lubinski, who had himself obtained itfrom a Corinthian priest. Charles accepted the offer, and a preliminary test wasarranged under the supervision of a British officer, General Hamilton of theRoyal Artillery, as an independent observer. All the materials were preparedwith great care, in order to prevent the possibility of fraud, then Paykhulladded his elixir and a little lead, and a mass of gold resulted which was coinedinto 147 ducats. A medal struck at the same time bore the inscription (in Latinas usual): ‘O.A. von Paykhull cast this gold by chemical art in Stockholm,1706.”87 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-87]One has difficulty imagining any alchemical process as being successful. Butequally, one has difficulty imagining any king, especially King Charles XII, anda British artillery general, being taken in by a charlatan, especially when thecharlatan is on trial for his life, and when Charles XII had potential riches togain. The Swedish royal courtesans and ministers would have literally hoveredover General von Paykhull, scrutinizing his every move.2. A PROVINCIAL FRENCHMANAnother interesting story is mentioned by Holmyard, this time from provincialFrance, and again, from the early eighteenth century. On this occasionAn ignorant Provencal rustic named Delisle caused a sensation by claiming, withapparent good reason, that he could transform iron and steel into gold. The newscame to the ears of the Bishop of Senez, who after witnessing one of Delisle’sexperiments wrote to the Minister of State and Comptroller-General of theTreasury in Paris that he could not resist the evidence of his senses. In 1710Delisle was summoned to Lyons, where, in the presence of the Master of the LyonsMint, he made much show of distilling some unknown yellow liquid. He thenprojected two drops of the liquid upon three ounces of pistol bullets fused withsaltpeter and alum, and poured the molten mass out on to a piece of iron armour,where it appeared as pure gold, withstanding all tests. The gold thus obtainedwas coined by the Master of the Mint into medals inscribed Aurum arte Factum,‘Gold made by Art,’ and these were deposited in the museum at Versailles. OfDelisle’s subsequent life, history has nothing to relate.88[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-88]Again, we find the association with a Royal government, this time that ofFrance, and in connection with its Treasury and Royal Mint. And again, reasonpauses to make us hesitate over the alleged success. But similarly, reason alsoforces one to consider that the possibility of a fraud being perpetrated underthe watchful eyes of the Master of the Lyon mint is rather slim, especiallysince the gold that was produced was subjected to “all tests.” Was Delisle’ssuccess the reason for his subsequent disappearance? Or, conversely, did theVersailles Palace, subsequently determining that it had been defrauded,“disappear” Delisle into the bowels of the Bastille? We will never know.3. THE HAPSBURG EMPERORS FERDINAND III AND LEOPOLD IOne of the best known examples of royal or imperial patronage of alchemicalpractice was the Holy Roman Hapsburg Emperor Ferdinand III, of which no lessthan four examples are known. The first concerns an incident in 1647, when analchemical adept name J.P. Hofmann allegedly successfully performed atransmutation in the presence of Ferdinand himself in the city of Nuremberg.From this hermetic gold the emperor caused a medal of rare beauty to be struck.It bears on the obverse two shields, in one of which are eight fleursde-lys, andin the other is a crowned lion. The Latin inscriptions signify, ‘The yellowlilies lie down with the snow-white lion; thus the lion will be tamed, thus theyellow lilies will flourish; and that the metal was made by Hofmann. A furtherinscription reads Tincturae Guttae V Libram, denoting that five drops of thetincture of elixir transmuted a whole pound of the base metal. On the reverse isa central circle with Mars in it, holding the symbol ♂ in one hand and a swordin the other. Around this central circle are six smaller ones, containing thesigns of gold, silver, copper, lead, tin, and mercury, with an inscriptionclaiming that in this case the active agent in transmutation was made fromiron.89 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-89]While this is not the last time we shall encounter an alchemical connection toMars, it is important to note here that once again, the Philosophers’ Stone isnot so much an actual stone as it is an elixir or tincture, a liquid.The next year Ferdinand was at it again, this time in connection withA certain Richthausen, who claimed to have received the secret of the Art froman adept now dead, (who) performed a transmutation in the presence of theemperor and of the Count von Rutz, director of mines. All precautions againstfraud were taken, yet with one grain of the powder provided by Richthausen twoand a half pounds of mercury were changed into gold.90[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-90]Once again, the Emperor Ferdinand had a medallion struck with a value of “300ducats,” and whose Latin inscription stated that “the Divine Metamorphoses” hadbeen “exhibited at Prague, 15 January 1648, in the presence of his ImperialMajesty Ferdinand III.”91 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-91]The mysterious Richthausen was active again in 1650, for in that year Ferdinandapparently performed his own transmutation with some of the adept’s powder, andonce again struck a medallion indicating that lead had been successfullytransformed into gold.92 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-92] TheEmperor’s patronage became “official” when, following another successfultransmutation in 1658 when Richthausen gave the Elector of Mainz some of theStone, a transformation of mercury into gold occurred. In gratitude, Ferdinandraised Richthausen to the ranks of the nobility.93[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-93]Nor did the Hapsburg interest end with Ferdinand. Ferdinand’s son Leopold I wasvisited in Vienna by an Augustinian monk in 1675, where, again, a “coppervessel” was transmuted into gold, along with some tin. In commemoration of theoccasion, gold ducats were struck from the tin. The monk, Wenzel Seyler, hadaccomplished the whole operation with a powder, for on the obverse of thesecoins was a bit of poetry:Aus Wenzel Seyler’s Pulvers MachtBin ich von Zinn zu Gold Gemacht.That is, ‘By the power of Wenzel’s powder I was made into gold from tin.’ 94[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-94] Beyond the patronage and consistent interest in alchemy of the powerful vonHapsburg dynasty, what is of interest in these accounts is that the Stoneappears in two now familiar guises: as a powder, and as a liquid. As will beseen subsequently, these are important clues as to what the substance mayactually have been. What also interests us is the apparent frequency with whichFerdinand’s adept, (von) Richthausen, was supposedly able to effect thetransformation. Not just once, but no less than four times, and on one occasionwith the Emperor himself performing the operation. Again, one is confronted withtwo horns of a very significant problematic: 1) either the Emperor was anincredibly stupid man and easily duped, a very unlikely possibility since,again, Richthausen’s actions would have been carefully monitored and scrutinizedby the imperial court, or 2) they actually occurred, which is problematical forobvious reasons.B. THE ALCHEMICAL READING OF PARTICULAR TEXTSThroughout the foregoing stories of alchemical successes, we were once againconfronted with another aspect of the “dual” nature of alchemy and its ambiguousclaims and language, for at almost every turn two possible explanations — fraudor actual transmutation — presented themselves, each with its own set ofirrationalities and rationalities. Not only can we read these accounts in twoways, so could the alchemists themselves. In fact, they could read almost anytext concerning transformations in an alchemical way.1. OVID’S METAMORPHOSESWe have already repeatedly encountered numerous biblical allusions andreferences in our alchemical survey. But these are not the only kinds of textsin which alchemists were able to discover metaphors for their art.A famous case in point is the classical Roman poet Ovid, and his celebrated epicpoem The Metamorphoses. The fourteenth-century alchemist Petrus Bonus, whom wehave encountered before, “claimed that Ovid’s Metamorphoses dealt esotericallywith the philosophers’ stone, and that many other ancient poems and myths hadhidden alchemical meanings.”95[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-95] In other words, thealchemists themselves believed that ancient texts of a certain type contained ahidden and encoded physics, the hidden and encoded physics of alchemy itself,which was thus an attempt to recover a lost technology and science.2. THE NINE PHILOSOPHERS, THE ENNEADS, THE COUNCIL OF THE GODS, AND THE EGYPTIANNETERSA more complex example of the alchemical reading of ancient texts and motifsoccurs in a tenth-century Muslim alchemical text known as The Book of theControversies and Conferences of the Philosophers, compiled by the Muslimalchemist Uthman ibn Suwaid of the town of Akhimm, in other words, Panopolis inEgypt.96 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-96] In the Latinversion of this work,Nine philosophers take part in the preliminary discussion, with the namesIximidrus, Exumdrus, Anaxagoras, Pandulfus, Arisleus, Lucas, Locustor,Pitagoras, and Eximenus. ‘Anaxagoras’ and ‘Pitagoras’ seem to indicate that theremaning seven names are mistransliterations of Greek names, and by transcribingthem back into Arabic characters Plessner was able to show that the list shouldread Anaximander, Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Archelaus, Leucippus,Echpantus, Pythagoras, and Xenophanes — thus solving an age-old mystery.These nine philosophers are all pre-Socratic, and Plessner demonstrates that intheir speeches (in the work) they are reciting theories that, from classicalsources, they are known to have held. 97[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-97]But why nine philosophers?Beyond the work’s own obvious Egyptian provenance, there are deeper Egyptianesoteric connections to be considered, for one has only to recall that thefamous Neoplatonic philosopher Plotinus, regarded by many as the actual founderof the school, 98 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-98] wrote hisversion of the unfolding differentiation of creation from an underlyingundifferentiated, or “simple” (απλως) medium of The One (το εν) and The All (τοπαν) in his well-known philosophical treatise The Enneads, or quite literally,“The Nines.” And this in turn, according to many interpreters, is but a “publicpopularization” of the ancient nine primordial Egyptian neters or “gods,”99[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-99] the first ninedifferentiated entities that, in the Egyptian cosmogenesis, unfold from thefirst act of differentiation of the prime matter in the primary scission.100[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-100] In point of fact, the firstnine Egyptian neters, and indeed the whole concept of neters in the Egyptiancosmology is rather more involved than the mere translation of the term as“gods” would suggest, for as the celebrated “alternative Egyptologist” RenéSchwaller De Lubicz pointed out, the term actually implies an exact science ofthe nature of cause and effect:There exists a bond between cause and effect, and that bond is called the Neter.It is this Neter which the believer hopes to spur into action through hisappeal. Further, what this Neter represents as energetic and harmonic activityis consciously evoked by the sage. This conscious evocation must necessarily bea gesture or a word of the same nature as that of the Neter summoned, and bythat fact the evocation becomes the cause of the magical effect.101[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-101]Bear in mind this idea of an exact science of cause and effect, as “energeticand harmonic activity,” for it will assume great importance not only in oursubsequent explorations of alchemy in this chapter, but also in our examinationof the modern Russian “alchemical” work in Part Two.In any case, it is now apparent that the whole alchemical enterprise is suffusedthrough and through with connections to ancient Egyptian cosmological views,views which were operative in their understanding of sympathetic magic, and thatgave rise to the more sophisticated, “scientific,” and “technological” attemptsof alchemy to recover the science of the ability to manipulate the materiaprima.3. THE ALCHEMICAL READING OF THE EPISODE OF THE GOLDEN CALF IN THE OLD TESTAMENTBut there is one more alchemical association with, and reading of, an ancienttext that in turn has an Egyptian connection, and that, of course, is theEpisode of the Golden Calf from the Old Testament biblical book of Exodus. Ifirst mentioned this connection in my book The Giza Death Star Destroyed, and itis appropriate to recall here what I said:There are numerous biblical references to being “purified” as for example,phrases that attribute a purifying action “like a refiner’s fire” to God….Alchemical “transmutation” of lead into gold, the “Philosophers’ Stone” was alsounderstood to be a purification process for the soul. Thus, such references inthe Bible often have a clear though esoteric meaning within alchemy. But isthere any evidence to suggest that the material aspect of this transformation,the technology of transmutation itself, may once have existed?For (Sir Laurence Gardner), the answer is an unequivocal “yes,” and he points tothe Book of Exodus as his evidence. The story is familiar to most of us. InSinai, while Moses is on the Mount communing with God, Aaron melts down the goldof the Israelites and molds an idol, a “golden calf.” Upon his return from theMount, Moses became angry with this idolatrous act, and then, according toGardner, “Performs a most extraordinary transformation.”“Exodus 32:20 explains: ‘And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt itin the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and madethe children of Israel drink of it.’“In practice, this sounds rather more like a ritual than a punishment, eventhough the latter is how the story is conveyed. Aaron had previously melted thegold in the fire to mold the image, but what Moses did was plainly differentbecause firing gold produced molten gold, not powder.” 102[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-102]In the Septuagint Greek Old Testament version of the account, it is stated thatMoses “consumed the gold with fire.” This implies “A more fragmentary processthan heating and melting. The Oxford English Dictionary defines ‘to consume’ as‘to reduce to nothing or to tiny particles.’ So what is this process that,through the use of fire, can reduce gold to powder?”103[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-103] Put differently, some veryextreme heat must be applied beyond the melting temperature of gold in order forit to actually burn and be reduced to a particulate. 104[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-104]Clearly Gardner is correct, and there is more involved in Moses’ melting of theGolden Calf into a powder and consumable liquid than meets the eye of the normalpulpit exegete or standard biblical commentary, not the least of which is thefact that in order to reduce gold to a particulate would require extremities ofheat that could only be obtained by some technology. More on this point below,for as will be seen, extreme heat was precisely one of the obsessions of thealchemists.It is worth noting that according to Gardner, a third-century alchemicaltreatise entitled The Domestic Chemistry of Moses was actually the origin of themediaeval alchemical practice of referring to their craft as “theMosaicohermetic art,” and that Moses himself was considered to be an alchemistby mediaeval alchemical texts.105[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-105]Finally, a curious reference to the powdered form of the Philosophers’ Stoneoccurs in a short treatise of the mediaeval alchemist Glauber entitled “How toMake and Prepare the ‘Atoms’ of Gold,” wherein the “atoms” referred to are saidto be “most fine and subtle,” and capable of medical uses.106[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-106] This fine powder, whichGlauber does not hesitate to call “the whole secret of the thing,”107[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-107] is also of a transparentruby color.108 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-108] Bear thisfine powder in mind, for it will assume great significance in the next chapter.Yet another alchemical treatise likewise mentions the “ruby-red transparentglass” and that the production of the “calx” or powder of gold “is quiteessential to success in the prosecution of our Art.”109[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-109]C. STONE, POWDER, ELIXIR, AND THE SEQUENCE OF COLORSThus far we have encountered references to the Philosophers’ Stone being of athreefold material nature; it exists as1) a stone or mineral or metal of some sort;2) a tincture, elixir, or liquid of some sort; and,3) a powder or particulate material of some sort.Additionally, the previous biblical references indicate that4) high heat was involved in its confection;5) some sort of sequence of colors — from white to red — was the signal of asuccessful operation.More importantly, it has also been shown that6) the Stone involved a manifest “bodily” aspect, and a latent or hidden aspect,the “soul” aspect, that appeared to tie it directly to the assumed properties ofthe underlying transmutative substrate or prime matter.But, notes Holmyard, the details of such a simple outline of its propertiesare scarcely as simple as this outline would suggest. It is first necessary topurge the original material of all that is thick, nebulous, opaque, and dark init… Then the extracted body, soul, and spirit must be distilled and condensedtogether by their own proper salt, yielding an aqueous liquid with a pleasant,penetrating smell, and very volatile. This liquid is known as mercurial water orwater of the Sun. It should be divided into five portions, of which two arereserved while the other three are mixed together and added to one-twelfth theirweight of the divinely endowed body of gold. Ordinary gold is useless in thisconnexion, having been defiled by daily use.When the water and the gold have been combined in a solutory alembic they form asolid amalgam, which should be exposed to gentle heat for six or seven days.Meanwhile one of the two reserved fifths of the mercurial water is placed in anegg-shaped phial and the amalgam is added to it. Combination will slowly takeplace, and one will mingle with the other gently and imperceptibly as ice withwarm water. This union the sages have compared to the union of a bride andbridegroom. When it is complete the remaining fifth of the water is added alittle at a time, in seven instalments [sic]; the phial is then sealed, toprevent the product from evaporating or losing its odour, and maintained athatching-temperature. The adept should now be on the alert for various changes.At the end of forty days the contents of the phial will be as black as charcoal:this stage is known as the raven’s head. After seven days more, at a somewhathigher temperature, there appear granular bodies, like fishes’ eyes, then acircle round the substance, which is first reddish, then white, green, andyellow, like a peacock’s tail, a dazzling white, and finally a deep red. Thatmarks the climax, for now, under the rarefying influence of the fire, soul andspirit combine with their body to form a permanent and indissoluble Essence, anoccurrence that cannot be witnessed without admiration and awe. The revivifiedbody is quickened, perfected, and glorified, and is of a most beautiful purplecolour; its tincture has virtue to change, tinge, and cure every imperfect body.110 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-110]The process of confecting the Philosophers’ Stone is thus a rather lengthy andcomplicated one, one rather more involved than merely superheating gold. Thecomplexity of the process is disclosed by the fact that the spectrographicresponse of the material, the color sequence, is more than just a transitionfrom white to red. In fact, in this version of the sequence, one has thefollowing progression of colors:1. Black, to2. “reddish,” to3. white, to4. green, to5. yellow, to6. a dazzling white, and7. deep red, to8. “a most beautiful purple.”That this sequence is indicative of reactions of some sort — whether chemical orotherwise–cannot be doubted.A slightly different sequence is recorded by Petrus Bonus:At first, indeed, the whole mass is white because quicksilver predominates… whenit is ferment, the mass in the second stage of the magistery becomes red in thefullness of the potential sense, while in the third stage, or the second andlast decoction, the ferment is actively dominant, and the red color becomesmanifest and possesses the whole substance. Again, we say that this ferment isthat strong substance which then turns everything into its own nature. Ourferment is of the same substance as gold; gold is of quicksilver, and our designis to produce gold .111 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-111]While Bonus’ list is not nearly as detailed, nevertheless one again finds thebeginning of the sequence denoted by white, and the end by red.This basic sequence is confirmed by the alchemist Glauber in a treatise entitled“The True Tincture of Gold,” once again indicating that the Philosophers’ Stoneis as much a liquid or powder as it is an actual stone. After taking one partgold, three parts mercury, and one part of silver, and putting them into a“philosophical vessel” wherein they are dissolved, Glauber then notes the colorsequence:In the space of one-quarter of an hour these mixed metals will be radicallydissolved by the mercury, and will give a purple colour. Afterwards increase theheat gradually, and then the colour changes to a very fine green. Hereon, whentaken out, pour the “water of the dew,” to dissolve (which may be done inhalf-an-hour). Filter the solution, and abstract the water through a glassalembic in balneo, which pour out again fresh and abstract; repeat this threetimes. In the meanwhile, that greenness will be turned to blackness, like ink,stinking like a carcass, and therefore odious. It behoves sometimes to take awaythe water, re-affused and digested when the said black colour and stench willdisappear in the space of forty hours, and will give place to a pure and milkywhiteness, which appearing, remove the water by evaporation to dryness. Diversecolours now appear, and the remaining white mass is to be affused with highlyrectified spirit of wine, when the dissolved green gold will impart to it aquintessence as red as blood or ruby.112[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-112]While significantly different in some respects from other sequences, the broadsignatures remain, with purple, black, white, and red being the salient stages.Yet another treatise of Glauber notes that red is not only the signature of thefinal stage of the Stone’s confection, but that in its new, powdered state, it“admits not any more melting, nor does it of itself return into a malleablemetallic body.”113 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-113] In otherwords, at the final stage of the alchemical process, the “philosophical gold”has been so consumed and burnt that further melting simply is impossible.Finally, in what is surely one of Glauber’s most curious series of statements,the “gold calx” or powdered gold appears to be produced “by the oil of sand” ina crucible exposed to a gentle heat.114[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-114] Bear in mind thisconnection of the Philosophers’ Gold to soil, for it will become very importantin the future.The most famous of the alchemists, Nicholas Flammel, however, recorded asequence in many respects similar to the detailed sequence noted above, with butone or two significant exceptions. Holmyard summarized his efforts as follows:Although Flamel now had most of the necessary information, it took him threeyears of unremitting labour to achieve final success. The penultimate stage wasreached: all that was left to be done was to heat the product in a glass flaskof ‘philosophical egg’ set in an athanor. With beating heart, Flamel watched forthe revealing colours. They came, and in the correct sequence: from grey toblack, ‘the crow’s head,’ then from black to white, the white first appearinglike a halo around the edge of the black, and the halo then shooting out whitefilaments towards the centre, until the whole mass was of a perfect white. Thiswas the white elixir, and Flamel could wait no longer: he opened the flask, tookout the elixir, called (his wife) Pernelle, and prepared to make the trial. Thiswas on Monday, 17 January 1382. Taking about half a pound of lead, he melted itin a crucible, and to it added a little of the white elixir, whereupon the leadwas at once converted into silver, purer than the silver of mines.Sure at last that he had achieved mastery of the Art, he replaced the rest ofthe elixir in the flask and continued the heating. Now the rest of the coloursappeared one after the other: the white turned to the iridescence of thepeacock’s tail, this to yellow, the yellow to orange, the orange to purple, andfinally the purple to red — the red of the Great Elixir. 115[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-115]Here the sequence of colors is slightly different:1. Gray, to2. Black, to3. White, to4. “the iridescence of the peacock’s tail” (blue?), to5. Yellow, to6. Orange, to7. Purple, to8. Red, the “red of the Great Elixir.”Notably, it is the last two components, the red and purple (in Holmyard’s firstversion), and the purple and red (in Flammel’s), which is different, whichsuggests that the final stage was represented by a reddish-purple, or almostmaroon color.The sequence of colors is, for Flammel as for other mediaeval alchemists, theapotheosis of the Philosophers’ Stone. For Flammel, achievement of the Stonedenotes the achievement of the key to all the sciences, the materia primaitself, for it is that “first agent” of all other creations “which is the Key,opening the gates of all Sciences.”116[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-116] Yet, while in many respectsthe clearest of the alchemists, Flammel, in the midst of detailing how heachieved the confection of the Philosophers’ Stone, once again retreats intoobscurity with the following passage:I must take heed to represent or write where it is that we hide the keys whichcan open all the doors of the secrets of nature, or to open or cast up theearth, in that place contenting myself to show the things which will teach everyone to whom God shall give permission to know, what property the sign of theBalance or Libra hath, when it is enlightened by the Sun and Mercury in themonth of October.117 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-117]Flammel seems to be suggesting once again that astrology plays some crucial andsignificant role in the successful confection of the Philosophers’ Stone. To putit differently, he seems to be suggesting that celestial geometries are somehowcapable of amplifying or damping the effects necessary to achieve the Stone.The sequence of the colors red and purple is not unique to Mediaeval Latinalchemy. It occurs as well in the writings of the famous Muslim alchemist AlJabir, who ascribed the power to effect all manner of transmutations to the“grand or master elixir.”118[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-118] The Muslim alchemist Dubaiibn Malik, moreover, records the properties of this “red elixir” as being ableto effect transmutations of base metal into gold up to the amount of 500 timesits own weight.119 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-119]The Rosarium Philosophorum produces a similar color sequence. It states that theGreat Tincture “hath a clear and bright tincture in itself, white, red, pure,incombustible, stable and fixed, which neither the fire is able to change norburnt sulphurs [sic] or sharp corrosives able to corrupt.”120[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-120]D. THE CLAIMED PROPERTIES OF THE PHILOSOPHERS’ STONE1. LONGEVITY AND HEALINGIntriguingly, it is when one considers the claimed properties of thePhilosophers’ Stone or “Great Elixir” that one is confronted with even strangerclaims. Some of these have already been encountered, namely, the ability of theStone to effect “cures” or healing, recalling the biblical account of Moses’requiring the Israelites to drink the refined gold from the Golden Calf. Thisclaim is not confined solely to Occidental alchemy, for one finds similar claimsfor alchemical gold being able to prolong life in Chinese alchemy.121[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-121] The famous Chinesephilosopher Lao Tse himself composed a treatise entitled, evocatively enough,Document Concerning the Three Similars, whose central subject was “thepreparation of the ‘pill of immortality,’ which was made from gold and which isso extremely efficient that it need be only very tiny.”122[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-122] Pills, obviously, suggestonce again the other form of the Philosophers’ Stone: powder.Nor is this the only strange parallel to be found in Chinese alchemy, for theretoo the role of belief and the proper spiritual preparation of the operator wasconsidered essential to the success of the confection. The alchemist Go-Hung putit succinctly: “Disbelief brings failure.”123[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-123] Even more suggestively,however, Go-Hung states that the alchemical confection must take place “on afamous great mountain, for even a small mountain is inadequate.”124[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-124] Is this yet another versionof the association of Mountain with Planets with Pyramids, that occurs so oftenin the ancient Sumerian texts?125[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-125] It is interesting thatChina is home to some of the world’s largest earthen pyramids, and that theCommunist government of that country carefully restricts access to these sites.Another curious reference to the powdered form of the Philosophers’ Stone occursin none other than Albertus Magnus, famous teacher to his even more celebratedstudent, the mediaeval scholastic philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas.Albertus Magnus stated that he had himself “tested alchemical gold and foundthat after six or seven ignitions it was converted into powder.”126[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-126] Yet another mediaevalmonk-cum-alchemist, Roger Bacon, indicated that one goal of alchemy was “How todiscover such things as are capable of prolonging human life for much longerperiods than can be accomplished by nature.”127[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-127] Concisely put: frommediaeval China to mediaeval Europe, there is an alchemical consensus that oneeffect of the Philosophers’ Stone is not only its ability to transmute basemetals into gold, but also to effect healing and promote longevity.2. OCCUPYING NO SPACEIn this respect one of the most unusual claims about the Great Elixir was madeby the English alchemist John Dastin, a fourteenth-century alchemist in regularcontact with Pope John XXII and Cardinal Orsini, which fixes his period ofactive writing on the subject rather exactly to the years 1316–1334, the yearsof John’s pontificate, with a terminus post quem of 1342, the final year ofCardinal Orsini’s life.128 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-128]In Dastin’s writings one encounters the usual references to preparation of theelixir in a clear glass flask through which one can observe the sequence ofcolors.129 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-129] But with himthere is a new claim for the Great Elixir: even though it must be “confined insome kind of matter, for otherwise it could not be manipulated, it neverthelessoccupies no space,” 130 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-130] anidea, says Holmyard, that is echoed in the ideas of the great Renaissancealchemist Paracelsus. This claim is tantamount to stating that the Philosophers’Stone has hyper-dimensional properties, i.e., that some part of it exists in aspace of higher dimensionality, another manifestation of its non-locality again.It is not difficult to see where such an idea might have come from if onerecalls the fact that the whole preoccupation of alchemy was an attempt toembody the “soul” of the transmutative materia prima, or as much of itsproperties as possible, in the “body” of the Stone itself. It has already beensuggested that in such references that alchemy might indeed be implying a kindof hyper-dimensional component to the Philosophers’ Stone, as we have also seen,as some of Paracelsus’ comments will find breathtaking echoes in parts two andthree of the present book.3. ABILITY TO AFFECT ACTION AT A DISTANCEClosely related to this strange assertion are the claims of theseventeenth-century English alchemist Sir Kenelm Digby. Digby claimed to haveconfected a “sublime remedy” called a “Powder of Sympathy or weapon-salve,”whose secret formula he claimed he had learned from a Carmelite monk whom “hehad met in Florence in 1622.”131[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-131]This remarkable powder acted at a distance; it was not to be applied to a woundbut to a bandage stained with blood from the wound. Digby says that he firstemployed it to cure James Howell…a Welshman and a prolific author…The powder,which had a great vogue for a time, was nothing but green vitriol (ferroussulphate) but Digby claimed that a current of particles of the powder and bloodsomehow found its way to the wound and performed its cure.132[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-132]While clearly nothing more than an ordinary chemical compound, Digby’s powdergreatly impressed King James I. So, could it have been an ordinary compoundthat, subjected to alchemical processes, somehow acquired exotic properties?Digby’s own suggestion that a “current of particles” somehow found “its way tothe wound” is suggestive enough.4. INDESTRUCTIBILITY: A LINK TO THE SUMERIAN TABLETS OF DESTINIES?Since the Philosophers’ Stone is at least a partial embodiment of the materiaprima or the transmutative medium itself, and since the latter is, by alchemicallights, indestructible, very often one finds claims that the Philosophers’ Stoneitself partakes of that indestructibility. For example, in an alchemicaldictionary published in 1612, Ruland has the following curious entry about themateria prima, the Philosophers’ Stone, and its indestructibility:Materia Prima et hujus vocabula — The philosophers have so greatly admired theCreature of God which is called the Primal Matter, especially concerning itsefficacy and mystery, that they have given it many names, and almost everypossible description, for they have not known how to sufficiently praise it.1. They originally called it Microcosmos, a small world, wherein heaven, earth,fire, water, and all elements exist, also birth, sickness, death, anddissolution, the creation, resurrection, etc.2. Afterwards it was called the Philosophical Stone, because it was made of onething. Even at first it is truly a stone. Also because it is dry and hard, andcan be triturated like a stone. But it is more capable of resistance and moresolid. No fire or other element can destroy it. It is also no stone, because itis fluid, can be smelted and melted.133[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-133]The indestructibility of the Philosophers’ Stone recalls similar statements fromthe Sumerian-Babylonian epic The Exploits of Ninurta, in which an inventory ofthe stones comprising the Tablets of Destinies — over which a horrifyinglydestructive “cosmic war” was fought between factions of the Sumerian pantheon —was made. As I noted in one of my previous books, The Cosmic War, some of thesestones were deliberately destroyed, and others preserved and secreted away. Butas I also observed, there was a special class of a very few stones that couldnot be destroyed. One of them even has the suggestive name of “the Elel Stone,”and “El” of course, is the ancient Sumerian and Akkadian word root for “god.”The “Elel” stone was, like the alchemical Philosophers’ Stone, a divine stone,divine perhaps for its association with the technologies of the gods, but divinecertainly for its indestructibility.134[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-134]Yet another alchemical treatise, while not directly invoking Sumer or theTablets of Destinies, makes its own alchemical speculative interpretation of theUrim and Thummim and the stones on the breastplate of the Hebrew high priests,attributing to them an ultimate origin in whatever paleoancient Very HighCivilization that may have existed before the Deluge:That Urim and Thummim were given on the Mount cannot be proved, yet they arepotential from the Creation may appear, for they were substances whose name andessence did predicate each other, being convertible terms: the name and essenceone, the words signify Light and perfection, knowledge and holiness, alsomanifestation and truth; even as since and essence make one perfection. It islikely that they were before the Law given, for the Almighty commended Noah tomake a clear light in the Ark…135[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-135]The theme of gems or stones of power is not unique to Sumer or the Hebrews, butfinds similar echos in esoteric myths concerning the Egyptian wisdom god Thoth,whose Emerald Tablet was highly prized by alchemists as the most succinctstatement of their philosophy and art.136[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-136]E. CONCLUSIONSWhat does one make of all this? What conclusions may be drawn to guide us in thecoming pages through the labyrinth of modern science’s own alchemical quest forexotic materials able to manipulate the substrate of space-time itself?Recalling alchemy’s belief in an underlying prime matter or substrate that istransmutative, and recalling that this implies a fundamental condition ofnon-equilibrium, the following properties of the Great Elixir or thePhilosophers’ Stone have been noted:1. The Stone comes in at least two or, more especially, three “parts,” amaterial “body” and a more ethereal “soul,” implying that whatever propertieswere being observed and referred to by the alchemists, that some of themappeared to exist in a state beyond that of the three dimensions of normalmatter itself; in short, and in more modern terms, there was a hyper-dimensionalaspect to the Philosophers’ Stone, points which shall be taken up again in partstwo and three;a. This aspect is made more apparent by the later references in the Middle Agesto the Stone having at least one constituent which “occupies no space,” apeculiar quality easily explainable by reference to higher dimensions;b. In one very questionable instance, that of the Englishman Digby, it appearsto be able to effect action at a distance;2. The Stone appears to exist in at least three states:a. As a stone or mineral;b. As a reddish-purple Elixir, Tincture, or Liquid; and,c. As a powder or granular particulate;3. The successful confection of “Alchemical Gold” is signaled by a distinctiveprogression through the electromagnetic optical spectrum, with the salientpoints being a progression from white to reddish-purple, the latter of whichdenotes the acquisition of the Great Elixir;4. Throughout all versions of the confection of the Stone, an elaborate processis implied, involving the use of heat at every step, and in one case — that ofMoses and the Golden Calf — involving very intense heat able actually to consumeor burn gold itself, an observation that in turn requires a rather sophisticatedfurnace or forge technology;5. It is also claimed that the Stone, Great Tincture, or Grand Elixir is able toeffect cures, healing, and to prolong human life far beyond its naturallifespan;6. It is also claimed that the Stone is indestructible, partaking directly ofthe indestructibility of the underlying primary transmutative medium;7. In the suggestive references to be found in the Chinese alchemist Go-Hung,the “Pill of Immortality” must be fashioned on a great and famous mountain, anallusion, perhaps, to the distant connection between alchemy and pyramids;8. Throughout alchemical literature not only are certain minerals associatedwith certain celestial bodies but also the very processes of alchemicaloperations are with those bodies as well, implying that these processes arewrought most efficiently when those bodies are in certain alignments. Moreover,the association of astrology with certain gems — with crystals — also implies anassociation of lattice structures of crystals with celestial geometries, asignificant insight as we shall see in future chapters; and finally,9. As noted in the examination of Paracelsus, some alchemical experiments andoperations could only successfully be performed at specific times and seasons, apoint which will become a primary focus of part two.While all this seems, at first glance, supremely implausible, subsequentchapters will demonstrate that modern science would seem to be vindicating manyof these fundamental aspects of the alchemical art……and the parallels, as we shall see now, are far more than coincidental…"},{"pageContent":"Part TwoTHE AMERICAN “GOLD”010 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_010_r1.jpg]“Dastin seems to endow the elixir with a spiritual nature, so that although itmust be confined in some kind of matter, for otherwise it could not bemanipulated, it nevertheless occupies no space; an idea to which we find aninteresting parallel in the views of Paracelsus.” E.J.

It is also no stone, because it isfluid, can be smelted and melted….it is light and bright, indestructible, and isHeaven in operation.”Ruland, On the Materia Prima137[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-137] Arizona farmer David Hudson seems at first glance to be the least likelycandidate to become an adept of alchemy, able to synthesize the Philosophers’Stone, for by his own admission, he came from “an ultra-conservative right wingbackground” steeped in the values of famous Arizona U.S. Senator BarryGoldwater.138 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-138] And, by hisown admission, he was a very wealthy man, the materialist’s materialist:I was farming about 70 thousand acres in the Phoenix area in the Yuma Valley. Iwas a very large, materialistic person…. I had a forty man payroll every week. Ihad a four million line of credit with the bank. I was driving Mercedes-Benz’s.I had a 15,000 square foot home.139[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-139]But when Hudson decided that he was going to try to make the sodium-rich soil ofArizona suitable for growing crops, little did he know that his life was aboutto undergo a dramatic change and set him off on a quest that, by any lights,could reasonably be described as alchemical.It all happened simply enough.“You have to understand,” says Hudson, “that in agriculture in the state ofArizona we have a problem with sodium soil.” This soil is so rich in sodiumcontent that it “looks like chocolate ice cream” but is so brittle that “itcrunches when you walk on it.” Even worse for the prospective farmer, “Waterwill not penetrate this soil. Water will not leach the sodium out of theground.”140 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-140]A. ACID BATHS FOR THE SOIL AND AN EXPLOSIVE DISCOVERYAs a result of this condition, Hudson determined that the soil would have to beintensely prepared chemically in order to make it suitable for growing crops.Hudson purchased a very high concentration of sulfuric acid — 93%, compared to a40–60% concentration in normal automobile battery acid — and shipped it into hisfarm “in truck and trailer loads,” and literally injected “thirty tons to theacre into the soil.”141 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-141] Atthis point Hudson observed that when soil was subjected to this type of extremechemical treatment to prepare it for planting, that it was vital to know thechemical composition of the soil. It was while determining this that the mystery— and Hudson’s alchemical quest — began in earnest:In doing the analysis of these natural products we were coming across materialsthat no one seemed to be able to tell us what they were…. We took the materialinto chemistry and we dissolved it and got a solution that would be blood red.Yet when we precipitated this material out chemically by using a reductant ofpowdered zinc the material would come out as a black precipitant just like itwas supposed to be if it was a noble element. A noble element if you chemicallybring it out of the acid it won’t re-dissolve in the acid.142[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-142]While he did not know it at the time, Hudson had accidentally discovered two ofthe essential colors — red and black, or the “crow’s head” or “raven’s head” —that were seen in the previous chapter to be essential clues to the successfulconfection of the Philosophers’ Stone or the Great Elixir.After precipitating the unknown noble element out of the unknown substance,Hudson dried it out in the 115-degree heat and low 5% humidity of the Arizonadesert. What happened next caught Hudson completely by surprise:What happened was that after the material dried it exploded. It exploded like noexplosion I had ever seen in my life, and I’ve worked with a lot of explosivematerials. There was no explosion and there was no implosion. It was as ifsomebody had detonated about fifty thousand flash bulbs all at one time….justpoof.143 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-143]Not only had all the material itself been consumed in the “explosions,” but sohad the 144 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-144]1. SUNLIGHT AND A PENCILIntrigued by this very peculiar result, Hudson took a new, unsharpened penciland stood it on end next to another sample that was drying. Once again, thematerial “detonated,” but the pencil was not knocked over. “So this was not anexplosion and was not an implosion. It was like a tremendous release oflight.”145 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-145] Hudson admittedthe phenomenon had him “baffled.” Moreover, he also discovered that if he driedthe material out of the sunlight it would not explode. Only when dried insunlight would it “detonate.”2. REDUCTIONS, BEADS, AND ANOMALOUS SHATTERINGAfter several such anomalous “explosions,” Hudson decided to try to discoverexactly what the strange material was made of. The method he decided upon wasthat of “crucible reduction,” wherein the tested material is mixed in a heatingelement along with lead. When heated sufficiently, the lead melts, and metalsthat are heavier than lead stay toward the bottom of the molten compound, whilethose lighter float to the top and may be poured off. Normally, this will leavea small “bead” of gold and silver at the bottom of the crucible.When he had completed this process, Hudson took his bead reduction for analysis“to all the commercial laboratories” and was informed that, indeed, there wasnothing but gold and silver in it.146[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-146] There was, however, justone “small” little problem:…I could take that bead and set it on a table and hit it with a hammer and itshattered like glass. Now there is no known alloy of gold and silver that is notsoft…. So any alloy of gold and silver if that’s all that’s there is going to besoft and ductile. You can flatten it out and make a pancake out of it. Yet thismaterial shattered like glass. I said something’s going on here that we are notunderstanding. Something unusual is happening…147[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-147]While there was no way to determine at this stage if this strangely brittle goldand silver were somehow linked to the anomalous “explosions”, Hudson now hadfour mysteries on his hands: He had discovered a chemical compound that:1. “exploded” when dried in sunlight but did not do so when it was not dried init;2. would not knock over a pencil placed next to it but yet would totally consumethe material itself, and burn the pencil when it “exploded”;3. was apparently reducible to an alloy of silver and gold by normal means ofreduction; yet,4. while chemically analyzable as gold and silver alloy, nonetheless shatteredlike glass when struck by a hammer.Hudson decided that further tests of his strange silver-gold alloy were inorder.When the gold and silver were further separated out of the little beads, whatwas left was, in Hudson’s own words, “a whole bunch of black stuff.”148[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-148] Once again, the “crow” hadreared its alchemical black head, for when this new black residue was analyzedat commercial laboratories “they told me it was iron, silica, and aluminum.”149[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-149] This mystified Hudson evenmore:I said it can’t be iron, silica, and aluminum. First of all you can’t dissolveit in any acids or bases once it is totally dry. It doesn’t dissolve in fumingsulfuric acid; it doesn’t dissolve in sulfuric nitric acid; it doesn’t dissolvein hydrochloric nitric acid. Even this dissolves gold yet it won’t dissolve thisblack stuff.150 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-150]As if that were not all, the engineers in the analytical laboratories appearedto be just as baffled as Hudson. “No one could tell me what it was.”151[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-151]3. THE CORNELL LABS EPISODEHaving reached this impasse, Hudson determined that if he was ever going tosolve the mystery of the enigmatic material, he would “have to throw some money”at the problem. 152 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-152] Hiringa Ph.D. at Cornell University “who considered himself an expert on preciouselements,”153 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-153] the scientistinformed him that Cornell had a machine that could analyze the material towithin “parts per billion.”154[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-154] Unfortunately, thesophisticated machine ultimately told Hudson nothing different than thecommercial laboratories had earlier: the enigmatic material was nothing butiron, silica, and aluminum.155[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-155]Undaunted, Hudson and the scientist separated out the iron, silica, and aluminumfrom the strange black bead. When this was done, according to Hudson 98% of thesample still remained. And that sample, as Hudson put it, “was pure nothing. Isaid, ‘Look, I can hold this in my hand; I can weigh it; I can performchemistries with it.’ I said ‘That is something. I know that is something. It isnot nothing.”156 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-156]The scientist then informed Hudson that the problem was that the machine, whichused spectrographic analysis to determine the chemical composition of compounds,could not make a determination of its composition because the strange blackmaterial’s emission spectra did not agree with any of the chemical elementsprogrammed into it! 157 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-157]Hudson returned from Cornell, totally disillusioned with American academia, butmore determined than ever to find out what the substance was composed of. Atthis point, new players entered the scene…B. SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS: ENTER THE RUSSIANSReturning to Arizona, Hudson inquired in the Phoenix area for an expert inspectroscopic analysis, and eventually found a man who had been trained in thethen West Germany, and who moreover actually designed and built spectroscopicanalytical equipment.158 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-158]Hudson approached him with a copy of a book published by the Soviet Academy ofSciences, entitled The Analytical Chemistry of the Platinum Group Elements.Hudson noted that “In this book, according to the Soviets, you had to do a 300second burn on these elements to read them.”159[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-159] This posed a rather greatdifficulty for standard spectroscopic equipment. Hudson explained the difficultythis posed as follows:Now for those of you who have never done spectroscopy it involves taking acarbon electrode that is cupped at the top. You put the powder on that electrodeand you bring the other electrode down above it and you strike an arc. In aboutfifteen seconds the carbon at this high temperature burns away and theelectrode’s gone and your sample’s gone. So all the laboratories in this countryare doing fifteen second burns and giving you the results. According to theSoviet Academy of Sciences the boiling temperature of water is to the boilingtemperature of iron just like the boiling temperature of iron is to the boilingtemperature of these elements.…. So literally we had to design and build an excitation chamber where argon gascould be put around this electrode so that no oxygen or air could get into thecarbon electrode and we could burn it not for fifteen seconds but for threehundred seconds. According to the Soviet Academy of Sciences this is the lengthof time we have to burn the sample.160[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-160]Having built the needed equipment, which filled a garage,161[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-161] Hudson and his newscientist advisor performed the burn. What happened next is best told inHudson’s own words:Anyway when we ran this material during the first fifteen seconds we got iron,silica, aluminum, little traces of calcium, sodium, maybe a little titanium nowand then, and then it goes quiet and nothing reads. So at the end of fifteenseconds you are getting nothing. Twenty second, twenty five seconds, thirtyseconds, thirty five seconds, forty seconds still got nothing. Forty fiveseconds, fifty seconds, fifty five seconds, sixty seconds, sixty five secondsbut if you look in through the colored glass sitting there on the carbonelectrode is this little ball of white material .162[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-162]Note that, just as in the alchemical sequence of colors, Hudson’s black materialhas now turned white.1. THE PLATINUM GROUP METALSBut back to Hudson:At seventy seconds, exactly when the Soviet Academy of Science said it wouldread, palladium begins to read. And after the palladium platinum begins to read.And after the platinum I think it was rhodium begins to read. After rhodiumruthenium beings to read. After ruthenium then iridium begins to read and afterthe iridium osmium begins to read.However, Hudson was soon to discover something even more amazing about theplatinum group metals found in his small sample:Well, we came to find out that rhodium was selling for about three thousanddollars per ounce…. Iridium sells for about eight hundred dollars an ounce andruthenium sells for one hundred and fifty dollars an ounce.163[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-163]Then you say gee these are important materials aren’t they. They are importantmaterials because in the world the best known deposit is now being mined inSouth Africa. In this deposit you have to go a half mile into the ground andmine an 18 inch seam of this stuff. When you bring it out it contains one thirdof one ounce per ton of all the precious elements.Our analysis, which we ran for two and a half years and we checked over andover; we checked every spectral line, we checked every potential oninterference, we checked every aspect of this….When we were finished the man was able to do quantitative analysis and he said“Dave, you have six to eight ounces per ton of palladium, twelve to thirteenounces per ton of platinum, one hundred fifty ounces per ton of osmium, twohundred and fifty ounces per ton of ruthenium, six hundred ounces per ton ofiridium, and eight hundred ounces per ton of rhodium. Or a total of about 2400ounces per ton when the best known deposit in the world is one third of oneounce per ton.As you can see this work wasn’t an indicator that these elements were there;these elements were there and they were there in boucoups [sic] amounts.164[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-164]Hudson’s German-trained assistant was “so impressed that he went back to Germanyto the Institute of Spectroscopy. He was actually written up in thespectroscopic journals as having proven the existence of these elements in theSouthwestern United States in natural materials.”165[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-165] Hudson’s land was literallysitting atop one of the richest deposits of platinum group metals in the world,if not the richest! And the concentrations, moreover, were anomalously high.2. ANOMALIES IN NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSISBut the real anomalies were yet to come! Having burned the material far beyondthe normal fifteen seconds, Hudson decided to stop the burn at precisely 69seconds.I let the machine cool down and I took a pocket knife and dug that little beadout of the top of the electrode. When you shut off the arc it sort of absorbsdown into the carbon and you have to dig down into the carbon to get it out,this little bead of metal.So I sent this little bead of metal over to Harlow Laboratories in London. Theymade a precious metals analysis of this bead. I get the report back “no preciouselement detected.” Now this was one second before the palladium was supposed tostart leaving. Yet according to neutron activation, which analyzes the nucleusitself, there were no precious elements detected.166[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-166]In other words, Hudson’s special spectroscopic analyzer had returned anomalouslyhigh concentrations of platinum group metals, yet an English neutron activationanalyzer had returned absolutely nothing! Hudson drew an interesting conclusionfrom this highly contradictory set of data: “Either this material was convertedto another element or it’s in a form that we don’t understand yet.”167[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-167] This, as we shall see, wasthe key to unlock the mystery, not only of his strange material, but perhapsother anomalously behaving matter, including that of the ancient and mediaevalalchemists!A. WHITE TO RED TO RHODIUMBut Hudson’s odyssey of anomalies was still not over. One more final attempt byHudson to discover the identity of the strange material through yet anotherexpert in metallurgy failed. The metallurgist, after putting the substancethrough every known test available to him, told Hudson that the material “is notany of the other elements on the periodic table.”168[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-168]Hudson and the metallurgist decided to do one more precipitation experiment,this time with rhodium chloride. And here the alchemical connections were onceagain in evidence, for the chloride solution produced a now-familiar color:The example I use is rhodium because it has a very unique color to the chloridesolution. It is a cranberry color almost like the color of grape juice. There isno other element that produces the same color in chloride solution. When my(i.e., Hudson’s) rhodium was separated from all the other elements it producedthat color of chloride. The last procedure you do to separate the material outis to neutralize the acid solution and it precipitates out of solution as a redbrown dioxide.So we did that…Then we filtered that out. We heated it under oxygen for an hourin the tube furnace then we hydro-reduced it to this gray-white powder: exactlythe color rhodium should be as an element. Then we heated it up to 1400 degreesunder argon to anneal away the material and it turned snow white. 169[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-169]Oddly enough, in other words, Hudson’s subjection of his enigmatic matter tovarious chemical treatments and stresses produced almost the same type ofsequence of colors as that recorded in mediaeval alchemical tests: first a deepcranberry-red color, the reddish-brown, then a “gray-white powder” and finally asnow-white color.Hudson’s metallurgist, whose name was John, was equally mystified. He decided tore-insert the substance in the special furnace, and under an oxygen atmosphere,heat it, cool it down again, purge the atmosphere with inert gases, and thenheat it back up under hydrogen again. This process would reduce any oxideresidues since any oxygen left in the sample would combine with the hydrogen tocreate water, thus purifying the sample. Throughout the process, themetallurgist removed samples at each stage of the process and put samples intovials. Once the process was completed, the metallurgist put the sample intovials and sent three samples to analysis to Pacific Spectrochem, “one of thebest spectroscopic firms in the U.S.”170[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-170]When the results came back, the mystery only increased. As Hudson states:The first analysis comes back. The red-brown dioxide is iron oxide. The nextmaterial comes back: silica and aluminum. No iron present.No iron!? From the same material three different chemical results!? Was this amanifestation of the triune Stone? As Hudson quips, apparently just the act ofputting hydrogenon the iron oxide has made the iron quit being iron and now it has become silicaand aluminum….We had just made the iron turn into silica and aluminum.Indeed, they had made iron oxide turn into silica and aluminum by standardchemical practices and yet, those practices certainly would not have everpredicted such a result. Hudson continues:The snow white annealed sample was analyzed as calcium and silica. Where did thealuminum go? John said “Dave, my life was so simple before I met you.” He said,“This makes absolutely no sense at all.” He said, “what you are working with isgoing to cause them to re-write physics books, to re-write chemistry books, andcome to a complete new understanding.”171[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-171]The metallurgist presented Hudson with his bill — a whopping one hundred andthirty thousand dollars — which Hudson paid. It was then that John themetallurgist told Hudson something else…B. PLATINUM IN THE ARIZONA DESERTHudson’s metallurgist informed him that he had checked the unusual soil onHudson’s property at least fifty different ways, and the results were nothingless than supremely astonishing, for the metallurgist informed him that his soilcontained highly anomalous concentrations of the platinum group metals:“…You have,” (he told Hudson), “four to six ounces per ton of palladium, twelveto fourteen ounces per ton of platinum, a hundred fifty ounces per ton ofosmium, two hundred fifty ounces per ton of ruthenium, six hundred ounces perton of iridium…” The exact same numbers that the spectroscopist had told me werethere.172 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-172]These concentrations were so unusually high that the metallurgist demandedHudson take him to the area the samples came from, and allow him to take his ownsamples, which he did. When these samples were analyzed, they again returned thesame highly anomalous concentrations of platinum group metals.Working on this problem from 1983 until 1989, Hudson had employed “one PhDchemist, three master chemists, (and) two technicians,” all working fulltime.173[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-173] Hudson and his associatesduring this period had “learned how to buy rhodium tri-chloride from Johnson,Mathew and Ingelhardt as the metal and we learned how to break all themetal-metal bonding until it literally was a red solution but no rhodiumdetectable. And it was nothing but pure rhodium from Johnson, Mathew, andIngelhardt.”174 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-174]But what had initiated Hudson down the path of his modern alchemical quest wasnot the pure form of these elements, it was the raw soil and ore in hisfarmland. And in this too there is an alchemical parallel, for as the modern dayesotericist and scholar of all matters occult and alchemical, A.E. Waite,observed, alchemistshave always accounted the dissolution of metals as the master key to this art,and have been particular in giving directions concerning it, only keeping theirreaders in the dark as to the subject, whether ores, or factitious metals, wereto be chosen: nay, when they say most to the purpose, then they make mention ofmetals rather than the ores, with an intention to perplex those whom theythought unworthy of the art. 175[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-175]Inadvertently, Hudson had confirmed the alchemical assertions of a man writingfully a century before him!C. GENERAL ELECTRIC SEES THE EXPLOSIONS: A NEW ENERGY TECHNOLOGY?During this period, Hudson learned something that would forever change thenature of what had become for him a personal quest, and impress upon him theimportance of the phenomenon he had discovered; the American defense contractorGeneral Electric, he learned, “was building fuel cells using rhodium andiridium.”176 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-176] Hudsonarranged to meet with the General Electric researchers conducting this researchat their Waltham, Massachusetts center.To his surprise, Hudson had learned that the GE engineers had experienced thesame unusual “explosions” as well.177[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-177] Hudson arranged to sendsome of his own mysterious rhodium to the engineers for their analysis, and tosee if it would work in their fuel cells. In the meantime, GE sold its fuelcells technologies to United Technologies. As a result of this, GE’s fuel cellengineers formed their own company, and it was this company that actuallyperformed the experimentation and analysis of Hudson’s mysterious rhodium.178[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-178]Once again, the material seemed to defy all standard analysis and behavior:When our material was sent to them, the rhodium, as received, was analyzed tonot have any rhodium in it. Yet when they mounted it on carbon in their fuelcell technology and ran the fuel cell for several weeks, it worked and it didwhat only rhodium would do…After three weeks they shut the fuel cells down and they take the electrodes outand sent them back to the same place that said there was no rhodium in theoriginal sample, and now there is over 8% rhodium in the rhodium….So these (former) GE people said “Dave, if you are the first one to discoverthis, if you are the first one to explain how to make it in this form, if youare the first one to tell the world that it exists, then you can get a patent onthis.”… Then they told me that if someone else discovered it and patented it,even though I was using it every day, they could stop me from doing it.”179[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-179]And thus was born Hudson’s patent for so-called ORME, or “monatomic,” elements,which he filed for ORME gold, ORME palladium, ORME iridium, ORME ruthenium, andORME osmium. The term ORME is an acronym standing for “Orbitally RearrangedMonatomic Elements.” The reason for and meaning of this unusual title will beexplored in the next chapter. For now, there was one more highly significantanomaly, to be explored with the strange material, the most significant anomalyof them all!D. THE STUNNING MASS ANOMALYIt was while filing patents for his strange materials that Hudson noticed thisnew anomaly, the most significant of all the anomalies his strange matterexhibited.After filing his patents, Hudson was contacted by the patent office demandingmore data about the substances prior to issuing its patent. Hudson had noticedthat when the substance was reduced to its white powder state, that it hadanomalous weight gains — on the order of 20–30% — when brought into theatmosphere. While weight gains for material of this sort in atmosphere arenormal, they are not on the order of a fifth to a third of the original weightof the sample! Nonetheless, Hudson had to offer the patent office someexplanation for the anomalous gain.Deciding to use a machine called a thermo-gravimetric analyzer, Hudson begantests. The machine allowed total control of the sample in precisely controlledatmospheres that would permit oxidation, hydro-reduction, annealing, all thewhile permitting the sample to be heated and cooled in precise amounts, andweighed throughout whatever process it was being subjected to.What happened next was stunning, and it is best to let Hudson describe it in hisown words:We heated the material at one point two degrees per minute and cooled it at twodegrees per minute. What we found is when you oxidize the material it weighs102%, when you hydro-reduce it, it weighs 103%. So far so good. No problem. Butwhen it turns snow white it weighs 56%. Now that’s impossible.So when you anneal it and it turns white it only weights 56% of the beginningweight. If you put that on a silica test boat and you weigh it, it weighs 56%.If you heat it to the point that it fuses into the glass, it turns black and allthe weight returns. So the material hadn’t volatized away. It was still there;it just couldn’t be weighed any more. That’s when everybody said this just isn’tright; it can’t be.Do you know that when we heated it and cooled it and heated it and cooled it andheated it and cooled it under helium or argon that when we cooled it, it wouldweight three to four hundred percent of its beginning weight and when we heatedit, it would actually weigh less than nothing. If it wasn’t in the pan, the panwould weigh more than the pan weighs when this stuff is in it. 180[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-180]In other words, Hudson’s strange material was not only exhibiting highlyanomalous chemical behavior that defied ordinary techniques of analysis, it wasnow exhibiting highly anomalous mass properties as well, to such an extent, thatthe material seemingly could cause other materials it came into contact with tolose a percentage of their mass as well, such as the pan that held the sample!And notably, once again, the various properties the material exhibited seemed tobe signified by the color of the material — black for mass gain, fine whitepowder for anomalous mass loss — exactly as the mediaeval and ancient alchemistsalways insisted!While Hudson had not yet made the connection to alchemy, he had nonethelessdecided to get serious, and find out just exactly what was going on, and justexactly what sort of treasure trove of “gold” he held in his hands. But this newstory requires a chapter of its own."},{"pageContent":"4TRANSMUTATIONS TORSION SUPERDEFORMITIES AND THE NEW NUCLEAR PHYSICS …“The kinematic and dynamic moments of inertia of several superdeformed bands arecalculated as a function of the rotational frequency…”Y.R. Shimizu, E. Vigezzi, and R.A. Broglin181[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-181]A. GETTING SERIOUS WITH HAL PUTHOFF AND THE 44% MASS LOSS ANOMALYFaced with the strange anomaly of the loss of significant mass of the whitepowder, and the demands of the patent agency to explain the peculiar mass lossdata, Hudson sought out, and found, an explanation for the enigmatic property.The explanation came in the form of one of America’s, and indeed the world’s,most famous and capable theoretical physicists, Dr. Hal Puthoff. In his searchof the physics literature to explain the anomalous behavior of his white powder,Hudson had run across a paper that Puthoff had published in the prestigiouspeer-reviewed journal Physical Review, in March of 1989.182[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-182]In that paper Puthoff had in fact calculated what happens when superconductingmatter reacts in two rather than three dimensions. It loses four-ninths (4/9) ofits weight, leaving five-ninths (5/9) of its mass, and five-ninths is.....exactly 56% percent! Hudson had found the one physicist seemingly able toexplain why his material in white powder form only weighed 56% of its originalmass. Deciding to go meet Puthoff, Hudson took some of his material and his datato Austin, Texas, and presented Puthoff with the actual experimental data thatconfirmed his mathematical predictions.During their discussions, Puthoff told Hudson that “when this material onlyweighs 56% of its true mass, you do realize that this material is actuallybending space-time.”183 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-183]Such a material, Hudson noted, was what Puthoff “called exotic matter in hispapers.”184 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-184] Hudson had, inother words, literally stumbled across some of the exotic matter that forms somuch of the quest of modern theoretical physics — not to mention mediaevalalchemy — and it was there right beneath his feet in the soil of his farm, andit was not really all that exotic at all. It was ordinary chemical elements, butin some sort of state not hitherto known.But that wasn’t all that Puthoff told him.If the mysterious white powder was indeed losing 44% of its mass, then, saidPuthoff, “theoretically it should be withdrawing from these three dimensions…itshould not even be in these three dimensions.”185[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-185] In other words, thematerial was behaving exactly as one of Puthoff’s “two-dimensionalsuperconductors.”B. SUPERCONDUCTIVITYSo what was his white powder?The occurrence of the mention of superconductivity in Puthoff’s papers naturallyimpelled Hudson into an investigation of these strange objects. Hudson begins bynoting one of the most standard tests of superconductivity, which may beappreciated by comparing superconducting material to an ordinary metal currentcarrier, such as a copper wire. Everyone knows that if one passes a magnet closeto a wire, running it back and forth, the magnetic field of the magnet willinduce a small electrical current in the wire, which, with appropriatelysensitive detection equipment, will be detected. But this is not at all whathappens around a superconductor.Hudson states what happens around a superconductor with his typically colorfuldescriptions:If it’s a superconductor as you apply a magnetic field it goes negative. Itliterally eats the magnetic field. It feeds on the magnetic field and takes itinside itself. Negative inductance in a positive applied magnetic field is theproof of a superconductor.In other words, if you had a machine that was a superconductor when it passed byordinary power lines, it would cancel the voltage potential of the power lines.Or if it passed by a home that had electric appliances it would literally turnthem off and cause them to flicker and go off.186[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-186]But what had all this to do with what Dr. Hal Puthoff told him? As far as Hudsonwas concerned, the ability of his anomalous material to literally leave thesethree dimensions meantthat if you had a machine that would do that, it could literally move in spacetime, is what Hal (Puthoff) was saying? That it could disappear and reappear inspace time….A superconductor is billions and billions of atoms all acting like one big macroatom. And so literally you make yourself a vessel that you can climb inside ofthat superconducts and you energize it and you exclude all external magneticfields including gravity. And you are now in this world but you are not of thisworld. 187 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-187]Hudson’s material was capable, in other words, of the manipulation of the fabricof the physical medium, of “space-time,” itself.While he did not yet know it, David Hudson now held the ancient Philosophers’Stone in his hands.1. CONSCIOUSNESS AND SUPERCONDUCTIVE BEHAVIOR OF DNAHow Hudson came to the conclusion that he was actually holding the alchemicalPhilosophers’ Stone is itself one of the more intriguing aspects of his story.It began when he noticed that a connection was being made in the scientificliterature between superconductivity and biology, with all the rich implicationsfor the idea of consciousness that this entails.While researching superconductivity, Hudson ran across a little paper with therevealing title “Evidence from Activation Energies for Superconductive Tunnelingin Biological Systems at Physiological Temperatures” by Freeman A. Cope.188[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-188] I must confess that when Iread the actual title of this article, I was dumbfounded, for the title clearlyimplied that superconductivity could and did occur in biological systems atordinary “room temperature” so to speak, whereas everything I knew from theliterature implied that superconductivity normally only occurred in extremelycold temperatures, well below those in which life could actually live andthrive.But an actual glance at some of the statements in the article left me even morestupefied:Considerable evidence for semiconduction and for solid-liquid interfacialelectron conduction in biological systems has been obtained from kineticanalyses, which have been supported by electron mobility measurements using themicrowave Hall effect and pulsed electron beam techniques, and by the finding ofa low semiconduction activation energy in the dried enzyme cytochrome oxidase.That’s nice, but what does it mean? Hang on, for the article continues withunusual clarity:In the present paper, evidence for another class of solid state biologicalprocess is given. It is suggested that single-electron tunneling betweensuperconductive regions may rate-limit various nerve and growth processes. Thisimplies that micro-regions of superconductivity exist in cells at physiologicaltemperatures, which supports theoretical predictions of high temperature organicsuperconduction.Superconduction is the passage of electron current without generation of heatand hence with zero electrical resistance. Such behavior has been observed onlyin organic materials and only at temperatures below approximately 20°K, althoughtheory predicts that superconduction might occur in organic materials at roomtemperatures. The conduction of electrons across interfaces between adjacentsuperconductive layers behaves differently from current across ordinary solidjunctions. Electron tunneling currents across interfaces between superconductivelayers or regions have been predicted and demonstrated to have a particular formof temperature dependence…...Little...has suggested DNA as the sort of biological molecule along whichelectrons might superconduct… 189[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-189]In other words, at ordinary temperatures for living organisms, and under certaintemperature conditions, their DNA molecules could actually superconductelectricity! The article even went on to stress the fact that this phenomenonappeared to be tied most closely with nerves. Perhaps this had something to dowith the alchemical claims that the Great Elixir, the Philosophers’ Stone, alsoconferred healing and longevity properties on those who consumed it.But what exactly in the DNA could account for this behavior, and what in DNAcould possibly link it to Hudson’s strange white powder? Hudson set out toanswer these questions, and, focusing on the fact that nerve tissue was somehowinvolved in the phenomenon, procured the brains of cows and pigs, and decided todo an experiment. Hudson immersed the brains in alternating sulfuric acid andwater several times to rid the brain matter of all carbons and nitrouscompounds. What was left was dry matter, approximately five percent of which wasrhodium and iridium — both platinum group metals! — in the high-spin state, thesame state as Hudson’s fine white powder!190[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-190]In other words, Hudson had found a possible connection, via his white powderhigh-spin-state platinum group metals, and via the superconductive properties ofDNA, to the ancient alchemical insistence that the alchemist himself must insome sense be transformed or purified in order to confect the Philosophers’Stone, for consider, we now have:1. matter whose mass exists partly in (56%), and partly outside (44%), of thisordinary three dimensional space (or four-dimensional space-time);2. matter which only exhibits this property after going through intenselystressful chemical processes in which the alchemical “sequence of colors” ismore or less confirmed, and which, as indicated in those texts, exists in a finewhite powder form;3. these properties are apparently related to superconductive properties;4. there is a relationship to DNA’s superconductive properties, which mightaccount for ancient alchemical warnings that the alchemist himself must betransformed in order to confect the Philosophers’ Stone.2. GAMMA RAY BURSTSHudson decided on further tests of his mysterious material to find out exactlywhat the nature of the “explosions” was that he had first observed in hismaterial, the very same explosions that set him off on his quest to understandthe substance. Purchasing an arc furnace and pumping out all the air and thenfilling it with helium, he stirred his material with a tungsten electrode aboutthe size of a human thumb.191[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-191] Supposedly the furnace wassupposed to be able to heat any substance thirty or forty times before thetungsten electrode would burn out.But this was not what happened:We didn’t even get a second out of this thing. So we sent it to themanufacturer, got another electrode, put it back in it, put back on, closed itback up, vacuumed out the out, put in the inert gas, struck another arc, bzzp,shut off. Opened it up again and the tungsten electrode is all molten into thispowder.What we found when we analyzed the powder after we did this, it wasn’t the sameelement it was before we did this. And what we also found is that there was anamplification of heat about two thousand times. It was not chemical heat, it wasnuclear heat.How did Hudson know this? He knew becauseall the wiring in the laboratory was beginning to crumble and fall apart. Youcould go up to copper wires and do that and they would just go to powder.The glass beaker sitting in the laboratory near the furnace was getting full oflittle air pockets in the glass and when we would pick them up they would fallapart. And that’s radiation damage. There is no other explanation for it.192[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-192]Consulting nuclear laboratories, Hudson determined that his “explosions” werereleasing 25,000 electron volts of gamma rays! The “explosions” were gamma raybursts! In other words, the combination of Hudson’s strange high-spin-statepowder, when subjected to electromagnetic radiation of the sun — remember hisinitial observations were formed by drying the substance in sunlight — or of thearc furnace, resulted in the same sort of nuclear transmutations one mightassociate with normal processes of nuclear fission via neutron bombardment, yetno neutron bombardment was occurring! The stresses on the substance were allelectrical and magnetic in nature.3. HUDSON DISCOVERS THE ALCHEMICAL CONNECTIONIt was at this point that Hudson discovered, finally, the alchemical connection.…my uncle came up with this book in 1991 called Secrets of the Alchemists. Isaid “I’m not interested in reading about alchemy….I want to know aboutchemistry and physics. He said “Dave, it talks about a white powder of gold” Isaid “Really?” And so I began to look into alchemy. And the Philosophers’ Stone,the container of the light of life was the white powder gold.Now I said “is there a chance that this white powder of gold that I have, couldit be the white powder of gold they’re talking about? Or it is possible thatthere are two white powders of gold? Now the description says it is thecontainer of the essence of life; it “flows” the light of life. Well, that wehad proven. It’s a superconductor. It “flows” the light that is in your body.(The alchemists) claimed that it perfects the cells of the body.193[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-193]The book was, in fact, published by Time-Life books, and stated that it was abelief of the alchemists that partaking of the white powder gold actually helpedinduce longevity.194 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-194] ButHudson also found, as he investigated alchemical texts, that it all went “backto a man the Hebrews called Enoch, the Egyptians called Thoth,” and who inGreece was the now well-known “Hermes Trismegistus,” the Thrice-Great Hermes.195[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-195]And with Hermes-Thoth, we have closed the circle, and returned to the place andthe concepts from which the quest began: to Egypt, and to its notions of anunderlying physical substrate, a materia prima, which was transmutative, aphysical substrate, moreover, as I have demonstrated in my previous books, thatwas believed to have spatial-cellular properties like an organism,196[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-196] or a lattice structure,like a crystal,197 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-197] thatcould create information from an initial condition of non-equilibrium and aquasi-analogical process,198[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-198] and that was a commonmedium to mind or consciousness, energy, and matter.199[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-199]C. SUPERDEFORMITIES AND THE NEW NUCLEAR PHYSICSBut how, thought Hudson, could one rationalize all this scientifically? Howcould one account for all the strange and anomalous behavior of this “whitepowder gold”? Hudson observed that the U.S. Naval Research Facility had knownand proven that biological cells communicated with each other via some processinvolving superconductivity, but that they could not quite determine exactlywhat was superconducting nor how it was doing it. For Hudson, however, it wasobvious: the reason nothing unusual was showing up in the navy’s chemicalanalyses was the same reasons he had encountered in his own quest to identifythe strange material: they were, as he called them, his high-spin-state“‘stealth atoms’ at work. No one knows they are there, because they don’tidentify by normal instrumental analysis.”200[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-200]His explanation for this behavior, however, is even more intriguing, andsuggests how perceptively he had absorbed not only the alchemical texts he wasnow studying, but also their modern scientific analogues:What they found, was that the nucleus of these atoms deforms, goes to a highspin state, called a high spin nuclei [sic], and theoretically the high spinnuclei should be superconductors, because high spin nuclei pass energy from oneatom to the next with NO NET LOSS OF ENERGY... When you understand that asuperconductor flows with only a single frequency of light, in fact, that lightis a NULL light. In other words, it consists of two waves that are mirror imagesof each other. Because of this mirror symmetry, there is NO WAVE, it APPEARS tocancel. 201 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-201]This requires some rather careful unpacking, and understanding in the context ofthe previous discussion concerning the work of Hal Puthoff.Hudson is here maintaining several things:1. Insofar as the superconductive effects of high-spin-state atomic nuclei areconcerned, this may somehow be due to a resonance effect existing between eachnucleus;2. Such energy and information transfers are not bound by normal laws ofthermodynamics in energy transmission, for there is no net loss of energy, inother words, the transference of energy or information may not even be occurringby standard linear transmissions of energy; some other unknown mechanism must beat work, a mechanism that is perhaps induced by the high spin state itself;3. A portion of Hudson’s “white powder gold,” according to Puthoff, was existingin our normal space-time, and a portion of it was not, but was existing in akind of lower-dimensional sub-space;4. This resonance effect, moreover, may be due to a peculiar zero-summing ofordinary vectors of electromagnetic energy.As will be seen in the final portions of section three of this book, the idea of“sub-spaces” capable of conveying information is part of the geometry of arather interesting and breathtaking theory of physics. But the idea of physicalsub-spaces appears to have been part of the alchemical quest all along. As thefamous esotericist Manly P. Hall observed:As one of the great alchemists fittingly observed, man’s quest for gold is oftenhis undoing, for he mistakes the alchemical processes, believing them to bepurely material. He does not realize that the Philosopher’s Gold, thePhilosopher’s Stone, and the Philosopher’s Medicine exist in each of the fourworlds and that the consummation of the experiment cannot be realized until itis successfully carried on in four worlds simultaneously according to oneformula. 202 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-202]The phrase “four worlds simultaneously” is suggestive enough of an object innormal space-time also inhabiting higher (or lower) dimensional subspaces, butmore importantly, the alchemical quest is carried out “according to oneformula,” implying that one chemical recipe will grant access to these fourworlds simultaneously. Interestingly enough, as we shall see in part three ofthe present work, even the number of “four worlds” is in exact conformity withat least one new theoretical physics model.Even more intriguing is the fact that some alchemists were quite clear,according to E.J. Holmyard, that the Philosophers’ Stone did not occupy space:Dastin seems to endow the elixir with a spiritual nature, so that although itmust be confined in some kind of matter, for otherwise it could not bemanipulated, it nevertheless occupies no space; an idea to which we find aninteresting parallel in the views of Paracelsus.203[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-203]For an ancient or mediaeval alchemist, occupying “no space” would be almost thesame, if not identical, to a modern physicist’s conception of occupying adifferent space simultaneously as it was occupying, in part, the normalspacetime of everyday existence. Indeed, something very much like this isimplied by Holmyard’s remark that the “spiritual nature” of the Philosophers’Stone must be “confined in some kind of matter, for otherwise it could not bemanipulated.” Nonetheless, it “occupies no space.”For all this, it is, however, the fourth point in the previous summary that mustreally preoccupy our attention: “This resonance effect is, moreover, due to apeculiar zero-summing of ordinary vectors of electromagnetic energy.” In itshigh-spin-state, in other words, matter appears to be existing in almost a kindof self-contained space-time “bubble,” wherein all the vectors ofelectromagnetic force it normally exhibits, and which therefore permit normalspectroscopic chemical analysis, cancel out or “zero sum” by being mutuallyopposed in pairs of bi-directional waves. Under this condition, it is obviousthat normal spectroscopic chemical analysis would simply break down and beunable to analyze the material properly, thus accounting for Hudson’s earlyfailures to obtain any consistent chemical analysis of his white powder.But there is something else here, and it should give one pause, for thiszero-summing is precisely the necessary condition for scalar, or torsion,physics, a physics capable of effecting action at great distance with nodiminution of energy; a physics capable of potentially great good for energyproduction, or great evil for creation of hugely destructive weapons. 204[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-204] And clearly, it is thefourth, zero-summed, high-spin-state condition that makes possible the thirdcondition, of a state of matter capable of a partial existence in normalspace-time, and partial existenc00“ or “hyper-space.”1. HUDSON’S PHYSICS PAPERS SOURCES AND A METHODOLOGYBut could Hudson in fact find substantiation for these radical views? Indeed hecould, and even more to the point, the previously outlined summary is preciselythat, a summary of what he found. But what precisely did he find in the physicsliterature? He found a series of papers dealing with “new radioactivities,”“superdeformed nuclei” brought on by “high spin states,” and entirely new modelsof nuclear fission and transmutation not brought about by neutron bombardmentand fracturing of an ordinary non-high-spin nucleus. He details the papers towhich he refers in his public lectures, and accordingly, our methodology herewill be simply to cite what those papers themselves say about these subjects,and occasionally to point out Hudson’s own interpretations of them.205[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-205]2. FORMAL DEFINITION OF SUPERDEFORMITYA convenient definition of these new “superdeformed” nucleonic states is givenin the following short paragraph:...those states known as “superdeformed” (SD) (are) where the nucleus acquires avery elongated shape that can be approximately represented by an ellipsoid wherethe ratio of the long to the short axis is considerably larger than that ofnormal deformation ~1.3:1. Within the framework of the anisotropicharmonic-oscillator model one can expect the existence of favorable shell gapsthat appear regularly as a function of deformation and nucleon number.206[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-206]Reading between the lines a bit, it does not take much to see what is being saidor implied: superdeformed atomic nuclei are “flattened out” due to the muchhigher rate of spin of those nuclei. Rather than tiny little “spheres” ofprotons and neutrons, they are now elongated dramatically. Moreover, note that amodel is even being hinted at for understanding these shapes: “shells,”recalling the early Bohr atom with its electron shells or orbits, eachrepresenting a stage of the excitement of the electron. A similar structure, inother words, is now being proposed for the atomic nucleus of these superdeformednuclei themselves!Moreover, the article also makes the significant observation that these statesare the historical product of investigations of nuclear isomers: “The firstobservation of SD nuclei goes back to the discovery of fission isomers and theidentification of the rotational bands built upon them.”207[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-207] Isomers are unusualisotopes of elements that have almost all of their energy locked up precisely intheir high spin state, or in the angular momentum of their nuclei,208[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-208] so that if one could figureout a way to unlock that energy suddenly, one would have a new and efficientsource of energy, as well as a frightening potential for a bomb, for imaginesomething spinning at an ultra-high rate of revolutions, and then suddenlystopping it, causing it to fly apart in a sudden burst of energy.209[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-209]3. PROPERTIES OF SUPERDEFORMITYA. SPONTANEOUS FISSION AND NEW MODELS OF FISSION IN SUPERDEFORMED STATESAs noted above, one of the most unusual properties of superdeformed nuclei is toundergo spontaneous nuclear fission without neutron bombardment. This is acompletely new and hitherto unknown mechanism of fission. The mechanism isexplained by the “shell model” of the nucleus being adopted by scientists toexplain the superdeformed nucleus and its properties:In particular, new shell gaps appear by inducing a quadrupole distortion in thenuclear shape, where the ratio of the major to minor axis is 2:1… Suchdeformations play an important role in the process of spontaneous fission, wherethe 2.1 configuration is connected with the second minimum of the fissionbarrier, as well as in heavy ion collisions, leading to resonant molecular-likebehavior.210 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-210]Note the extremely elongated shape of the high-spin superdeformed nucleus in a2:1 ratio. This induces “gaps” in the shells of distributions of protons andneutrons in the nucleus, an important concept as we shall see in a moment.But one can imagine what is taking place by drawing an analogy to an ice-skater,spinning and drawing in his arms. As he does so, he spins faster, as the angularmomentum of his contracting arms is transferred closer and closer to the centerof rotation. If we can imagine the skater being made of rubber, he would beginto elongate or, depending upon one’s point of view, “squish” slightly. A similarphenomenon is occurring in the superdeformed nucleus. Notice also the finalcomment: the “bonding” between such atoms begins to occur via resonance in thefrequency of spin states of the nucleus they share. Ordinary chemical electronbonding is thus no longer the main mechanism of molecular bonding.An article in the March 1990 edition of Scientific American explains thesignificance of the discovery of the new form of nuclear fission:The discoveries settled a 40-year old quandary in nuclear physics. Until the1980s it appeared as though the nuclear fragments from radioactive processescame in roughly three sizes: four, 100 or 200 nucleons–a term that refers toboth [sic] protons and neutrons. In the four-nucleon range is the alphaparticle, or helium nucleus. If an alpha particle emerges from an atom, itleaves behind a nucleus composed of approximately 200 nucleons, in the100-nucleon range are the fragments from fission, a process in which a heavynucleus splits roughly in half. The restricted range of sizes raised anintriguing question: Why did a nucleus not emit a fragment composed of otherquantities of nucleons — why not 14 or 24?Today it is known that a nucleus can indeed eject a fragment of this size or anyother. These new radioactivities form when a large number of nucleons within thenucleus spontaneously rearrange themselves in certain configurations. Becausethese large-scale rearrangements occur at random, the emission of a newradioactivity is in general a much rarer event than, say, the emission of analpha particle. By the end of the 1980s, physicists had succeeded in observingmany of these new nuclear ambassadors.211[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-211]The article goes on to explain how the “nuclear shell model” helps to explainthe new process of fission:The resemblances between nuclear shell structure and atomic shell structure arestriking. If the electrons of an atom completely fill one or more shells, as isthe case for helium and neon, the atom is stable: it is chemically inert. If theshell of a nucleus are completely filled, as are those of calcium and lead, thenucleus is stable and consequently spherical.The first nuclear shell can be filled with as many as two protons and twoneutrons; the second shell can be filled with up to six of each nucleon; theother shells are also filled with a certain number of protons and neutrons. Theresult is that one can usually predict the stability of a nucleus just bycounting the number of protons and neutrons. Stable nuclei usually consist of a“magic number” of protons or neutrons; that is, they have 2, 8, 20, 28, 40, 50,82, 126 or 184 protons or neutrons. Nuclei that have double magic numbers areparticularly stable — for example, calcium 48 (20 protons and 28 neutrons) orlead 208 (82 protons and 126 neutrons).212[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-212]But the shell model, as was seen, is not the only geometry at work insuperdeformed nuclei; the other is the elongation, or its converse, the“squishing” or flattening out that can occur in a low spin state, that occurs inthe high-spin state:…(The) shell model assumes a somewhat rigid structure, the collective modelholds that the outer part of the nucleus can deform when the outer nucleons movewith respect to the nucleons of the inner nucleus. This collective motion, ordeformation, derives from the liquid-drop model.Most nuclei are prolate spheroids (cigar-shaped); some are oblate (disk-shaped).These deformations require that the nucleus whose shape changes slowly as energyis added is called a hard nucleus; a nucleus whose shape deforms rapidly fromadditional energy is referred to as soft.213[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-213]But while these models explained why unstable nuclei in the shell model couldassume elongated high spin, or alternatively disk-like shapes, it did not yetexplain why scientists were observing new forms of fission that did not fit inthe previously known model.214[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-214]The answer occurred when scientists realized that, in high-spin situations,nucleons in the outer shells could begin to pull away from the original centerof the nucleus, and form a kind of “proto-nucleus” with a second center of acluster of nuclei within the larger nucleus structure.215[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-215] Thus, while in itshigh-spin state, a heavy nucleus may be chemically analyzable as a particularelement, yet it will contain a substructure of two “clusters” of nucleons, that,in some cases, can fission into two completely different elementsasymmetrically, that is, the fission products do not divide more or less evenly,but into different products that “differ greatly in mass and charge,” and thesefragments, moreover, may be and usually are “several times larger than an alphaparticle.”216 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-216]This “twocenter shell model” not only led to the prediction of new radioactivities, butnew elements and isotopes as well.217[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-217]B. SUPERCONDUCTIVITYAs was seen previously, yet another property of superdeformed atoms is theirability to superconduct, and indeed they do so in some circumstances in only twodimensions. One of the most interesting, but technical, studies that Hudsonconsulted was an article that indicated that in some cases the normal processesof superconductivity itself did not hold in situations of extremely high angularmomentum within the atomic and nuclear system of the superconductor.218[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-218] And this leads us to…4. THE ALL-IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE OF SUPERDEFORMITY: ROTATION AND ANGULAR MOMENTUMBy now it should be obvious what the main mechanisms in these superdeformities,new asymmetrical fission products, and new radioactivities are: rotation andangular momentum. Indeed, the abstract of one of the papers consulted by Hudsoneven put it with rare, non-technical succinctness: “The kinematic and dynamicmoments of inertia of several superdeformed bands are calculated as a functionof the rotational frequency.”219[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-219] As the article’s authors,E. Vigezzi and R.A. Broglia, acknowledge, the whole “discovery of superdeformedrotational bands during the past years opens a new chapter in the study ofnuclei under conditions of extreme deformations and angular momenta.”220[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-220] But the real revelationoccurs in a short comment toward the beginning of their article: “It is wellestablished that the spectra of rapidly rotating nuclei reveal two distinctcomponents in the buildup of the total angular momentum, corresponding toangular moment of orbital angular momentum of individual particles and tocollective rotation.” 221 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-221]In other words, the total system of deformation was comprised of the angularmomentum of individual particles in the nuclear shells, but to the totalrotation of the proto-nucleus “cluster” which they formed. In all cases, thesuperdeformity “was determined self-consistently as a function of the angularmomentum.”222 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-222]And, for those who’ve been following the hyper-dimensional “tetrahedral physics”model of Richard C. Hoagland over the years, there is an intriguing additionaldatum. Let us recall what the principle feature of this physics is. Atetrahedron, if circumscribed or embedded in a rotating sphere, with one vertexof the tetrahedron located on a pole of the axis of rotation, will have theother three vertices of the tetrahedron touching at the latitude of 19.5 northor south on the surface of that sphere, depending on which pole of the sphereone orients the vertex on the axis of rotation. Hoagland has observed thatwithin any massive rotating body, such as a planet or a star, there appears tobe, as a universal feature of this geometry, upwellings of energy at thatlatitude in those bodies, upwellings that are, moreover, vorticular in nature.Interestingly enough, energy seems to gate “into” one of the bands of palladium104 and 105 superdeformities at a most unusual rate of spin: “The feeding of theg7/2 band seems to take place at a spin of 39/2 and therefore the deexcitationpatterns suggests a spin of 43/2 for the first observed level of the newrotational band, with an uncertainty of ± 2 units.”223[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-223] In other words, energyappears to gate into the system when the spin frequency is 39/2, or 19.5 units,and appears to deexcite at a spin frequency of 43/2, or 21.5 units. This is anastonishing correlation of Mr. Hoagland’s “tetrahedral physics” model, andmoreover, is a possible indicator of its scale invariance, for in this case, itis occurring at the nuclear, and not planetary, scale.5. MERCURYNot surprisingly, these superdeformed nuclei also exhibit very anomalous ratesof radioactive decay, a point that will assume some significance in part three.Moreover, in weakly deformed nuclei around the mercury region of the periodictable, there are highly anomalous discontinuities of expected energies withinnuclei, on the order of about 1 MeV (one million electron volts). Mercury, inother words, appears to be the most peculiar element of all, with nucleialready, in their natural state, weakly deformed.224[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-224] One can only imagine — aswe shall do in part three — what happens when mercury is subjected to high-spinstates, and the superdeformities, fission products, and “new radioactivities”that might result. It is, however, interesting to note that Hudson has seen theimplications of the high-spin superdeformed state of palladium for cold fusion,and the nuclear transformations that Pons and Fleischmann and others haveobserved, for as has been seen, in some cases, these superdeformed nuclei canindeed fission asymmetrically, and produce new elements out of their constituent“proto-nucleus clusters.”225[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-225]At the end, what is one to make of Hudson’s quest?It was Hudson himself who uncovered the resemblance of his discoveries to theclaims and practices of alchemy, but even he missed, for all this, perhaps themost significant connection of them all: the strange mass loss anomaly that hismaterial exhibited, for here too, as elsewhere, there is an exact alchemicalforeshadowing of his discoveries.In fact, one famous mediaeval alchemist and theologian, Roger Bacon, noted thatthe Stone could exhibit anomalous weight gain:The second multiplication is an Augmentum quantitatis of the stone with itsformer power, in such a way that it neither loses any of its power, nor gainsany, but in such a manner that its weight increases and keeps on increasing evermore, so that a single ounce grows and increases to many ounces.226[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-226]The title of Bacon’s treatise in which this quotation occurs has its ownsignificance as well: Tract on the Tincture and Oil of Antimony, for as we shallsee in the next part of the book, one of the chemical compositions suggested forthe mysterious Soviet “Red Mercury” is precisely the compound mercury antimonyoxide, and, if the stories about the “Soviet Mercury” are true, Red Mercury wassupposed to be an extraordinarily and anomalously dense and heavy substance.Even more suggestively, Paracelsus, commenting on “the projection to be made bythe mystery and arcanum of antimony” states that “no precise weight can beassigned in this work of projection…. For instance, that Medicine tingessometimes thirty, forty, occasionally even sixty, eighty, or a hundred parts ofthe imperfect metal.”227 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-227]While the basic sense of this passage is usually taken to mean that the“tincture of antimony” is able to transform and transmute an anomalous amount ofmaterial in proportion to its own weight, there might indeed be another meaning,since “no precise weight can be assigned in this work of projection.” In otherwords, perhaps Paracelsus himself had observed some anomalous weight gain orloss in his alchemical tinctures.In any case, it is as unlikely as it is true, that the anomalous behavior ofHudson’s “white powder gold” exhibited its most anomalous behavior, not in whatit was doing in and of itself, but in what it did to Hudson, by leading him to aserious study not only of ancient and mediaeval alchemy but also of modernnuclear theory. In this, perhaps, his material had affected a truly alchemicaltransmutation, for Hudson, like all other alchemists, had ended his quest withhis thoughts and outlook utterly transformed."},{"pageContent":"5CONCLUSIONS TO PART TWO012 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_012_r1.jpg]“As we progress, we shall see that the Stone of Paradise (which is heavier thangold, but lighter than a feather) is no myth of the distant past. It now holds aprimary position in the world of modern physics, with its baffling weight ratiosfully explained as a scientific fact.”Sir Laurence Gardner228 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-228] Hudson’s unique quest to understand the anomalous white powder he had extractedfrom his soil samples permits us now to draw certain tentative conclusions aboutthe relationship between ancient and mediaeval alchemy and modern physics:1. The basic principles and assertions of certain alchemical texts are verified,namely:a. with respect to the color sequence indicating successful confection of thePhilosophers’ Stone: Hudson, via known and standard chemical and physicaltechniques, was able to replicate the overall color sequence of the derivationof the Philosophers’ Stone. As was seen, two of these colors, a cranberry-redcolor, almost the color of grape juice, signified a stage in the process whichended with a fine “white powder of gold”;b. with respect to the composition of the Philosophers’ Stone: As was seen fromchapter one, many alchemical texts stressed the powder form of the Philosophers’Stone, a form amply demonstrated by Hudson’s material;c. with respect to the Philosophers’ Stone “occupying no space yet beingconfined in matter”: As was seen, one of the most significant anomaliesexhibited by Hudson’s white powder was its unusual mass loss anomaly, an anomalythat physicist Hal Puthoff explained by maintaining that some of the materialwas actually existing in a wholly different space and time, a “sub-” or“hyper-space.” Thus, alchemical texts that indicate the existence of thePhilosophers’ Stone in different “worlds” would appear to be capable ofinterpretation along hyper-dimensional physical models.2. In turn, these anomalous properties appear to be based upon:a. Extraordinary or non-ordinary geometries and shapes of atomic nuclei inelements within the platinum group to mercury range in the periodic table of theelements; these are in turn the result of,b. extremely high-spin states of the nuclei; furthermore,i) in some cases these states are excited at a spin frequency of 19.5, anddeexcited at a spin frequency of 21.5, in apparent correlation of the“tetrahedral physics” model of popular Mars anomalies researcher Richard C.Hoagland; that is to say, energy appears to gate, in some elements, into thesystem at 19.5, and to exit or deexcite at 21.5, indicating the possibility thatHoagland’s model might be scale invariant;c. the total angular momentum of the system, which is composed of twosub-systems:i) the individual particles in the nuclear shells; and,ii) the total angular momentum in the “proto-nuclear cluster” of thesuperdeformed nucleus;3. These superdeformed atoms apparently bond in “quasi-molecular fashion” via aresonance phenomenon related to the spin frequencies and angular momentum oftheir various nucleus shells;4. These superdeformed atoms likewise can undergo spontaneous asymmetricalfission without neutron bombardment, and often can yield extremely high burstsof gamma radiation when deexciting from their high-spin state. The weaponizationpotential and implications of this phenomenon will be explored in the next twoparts of the book. Similarly, superdeformed nuclear isotopes in a high-spinstate do not decay at standard rates of radioactive decay.The significant and crucial role of angular momentum and rotation throughoutHudson’s alchemical quest and in the physics of nuclear isomers andsuperdeformed nuclei, as exhibited by the existence of a portion of Hudson’swhite powder in an entirely different sub-space or hyper-space, points to adeeper underlying physics, to that of the folding and pleating of space-timethat results from the phenomenon known as torsion. And to understand the effectof torsion on matter and the formation of exotic states of matter, we must crossthe ocean, to Russia, and to Germany, and visit the groundbreaking, andbreathtaking, work of Russian theoretical and experimental physicist NikolaiKozyrev, and the even more astounding work of Nazi Germany, and a postwar Germanphysicist all but unknown to American physics, who, however, has come to thedefinite attention of NASA..."},{"pageContent":"Part ThreeTHE SOVIET “MERCURY”013 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_013_r1.jpg]“With beating heart, Flamel watched for the revealing colours.

During that decade, stories began to appear inthe Western European and American media that agents of various “nations ofconcern” — Libya, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and so on — were caught red-handedtrying to buy a substance called “Red Mercury” that had been smuggled out of theold Soviet Union’s secret laboratories and nuclear stockpiles. One would expect,of course, that such nations would be more interested in acquiring plutonium-239or uranium-235, or the reactor and enrichment technologies to make them. But no,their agents were seized after trying to purchase at enormous sums a cherry-redliquid goo called “Red Mercury.” And in that, there lies yet another difficulttale.Part of the difficulty concerning the Red Mercury story lies in the completelyambiguous and often contradictory explanations that were offered for the wholeepisode, not to mention the dubious explanations put forward for the substanceitself. The difficulty is further compounded by the fact that a broad range ofmagical and indeed “alchemical” capabilities were alleged for the substance, andthat it, like the alchemical Philosophers’ Stone itself, was confected by arather arcane “recipe” whose constituent chemical elements were only vaguelyknown or guessed at. And like the Philosophers’ Stone itself, its alleged usesseemed to change according to the needs of the buyer. In this, it has all thehallmarks of a modern retelling of the quest of mediaeval alchemy. Many, whonoticed this odd resemblance, were therefore inclined to write off the wholestrange episode as a deliberately concocted hoax. The problem with thatexplanation, as we shall see, is that it does not really do justice to the wholepicture. Indeed, if it were a hoax, why then did nations such as Libya, Syria,Iraq, Iran, and North Korea fall for it? There had to have been enough truth inthe hoax to hook such buyers, who certainly had scientists sophisticated enoughto smell a fraud, if indeed that is what it was.So, what exactly is “Red Mercury” and what has it to do with the modernalchemical quest for the Philosophers’ Stone?A. VARIOUS EXPLANATIONS OF THE RED MERCURY SCARE1. THE “SIMPLE HOAX” EXPLANATIONThe explanations for the Red Mercury scare are no less diffuse and ambiguous asthe claims for the substance themselves. Some speculate that the scam wasnothing more or less than a complete and simple hoax, perpetrated on anunsuspecting — and by implication, somewhat dimwitted — nuclear terrorismcommunity by the psychologically much more sophisticated Russian intelligenceservices, which sold nothing more than depleted uranium, spent reactor fuel,cobalt or cesium, or other such materials to their “marks” for enormous sums ofhard cash.230 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-230] But how doesone account for the fact that the Russians were so successful in these efforts?Surely the purchasers — which included scientifically sophisticated nations suchas South Africa, Iraq, and Iran — would have had the scientific prowess todetect a fraud. Indeed, this highlights the strong possibility that the wholeRed Mercury episode “seems to have been so widespread and common is likelyrelated to the fact that there is some truth in the claims made by the conartists.”231 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-231] The questionintensifies when one considers the additional, and contradictory, fact that“much-publicized statements from British, Russian, and U.S. governmentofficials” exist, statements that in no uncertain terms assert that “no materialmatching the properties of red mercury exists, and no such material is used inthe construction of nuclear weapons. How, then, did red mercury become thecommodity of choice for con artists and unwitting buyers?”232[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-232] This problem becomes veryacute, since long after such official denials were made public, the UnitedKingdom nevertheless brought two men to trial for conspiracy in an alleged plotinvolving nuclear terrorism and Red Mercury! So, if it was a complete hoax, whythe trial? And if not a complete hoax, why the official denials? One explanationfor the denials may lie in those nations’ concern that a real threat wasinvolved, and their wishes to reassure their populations, and curtail the blackmarket trade in nuclear weapons materials.But convenient as that explanation may be, it still does not dissolve theproblem of the various explanations. Indeed, as one observer of the controversypointed out, the term “Red Mercury” may itself be nothing more than a code name,with the word “Red” denoting its origin in Communist Russia, and “Mercury”simply being a code word for the high heats and pressures involved withthermonuclear fusion. The substance, whatever it was, may not therefore be acompound of mercury at all.233[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-233] As will be seen, thesespeculations are in line with the alleged “recipe” of Red Mercury itself.2. THE ANTI-TERRORISM COUNTERINTELLIGENCE HOAXA somewhat more sophisticated version of the “hoax” explanation is that thewhole Red Mercury episode was a cleverly conceived anti-terrorismcounterintelligence operation launched by the Russian government, with theprobable collusion of Germany, the United Kingdom, and other Westerngovernments. The ostensible goal of this alleged operation was to infiltrate,expose, and implicate terrorist cells attempting to procure nuclear weaponsmaterials on the black market that emerged in the wake of the Soviet Union’scollapse.Supporters of this explanation point out the fact that the post-CommunistYeltsin government of Russia began to run articles about Red Mercury in theRussian media, articles which were soon picked up and circulated further byWestern media agencies. With the appearance of the stories, a black market forthe substance was created, and Russia’s vast intelligence capabilities swunginto action in concert with Germany’s Bundesnachrichtendienst, Britain’s MI-6,and America’s CIA, shutting down potential terrorist threats. The stories madethe substance almost impossible to resist, for it was alleged that Red Mercurycould actually detonate an H-bomb without the need of an atomic bomb as the fuseto set it off.For the would-be nuclear terrorist, this was a literal Allah-send, sincehydrogen bombs are vastly more powerful than atomic bombs, much “cleaner,” and,if no A-bomb is involved, would be much easier to engineer and deploy.Red Mercury thus afforded a short cut to a more powerful weapon without the needfor nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities, all of which are large,stationary, and costly facilities easily targetable by their potential enemies.Indeed, since on the standard physics model an A-bomb is needed as the “fuse” todetonate an H-bomb, nuclear non-proliferation efforts have always focused on theneed to limit and closely monitor fissile materials and fuel enrichmenttechnologies, since these are the technologies that require such comparativelylarge and stationary facilities. The Red Mercury legend thus did an end runaround all of that.While there is much to commend this interpretation, and in fact, I believesomething very much like this is involved in the origins of the Red Mercuryscare, the question that hung over the “simple hoax” explanation also hangs overthis one as well: how could scientifically sophisticated nations fall for it,unless there was some element of truth mixed into the legend?234[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-234]3. THE BBC’S PROBLEMATICAL STATEMENTS OF 2006Perhaps the most baffling and problematical part of the Red Mercury story is thefact that it is not a story that died in the 1990s, as the conventional views ofit maintain. It seems to have a contemporary life of its own. On Tuesday, July25, 2006, BBC reporter Chris Summers authored a story entitled “What is RedMercury?” concerning the conclusion of a trial of two alleged nuclear terroristswho supposedly tried to buy the mysterious compound. Summers notes that duringthe trial the substance was exposed as being “something of an urban myth, asubstance which was either radioactive or toxic or neither, depending on who youspoke to.”235 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-235]Were this all that the BBC article said, however, we would have nothing morethan a restatement of the “simple hoax” or “terrorist intelligence operationhoax” explanations. While the alleged conspirators were eventually acquitted,what is of interest is not the trial itself, but the BBC’s reporting of it. Hereis how Summers summed up the various theories then circulating on the internetand in the press, and how he ended his BBC article: The five main theories are:• That red mercury is a reference to cinnabar, a naturally-occurring mercuricsulphide. The red pigment derived from cinnabar is known as vermillion.• That it is a reference to the alpha crystalline form of mercury iodide, whichchanges to a yellow colour at very high temperatures.(This is sounding familiar!)• That it is simply referring to any mercury compound originating from theformer Soviet Union. The ‘red’ tag would simply be a legacy of the Cold War era.• That it is a ballotechnic mercury compound which just happens to be red incolour. Ballotechnics are substances which react very energetically whensubjected to shock compression at high pressure. They include mercury antimonyoxide which, according to some reports, is a cherry-red semiliquid produced inRussian nuclear reactors. This theory contends that it is so explosive that afusion reaction — a nuclear explosion — can be triggered even withoutfissionable material such as uranium.• That it is a military code word for a new nuclear material, probablymanufactured in Russia.Putting all of this into context, Summers observes thatIn the early 1990s, in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, severalarticles were published claiming that a pure fusion device had been invented.It reportedly weighed around ten pounds and was no bigger than a baseball.If such a device existed, and was capable of triggering a nuclear explosion, thethreat to the world — especially the Western world — would be catastrophic.But no such bomb has been discovered and nobody — not even Osama bin Laden fromhis mountain base in Afghanistan or Pakistan — has even threatened to use one.So is red mercury just a hoax?Let us hope so. 236 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-236]And on that ambiguous and disturbing note, Summers’ article ends and thequestions begin once again.The first of these questions concerns both the content and timing of Summers’article, for it was published long after the “threat” had long since beendenounced as a complete hoax not only by the Western powers but by Russiaherself, yet, Summers’ article reproduces the main alleged capabilities of RedMercury — its ability to trigger an H-bomb — and the proliferation nightmares itinvokes. Moreover, unlike the earlier official and unambiguous denunciations ofthose governments, the BBC article ends, not with a reassuring restatement ofthose denials, but with a disturbing question and a less-than-confidentstatement of “hope.” Since the BBC is well-known as a media organ of the Britishgovernment, it would thus appear that earlier official denunciations haveretreated once again into questions and vague hopes that the Red Mercury legendis not true.There are two equally disturbing ways of interpreting this most recent officialretreat from the variations of the “hoax” explanation. First, one might see inthe BBC’s cautious article an attempt to prepare the climate of Western publicopinion for further assaults within its territory, of a nuclear or, even worse,a thermonuclear nature, from whatever source. The corollary to this, of course,is to prepare the climate of opinion in the West for further curtailments ofpersonal sovereignty and liberty and for an increase in the police statemeasures and culture beginning to emerge in Western nations in the wake of the9/11 attacks.But the second way of interpreting the BBC’s mystifying “about-face” is that theWestern intelligence agencies themselves suspect that there was, after all, somekernel of truth in the whole Red Mercury story. Thus, while the story may indeedhave been concocted as an elaborate anti-terrorism operation in collusion withRussia, the Russians themselves may have been running a psychological ordisinformation operation against the West within an operation ostensibly beingrun in cooperation with it. As such, there had to be, at a multitude of levels,a buried kernel of truth in order for the whole thing to work, not only againstits terrorist targets, but the secondary target, the West, itself.If so, then what is that hidden kernel of truth? What could it be? To answerthese questions, we must turn to the alleged uses and purported recipe of RedMercury, with a view to a possible scientific rationalization of them. It is thescience of the substance itself that constitutes both the mystery and thepossible solution to the Red Mercury riddle.B. ITS ALLEGED USESIn the legend of Red Mercury, the substance has such a variety of alleged usesand properties that it might with some justification be described as magical oralchemical. It is described as being a powerful “ballotechnic” explosive in itsown right such that an amount no larger than a hand grenade could blow an entireocean liner out of the water. It has also been noted that one consistent elementin the legend is that it is also capable of functioning as a detonator in anH-bomb without the need for an atomic bomb as the fuse. But there are obscurerreports dating from the earliest period of the emerging legend that alsodescribe it as a kind of “radar stealth paint,” and even more curiously, as a“stimulated gamma ray emitter.” Can any of these alleged properties bescientifically rationalized, much less all of them together? The answer requiresa closer look at each of them.1. “STEALTH PAINT”An article in the magazine New Scientist appeared in 1996 that summed up thedilemma of the wide variety of uses alleged for Red Mercury. Outlining a reportprepared on the mysterious substances by Los Alamos National Laboratory, thearticle noted thatThe supposedly top secret nuclear material was ‘red’ because it came fromRussia. When it resurfaced last year in the formerly communist [sic] states ofEastern Europe it had unaccountably acquired a red colour. But then, as a reportfrom the US Department of Energy reveals, mysterious transformations are redmercury’s stock in trade.The report, compiled by researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory, showsthat in the hands of hoaxers and conmen, red mercury can do almost anything theaspiring Third World demagogue wants it to. You want a short cut to making anatom bomb? You want the key to Soviet ballistic missile guidance systems? Orperhaps you want the Russian alternative to the anti-radar paint on the stealthbomber? What you need is red mercury.237[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-237]Stop and consider this list carefully, for it contains significant clues, aswill be seen.First one has the now standard and persistent core of the Red Mercury legend,namely, that1) It has something to do with a powerful explosive, able to simplify atom bombconstruction, or, alternatively as has been seen, able to detonate the far morepowerful H-bomb without an A-bomb fuse;2) It is thus a powerful conventional explosive, and therefore valuable as such,in its own right, for in order to compress fusion fuel to the necessary heat andpressures to achieve nuclear fusion, it would have to be extraordinarilypowerful.But now we encounter two new alleged uses, seemingly quite unrelated to theabove uses:3) It has something to do with ballistic missile guidance; and,4) It has something to do with radar stealth or camouflage, i.e., it haselectromagnetic shielding or screening properties.Bear these four points in mind, for as will be seen, there is a unified way tospeculatively rationalize all of them scientifically, and as such, there may notonly be a kernel of truth to the whole Red Mercury story, but that kernel oftruth in turn implies that Russia’s and the West’s own subsequent attempts todebunk the whole story may itself be a component in disinformation intelligenceoperations.2. “BALLOTECHNIC EXPLOSIVE”The core of the Red Mercury story, as noted above, is that the substance was apowerful new type of “conventional” explosive known as a “ballotechnic.” Tounderstand this part of the story with the full implications of this componentof the Red Mercury legend, it is necessary to go back to what I wrote about itin my book The SS Brotherhood of the Bell. I will cite the passage without thecustomary indented block quotation, but with its own block quotations, in itsentirety: “Red mercury, or mercury antimony oxide — chemical symbol Hg2SbsO7 — enjoyed ashort, if notorious, career as the nuclear threat of the nineteen nineties. Thestory broke more or less simultaneously in various parts of the world, as themysterious substance appeared to be behind a series of murders in the blackmarket arms trade in post-apartheid South Africa, blocked smuggling attempts inthe then recently-reunified Germany, and according to some stories, was evenbeing sought by such ‘nations of concern’ as Libya and Iraq as a basis for theirown nuclear weapons programs. Then, almost as soon as the mysterious compoundappeared, denunciations of the whole substance and subject as a ‘hoax’ wereissued by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and various other nationaland international nuclear regulatory agencies.“But one physicist who did not dismiss the story as a pure hoax was the Americaninventor of the neutron bomb, Dr. Sam Cohen. For Cohen, the possibility of ‘purefusion’ bombs — that is, hydrogen bombs that do not require an atom bomb astheir trigger — was brought home to him while he was on a visit to the LawrenceLivermore Laboratories during a visit he made there in the spring of 1958.During this visit, Cohen was briefed on a pure fusion bomb project.This device, code-named DOVE, fascinated me. It contained no fissile material;rather, its explosive power derived from heavy hydrogen — deuterium and tritium.Because of its extremely low nuclear cost and its high yield–comparable to thatof a very large conventional bomb — it would in a military application,represent a revolutionary new class of weapons. A device of this nature, havingthe yield the equivalent of 10 tons of TNT, could kill enemy troops out tohundreds of yards, with no significant urban destruction and contamination.238[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-238]The interest such a device held for the American military was more than justtheoretical, for such devices would cost ‘roughly one-hundredth that of abattlefield fission weapon, meaning that these things could be turned out by thehundreds.’“The theory behind such a device was simple.The most promising approach was to use a large spherical high-explosive chargeto concentrate the explosive energy in a very small capsule containing deuteriumand tritium. In theory, this would cause the desired thermonuclear reaction. Theprogram proceeded for some years and finally was terminated for lack ofprogress. Later, the Los Alamos laboratory had a go at it. But to mydisappointment, and theirs, the problem remained intractable. The program wasultimately ended. 239 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-239]That is, theoretically, it should be possible to take the implosion detonatorfor a conventional atomic bomb, and instead of using it to compress a criticalmass of plutonium to initiate fission, one could replace the plutonium withdeuterium or tritium, compressing it sufficiently to increase the energy anddensity, and hence the statistical probability of collision (fusion) of heavyhydrogen atoms, and voila! One would have a ‘small’ hydrogen bomb without theneed of an atom bomb to detonate it.“But the effort failed, and it should be obvious why: no conventional explosivepossessed sufficient brisance to compress the heavy hydrogen to pressuressufficient to initiate fusion reactions. This affords a clue to what Dr. Cohenis not telling in his article: the United States was searching for aconventional explosive of sufficient bursting power that, when used in animplosion detonator, would compress heavy hydrogen to fusion energies andpressures. If such could be found, then the atom bomb would become as extinct asthe dodo bird, for two obvious reasons. First, if such a conventional explosivecould be found, then it could be used as a powerful explosive in its own right,replacing the need for small yield strategic and tactical fission weapons, sinceit would be far smaller than a fuel air bomb of similar yield, and far lesscostly than its fission counterparts. Secondly, if such an explosive could befound, then, as Cohen intimates, it could be used as the detonator for a verysmall, ‘clean,’ neutron-emitting hydrogen bomb, or, as Cohen does not intimate,as the detonator for the city-and-county-cracking blockbuster strategic hydrogenbomb. In either case, the cost would be far less than a conventionalthermonuclear bomb.“However, as Cohen relates, there the story ended, until the crack-up of theSoviet Union and the new Russian Republic’s willingness to be more open aboutits nuclear weapons research.Several years before Livermore began DOVE, the Soviets had started their own“pure-fusion” development. Unlike the U.S. they were quite open about it,claiming it was directed solely for peaceful applications. In 1957, Sovietnuclear-weapon designer I.A. Astsimovich presented a paper in Geneva describingexperiments done in 1952, based on the same high-explosive implosion technologyused in DOVE. He claimed progress had been made. Shortly thereafter, however,Soviet researchers stopped all public mention of the project.On the other hand, the Soviet military had no hesitation in writing about suchdevices in their open military literature. In 1961, Colonel M. Pavlov, writingin Red Star, discussed almost precisely what I had briefed Paul Nitze on.Pavlov’s calculations of weapons effectiveness were almost identical to mine,which were classified. This indicated to me that although the Soviets were nottalking about research on DOVE, they were doing it.240[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-240]Then, in 1992, a Russian nuclear weapons expert revealed details about what theRussians called ‘third generation nuclear weapons,’ weapons that could ‘doublethe yield’ with a ‘hundredfold reduction of weight compared to existingweapons.’241 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-241] Cohen citesanother Russian authority on the subject as stating ‘You can drop a couple ofhundred little bombs on foreign territory, the enemy is devastated, but for theaggressor there are no consequences,’242[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-242] for with such weapons thereis none of the deadly, long-lasting radioactive fallout. Again, one is remindedof the Nazis’ use of fuel-air bombs in their rocket batteries on the easternfront, only in this case, it really is a combination of the phrases ‘tacticalnukes’ and ‘carpet bombing.’“As Cohen explains, the ‘doubling of yield’ with a ‘hundredfold reduction inweight’ clearly indicates that the Russians were not talking about standardbattlefield tactical nuclear weapons, since even the most pure plutonium stillhad to be at least a few hundreds of grams simply to have enough material togenerate spontaneous fission. Below a certain threshold of weight, fission wasimpossible, and a one hundredfold reduction would make a fission weaponinconceivable. The Russians therefore had to have been talking about a purefusion weapon, about ‘some version of DOVE, based on a detonation technologythat doesn’t exist in the United States.’243[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-243] In other words, there wereonly two options for interpreting the Russians’ remarks: either they were lying,or they had discovered the holy grail of thermonuclear bomb engineering, aconventional explosive with enough brisance to compress heavy hydrogen to fusionpressures and energies.“And with this Cohen comments, albeit only briefly, on a whole new type ofconventional explosive, of which red mercury is but one substance:In recent years unclassified research has been conducted on a new class ofmaterials (including red mercury), referred to as ballotechnics. These materialsuse a number of elements in low density powder form. When they are subjected tohigh-pressure shock compression, chemical reactions take place which undercertain conditions can produce energy concentrations considerably in excess ofthose from high explosives. Ballotechnics therefore offer a significantlygreater prospect for success in attaining a very low yield pure-fusion weaponthan the high explosive techniques we and other nations have explored.244[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-244]Cohen also notes that red mercury was allegedly developed in the former SovietUnion precisely as a detonator for nuclear warheads. Indeed, its efficiency as adetonator was so great that a bomb the size of a hand grenade would besufficient to blow a large ship out of the ocean.245[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-245] After taking note of thefact that the CIA and various other American agencies dismissed the ‘redmercury’ story as a hoax which they nevertheless were taking seriously —‘whatever that means,’ Cohen quips246[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-246] — he then says nothing moreabout it.”19 And there my survey of the initial stages of the Red Mercury legend in The SSBrotherhood of the Bell ended. A number of important points must be summarizedbefore we proceed:1. The United States, and the Soviet Union, beginning in the 1950s, weresearching for a means of detonation of hydrogen bombs without the need of anatom bomb as the “fuse.” They were thus searching for a relatively“fallout-free” form of thermonuclear bomb;2. This in turn implies that both nations were searching for a powerful andwholly new type of conventional explosive able to compress heavy hydrogen tofusion pressures, heat, and energies, which would be a powerful conventionalexplosive in its own right;3. The American program, at least, is a matter of public record, and thus, thekernel of the Red Mercury legend — that dealing with the allegation of thecreation of a whole new class of very powerful “conventional” explosive — is farfrom being a hoax, but is true. Small wonder, then, that Western intelligenceagencies were quick to dismiss the whole Red Mercury scare as a hoax, for if thestory were really appreciated for what it implied — a quick, atom-bomb-lessroute to the hydrogen bomb — nuclear proliferation became a nightmare, asthermonuclear wars, and terrorism, became a venture free of the falloutconsequences to an aggressor state or terrorist group employing it;4. Moreover, as Cohen rightly notes, Soviet sources and literature were not onlyquite open about their quest for the pure fusion bomb, they were also involvedin the quest fully three decades before the emergence of the Red Mercury storyin the 1990s! The Soviets were, in fact, researching the possibility in more orless the same time frame that the United States was. One has only to ponder,then, what might actually have been accomplished in those three decades afterthe early 1960s, when those Soviet sources suddenly became very quiet about thenature of that research.5. Finally, the timing of the sudden Soviet silence on their research, aftersuch a period of openness, is quite important; according to Cohen, the firstmention of Soviet research occurred in 1957, and referred to experiments begunin 1952, and the last more or less open references appeared in 1961, close tothe timing of Russia’s detonation of its massive fifty-seven-megaton “Tsar”hydrogen bomb, and a few months later, the Cuban missile crisis.Note those dates, for the terminus ante quem would place the beginnings of theresearch a scant seven years after the end of the Second World War, and theterminus post quem would not only place it close to the dangerous nuclearconfrontation of the Cuban Missile Crisis, but, as we shall see in the nextchapter, to a period of the most highly classified secret Russian research of aseemingly entirely different matter altogether. Finally, these dates wouldcoincide with the period of open atmospheric tests of hydrogen bombs by both theUnited States and the Soviet Union. These three things — the close proximity toWorld War II, the period of atmospheric hydrogen bomb testing, and the suddensilence of Soviet sources after the early 1960s — will be significant clues tobear in mind throughout the rest of this book.But what of “ballotechnic” explosives themselves? How would they really work?One method — missed by most commentators — is that ballotechnics may not even beexplosives in the conventional sense at all. A conventional explosive releasesits energies in the form of rapidly expanding gases. But a ballotechnicexplosive might actually accomplish its peculiar and unique detonating qualitiesby an entirely different mechanism: the sudden release of ultra-high heat andelectromagnetic radiation. Instead of generating a compression shock wave ofpressure from detonation of an implosion core around an atom bomb, aballotechnic might release such intense heat in the form of electromagneticradiation that fusion would be initiated.247[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-247]3. A “STIMULATED GAMMA RAY EMITTER”In this regard, it is interesting to note that one alleged property of RedMercury was speculated to be its capacity as a high emitter of gamma rays undercertain conditions of stimulation. One commentator on the internet, WilliamYerkes, posted the following comment to Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D.:I don’t think it’s a mercury derivative at all — I think the label “mercury” isa sort of metaphor, suggested by the proximity of the planet Mercury to the Sunand also, perhaps, by the association in the mind between temperaturemeasurement and mercury…. “Mercury” seems to be an obscure and oblique referenceto high temperatures and, therefore, perhaps, to fusion. And the name may wellhave been a project name, later adapted to the product itself. As to “red,” thisis the color usually used to signify danger, and often to signify “heat” aswell. Also apropos, if we assume the stuff exists. Assuming this, I’ll call itRM.The story is that RM is shock-sensitive ballotechnic. I suspect that this too isrelated only in an obscure somewhat metaphorical way to the material. I suspectthat RM is a stimulated gamma emitter....It is possibly hafnium 178m2 or anothersubstance that, similarly, can be pumped to a high state and collapsed nicelywith the attendant emission of high energy photon(s). I speculate thatstimulated by the input “shock” of a burst of gamma or possibly ionizingradiation from an electronic or radioactive “trigger,” the nuclei of the“pumped” RM atoms, if they exist, become extremely unstable and rapidly (<1nano-second perhaps) collapse to a lower energy level, releasing high energyphotons in the form of gamma with, presumably, an energy level >5000 (millionelectron volts). Open sources cite gamma radiation in excess of this level.The ignition threshold for deuterium-tritium fusion (D+T) is, as I understandthings, 5000 (million electron volts).248[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-248]The mention of the hafnium metastable 178 spin 2 isomer is significant, for thisisomer was itself the subject of a recent U.S. project, sponsored by the DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), to achieve a “hafnium isomer bomb,”an extraordinarily powerful weapon.As mentioned in my book The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, a nuclear isomer hasmost of its energy locked up in its high-spin state, such that, if a methodcould be found to de-excite such atoms — to suddenly shock and slow them down,so to speak — enormous amounts of energy would be released for a smallinvestment of material, as the energy loss of angular momentum in such isomerswould be suddenly released as photons, i.e., as a burst of high frequencyelectromagnetic radiation: gamma rays. Indeed, as I also observed in that book,one little-known physical effect, the Mossbauer Effect, was observed whencertain nuclear materials, under conditions of acoustic stress, would releasecohered bursts of gamma rays, i.e., would become the “optical cavity” for agamma ray laser, itself an extraordinarily powerful weapon.249[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-249] In other words, Yerkesspeculates that such cohered gamma ray bursts from a de-excited nuclear isomermight possess high enough energy potentials to initiate a fully fledgedthermonuclear fusion reaction without an atom bomb.There is a highly significant clue here, and the reader will have noticed it atonce: the basic mechanism in use by ballotechnic explosives might very well betheir high-spin state, and the sudden “shock” or “slowing down” of that state.The careful reader will also have noted that one feature of such ballotechnicexplosives, as noted by neutron bomb inventor Dr. Sam Cohen himself, was thatthey existed in a powder state. Shades of David Hudson, for not only did hismaterial “explode” in sudden bursts of gamma rays, but the testimony of alchemyitself has been that the Stone of the Philosophers radiates “light” and isitself indestructible! Adding all this together, then, it is lookingincreasingly unlikely that the Red Mercury story was or is a mere hoax; thereare too many coincidences piling up, and more importantly, there is a way ofrationalizing a scientific basis for its alleged properties.4. THE STRANGE CONTRADICTION OF DUPONT’S MERCURY ANTIMONY OXIDEIf one examines the record closely, it is seen to contain a peculiarcontradiction. As the excerpt from my book The SS Brotherhood of the Bell madeclear, one possible chemical compound candidate for Red Mercury is the substancemercury antimony oxide. This compound was first synthesized and registered inthe international chemical register by the American defense contractor DuPont in1968, with the registry number 20720-76-7.250[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-250] What is so unusual aboutthis entry is that “no documentation exists to explain its possible uses and thecompany was not prepared to comment.”251[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-251] However, another sourceimplies that it is a liquid explosive of high density!252[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-252]Consequently, if one takes what has been said thus far and combines it together,and if one moreover accepts for the sake of argued speculation that what hasbeen said is true, then one is dealing with the following elements:1. A liquid explosive2. of high density3. whose ballotechnic properties are the result of de-excitation of itshigh-spin, and perhaps isomeric or superdeformed, states, resulting in an“explosion” or extreme burst of high-frequency gamma rays.Note also the new peculiar resemblance to the Philosophers’ Stone, for inCohen’s version, it is a powder resembling David Hudson’s monatomic platinumgroup elements, and in the DuPont mercury antimony oxide version it is ahigh-density liquid. And lest it be forgotten, one of the primary candidates forthe alchemical tincture was precisely a tincture of antimony; moreover, mercuryantimony oxide would indeed be red in color.5. THE PLATINUM METALS GROUP AGAIN: HUDSON AND THE RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENTRECONSIDEREDThe mention of Hudson’s platinum group monatomic high-spin-state elements priesopen yet another door to the Red Mercury mystery, that of the possible role ofplatinum group metals — or to be more precise, a platinum group metal — in itschemical recipe.In their article “Nuclear Trafficking Hoaxes: A Short History of Scams InvolvingRed Mercury and Osmium-187,” researchers Kenley Butler and Akaki Dvali note thatone little known substance involved in the 1990s Red Mercury nuclear traffickingscare was the platinum group metal isotope osmium-187:Two non-fissile substances that frequently have been used by con artists assubstitutes for nuclear materials are so-called red mercury and osmium-187.Hoaxes involving both substances have become legendary after being the subjectof widely reported trafficking attempts throughout the 1990s. A major reasonthese scams have been so widespread and common is likely the fact that there issome truth in the claims made by the con artists. Red mercury is the name givento an alleged nuclear weapons ingredient that does not exist in the form(Hg2Sb2O7) and with the characteristics described by nuclear scam artists. Someexperts have suggested, however, that red mercury is in fact another name forlithium-6, a substance that can be used in the production of compact and highlyefficient thermonuclear devices. Osmium-187 is a bona fide nonradioactivematerial not used for weapon construction, but because it is indeed an expensivecommodity and one that is produced through a process similar to uraniumenrichment, nuclear traffickers seized on it as a marketable product.253[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-253]While the authors’ attitude toward the Red Mercury story is obvious from thetitle of their article and their initial comments, the only thing further thatthey offer about osmium-187 is that “No sooner had red mercury begun todisappear from media reports than nuclear traffickers began touting a newcommodity — osmium-187 — as a vital substance for the creation of nuclearweapons. Osmium is a metal of the platinum group used to produce very hardalloys for fountain tip pens, instrument pivots, phonograph needles, andelectrical contacts.”254 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-254]They also note that the naturally occurring isotope osmium-187 is not includedon any U.S. government agency list of prohibited or regulated materials. Itsonly other possible use, they note, might be construed by con artists to be as atamper for a nuclear weapon because of its extreme density, a role however forwhich the much less costly beryllium, with its high neutron reflectiveproperties, is much better suited.255[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-255]But as we saw in part two, osmium can also exist in the rare high-spin state, astate leading to “superdeformities” of the ordinary atomic nucleus, able tospontaneously fission and capable of “new radioactivities.” About thispossibility, which so mystified David Hudson, they say nothing. Nevertheless, itexists in the peer-reviewed physics literature.There is something else to be noticed here, and it is quite important to thebuilding case. Recall that in the previous section of the book, Hudson actuallyconsulted Russian expertise in order to understand the mysterious properties ofhis platinum group metals. In fact, without that expertise, he could not haveproceeded with the analysis of his material.256[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-256] So once again, the Russiansappear to have been doing some sort of sophisticated analysis of platinum groupmetals long before the Red Mercury story broke. The question is, why? Beforegoing into the detailed analysis of the next chapter, we are permitted tospeculate here that they had perhaps themselves, as early as the 1960s, alreadydiscovered some of the high-spin superdeformed states of this group of metals.If so, then the Red Mercury legend takes on yet another aspect of authenticity,for why else would they have developed the sophisticated analytical techniquesthey did if they were only analyzing ordinary platinum group metals, which wouldbe analyzable by other less costly and less involved chemical means?And there is another connection to Hudson as well that is worth recalling inthis context. As noted above, one speculated property for a ballotechnicexplosive substance is not only its high-spin state, but as an emitter of gammarays. As we saw in part one, Hudson’s mysterious platinum group compoundexploded when dried in the sun, and, as we also saw, Hudson eventually learnedthat these “explosions” were due to sudden bursts of gamma ray emissions!257[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-257]C. ITS STRANGELY ALCHEMICAL RECIPE AND THE STRANGE BEHAVIOR IT CONJUREDBeyond all of Red Mercury’s strangely alchemical associations — its form aseither a powder or liquid, its high density and spin state, its emissions ofhigh bursts of light and gamma rays, and its obvious associations with two ofthe colors in the sequence of colors denoting a successful confection of thePhilosophers’ Stone, yellow and red, all of these things being in turn the nowfamiliar properties of the Philosophers’ Stone itself — there is also the matterof its strange recipe or, as the case may be, recipes. And this, as they say, iswhere it gets really interesting.1. THE ALLEGED CLASSIFIED RUSSIAN REPORT ON RED MERCURYAn entry into this most interesting aspect of the story is afforded by a strangecomment found on one lone internet site, which referred to an alleged classifiedRussian report on Red Mercury:According to a report by Yevgeny Primakov, chief of Russia’s externalintelligence service, to (then) Secretary of State Gennady Burbulis of March 24,1992, red mercury is used in the production of high-precision fuses forconventional bombs and fuses for nuclear bombs, in the starting of nuclearreactors, in the production of anti-radar coatings for military hardware and inthe manufacture of self-targeting warheads for high-precision missiles.258[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-258]While there is little new here regarding the alleged uses of Red Mercury, whatis unusual is the supposedly high level from which the whole catalogue ofalleged applications originates: at the pinnacle of Russia’s intelligence andforeign services.The site then follows with a clear indication that, in the opinion of thecompiler of the information, this too is a part of the hoax!Certainly this makes a great deal of sense in the context that the whole 1990snuclear trafficking scare was a deliberate intelligence operation by theRussians in collusion with Western powers against potential terrorist threats.Likewise it makes a great deal of sense if, as has been suggested, the Russiansmounted a further disinformation operation against the West wrapped inside oftheir collaboration with the West, for what better way to stamp both operationswith the air of authenticity than by the deliberate leak of a contrived “topsecret” report? Certainly the Russian intelligence agencies were very skilled,and practiced, in such operations.2. THE PRESS CAMPAIGN AND SUBSEQUENT RUSSIAN DEBUNKINGWith this in mind, the subsequent “press campaign” concerning Red Mercury, bothinside of Russia and in the West itself, makes a little more sense. In theirarticle mentioned previously, Kenley Butler and Akaki Dvali summarize thisinitial press campaign, in which even more alleged uses for the substance werecirculated:References to red mercury began to appear in major Russian and Western mediasources in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The articles were never specific asto what exactly red mercury was, but the accounts claimed that the substance wasa valuable strategic commodity and a necessary component in a nuclear bomband/or that it was important in the production of boosted nuclear weapons.Supposedly citing a leaked Russian government memorandum, an April 1993 articlein the widely-read Russian daily Pravda reported that red mercury is “asuper-conductive material used for producing high-precision conventional andnuclear bomb explosives, ‘stealth’ surfaces and self-guided warheads. Primaryend-users are major aerospace and nuclear-industry companies in the UnitedStates and France along with nations aspiring to join the nuclear club, such asSouth Africa, Israel, Iran, Iraq, and Libya.” Red mercury was peddled throughoutEurope and the Middle East by Russian businessmen, who made fortunes in theprocess…. Described as a brownish powder or a red liquid, red mercury was saidto originate from various locations in the USSR, namely Ust-Kamenogorsk,Kazakhstan, and Krasnoyarsk, Novosibirsk, and Sverdlovsk in Russia.Western media also carried accounts of red mercury and its nuclear applications.According to a July 1993 article in Nucleonics Week, red mercury was a code wordused in the USSR nuclear weapons program since the 1950s to describe enrichedlithium-6, which, according to the article, can be used to produce tritium,which, when fused with deuterium, can be used in the fusion stage of athermonuclear weapon. Lithium-6 received its code name because of the red-huedimpurities in the mercury used to produce lithium-6. According to the article,the USSR built a large complex in the early days of its nuclear weapon programto produce and stockpile lithium-6.The Nucleonics Week article was followed by two television programs on redmercury produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation as part of itsDispatches series. Trail of Red Mercury (1993) and Pocket Neutron (1994)presented “startling new evidence” that Russian scientists had designed asimple, cheap, pure fusion weapon or neutron bomb, the size of a tennis ball,using a “mysterious compound” called red mercury. A June 1994 article in thevenerable International Defense Review quoted Western and Russian nuclearphysicists as confirming the existence and destructive capabilities of redmercury. One of those quoted, U.S. nuclear physicist Sam Cohen, to this daycontinues to write passionately about the nuclear applications of red mercury,which he describes as a “ballotechnic” explosive that, “when ignited, does notactually explode but stays intact long enough to produce the enormoustemperatures and pressures sufficient to enable deuterium-tritium fusion.”259[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-259]If the intention of the Russian and Western intelligence services was to concocta disinformation campaign designed to entrap terrorist cells trading in theblack market for nuclear arms and materials, then they could not have done abetter job of placing the stories than in these prestigious professional andmedia journals and outlets. Once again, however, note the reference to high spinin the form of super-conductivity and its peculiarly alchemical-soundingpowdered and liquid form.3. THE STRANGELY CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS OF BRITISH PHYSICIST FRANK BARNABYThe subject of Red Mercury’s recipe — which would at least provide a measure ofcorroboration or rebuttal of the idea that the substance was genuine — becomeseven more peculiar with the strange behavior exhibited by those directlyinvolved with the story. On February 21, 1992, for example, Russia’s thenPresident Boris Yeltsin signed Decree No. 75-RPS entitled “On the PromekologiyaConcern.” This decree granted the company Promekologiya Company, based inEvkaterinenburg, exclusive rights to “produce, store, transport, and sell 84tons of red mercury for $24.2 billion over a three year period to a Van NuysCalifornia company called Automated Products International.”260[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-260] The decree was laterrescinded on March 20, 1993, amid confusion of whether or not any of thesupposed material had ever actually changed hands.261[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-261] Following this bizarre turnof events, the accounts of Red Mercury trafficking in Russia dried up andwithered away, and a media campaign was apparently mounted to debunk the wholeidea of Red Mercury, as government authorities began to deny “its veryexistence.”262 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-262]As these sources indicate, at the height of the Red Mercury scare, the storywent all the way to the top of the Russian government, to the office of theRussian president himself. And as they also indicate, at one point the storyinvolved an American corporation. So whatever was going on — hoax,anti-terrorist disinformation campaign, or genuine article — it came from a veryhigh level within Russia, and implied a measure of non-Russian involvement aswell.This strangely contradictory behavior prompted some strangely contradictorybehavior of its own from British physicist Frank Barnaby. At first on record asto his belief that the substance and at least some of the claims for it weregenuine, Barnaby noted that “the thing that has to give you pause is theseniority of the Russians who are claiming it exists and has these applications,and it’s very hard to see these people involved in a hoax.”263[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-263] But then, later on, Barnabyapparently reversed himself, for according to an article in the Britishnewspaper, The Guardian: “Nobody would dream of getting that stuff for a dirtybomb,” the article reported, noting that Barnaby was a nuclear physicist at theUnited Kingdom’s Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston during the 1950s.According to the article, Barnaby stated that “For a terrorist it would offer nosignificant advantages over an ordinary high explosive or, if they wanted adirty bomb, a radioactive source. To go to the trouble of spending huge amountsof money on red mercury makes no sense at all.”264[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-264] It makes no sense, unlessof course the substance’s alleged property of being able to triggerthermonuclear explosions without an A-bomb as the “fuse” possesses some basis inreality.What is one to make of all this confusion? Was it a hoax? A deliberatedisinformation operation of the Russian government, wrapped within yet anotherintelligence anti-terrorism operation being run jointly with the West? Or was itthe genuine article, and were the subsequent efforts of the Russian governmentto brand it as a hoax due to the fact that it was doing hasty “damage” controlin the wake of a disastrous policy of “openness” on the part of the Yeltsingovernment?Clearly, no examination of the record of Red Mercury stories by themselves willyield an answer, for that record is ambiguous at best and contradictory atworst. One must turn to actual statements of its alleged recipe in order to finda possible scientific rationalization that could shed light on the question ofwhether or not it was a hoax, or the genuine article.4. VARIOUS RECIPES AND STABLE FEATURESNot surprisingly, one of the first hints at the recipe of Red Mercury came fromAmerican physicist and neutron bomb inventor Sam Cohen, who suggested it wasmanufactured under “ultra high pressure. You knock all these electrons out soit’s not the same atom. It pulls a lot more energy per gram than any otherexplosive that I’ve ever heard of.”265[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-265] When pressed for moreinformation, Cohen also observed that “I think it’s very difficult to tell howit was made from examining the substance itself.”266[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-266] Ultra-high pressuremanufacture, as will be seen, is indeed a strong possibility for being onecomponent in the recipe of Red Mercury.But the actual chemical recipe remains a mystery. Candidates include mercurysulfide — the alchemists’ cinnabar — mercury iodide, and of course mercuryantimony oxide, which, as already has been seen, has its own dubious ambiguityin the record, with some sources claiming it has powerful explosive properties,and with another source — DuPont, its actual chemical inventor and fabricator —declining to talk about it at all! Moreover, one does not have to look far todiscover alchemical references to antimony but these do not seem to imply anyexplosive use! Nonetheless, antimony was a substance of some interest toalchemists in their quest to confect the Philosophers’ Stone.The mediaeval alchemist Roger Bacon, for example, devoted a whole treatise tothe subject called Tract on the Tincture and Oil of Antimony. Notably, Bacontwice refers to this tincture of antimony as having a red color.267[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-267] Then, toward the end of thetreatise, comes this astonishing statement made in the context of thePhilosophers’ Stone and its transmutative powers:The second multiplication is an Augmentum quantitatis of the stone with itsformer power, in such a way that it neither loses any of its power, nor gainsany, but in such a manner that its weight increases and keeps on increasing evermore, so that a single ounce grows and increases to many ounces.268[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-268]Bacon’s comment recalls that of another famous alchemist, Paracelsus, whom wehave previously mentioned in connection to this mass anomaly, and who apparentlyobserved more or less the same thing much later:No precise weight can be assigned in this work of projection, though thetincture itself may be extracted from a certain subject, in a definedproportion, and with fitting appliances. For instance, that Medicine tingessometimes thirty, forty, occasionally even sixty, eighty, or a hundred parts ofthe imperfect metal.269 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-269]While not saying it in so many words, Bacon and Paracelsus appear to besuggesting the same sort of high mass and density anomalies as were alleged forRed Mercury itself, and doing so centuries earlier to boot!And even though Bacon does not record for his “tincture of antimony” anythingremotely resembling the uses alleged for Red Mercury — much less its use as adetonator in a fusion bomb — Bacon does make a very suggestive commentconcerning the association of antimony to celestial alignments, and to oneparticular constellation:The Arabs in their language, have called it Asinat vel Azinat, the alchemistsretain the name Antimonium. It will however lead to the consideration of highSecrets [sic], if we seek and recognize the nature in which the Sun is exalted,as the Magi found that this mineral was attributed by God to the ConstellationAries.270 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-270]Antimony, in other words, was in the alchemical lore deliberately associated notonly with celestial geometries in general, but to one constellation inparticular: Aries, Mars, the god of war. A suggestive connection if ever therewas one!As is also evident, the alchemists were familiar with some substance ofabnormally high density and weight.In any case, notwithstanding this further ambiguity in the official explanationssurrounding mercury antimony oxide and DuPont’s reluctance to discuss thecompound, in an article in New Scientist magazine, reporter Jeff Nyquistsuggested that the mysterious Red Mercury even played a role in the recentAmerican allegations of Iraq possessing “weapons of mass destruction,”allegations that formed a crucial justification for its invasion and militaryoccupation of that country.271[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-271] If, as I have previouslysuggested, the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq was really concerned aboutweapons of mass destruction of a far more ancient sort — the fabled Sumerian“Tablets of Destinies” — and if as I have also suggested elsewhere that thesetablets were crystalline in nature, then indeed there may be an “alchemical”connection, given alchemy’s own preoccupation with metals and gems, i.e., withsubstances having lattice structures, then it may be, as Nyquist suggested, that“American intelligence has evidence of something dire, something they don’t wantto tell us.”272 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-272]In this respect, some suggested compounds for Red Mercury involve elements withvery unique lattice structures, structures that make them efficient neutronemitters. One such suggestion was that the substance was a compound of ordinarymercury and plutonium-239, the fuel for a plutonium bomb. Other mixtures weremercury and californium, or mercury and polonium. In other words, one stablefeature of the alleged recipe seems to be some compound of mercury and anefficient neutron-emitting radioactive isotope. Such characteristics gave RedMercury a definite “shelf life,” depending on what particular isotope wasalloyed with the mercury itself. Indeed, this aspect of its recipe seems toinvolve the previous one, manufacture under conditions of ultra-high pressure,for yet another stable feature of its alleged recipe is that it was manufacturedin a reactor, under high pressure and neutron bombardment.Gathering together all that has been learned about the substance, its allegeduses, properties, and manufacture, we have the following stable elements:1. It could allegedly be used as a radar-absorbent paint, and possessed radarstealth properties;2. It possessed super-conductive properties, suggestive of a high-spin state;3. It was manufactured under ultra-high pressure and in a reactor under neutronbombardment;4. The substance was a compound of mercury and other elements, most likelyradioactive;5. It had unique lattice properties that allowed for anomalous and great densityand made it an efficient emitter of neutrons and in some versions of gamma rays;6. In one instance, that of mercury antimony oxide, there appears to be analchemical connection, suggesting that perhaps alchemical texts themselves werethe ultimate instance for the substance;7. And finally, of course, there is the whole legend that the compound was aspecial kind of “ballotechnic” explosive, able to trigger a hydrogen bombwithout the need of an atom bomb for the detonator.So once again we are confronted with a substance that would appear to involve atleast one verifiable property — a high-spin state — which as we saw in part twoin our examination of David Hudson’s anomalous material, could emit sudden“explosive” bursts of radiation in the form of gamma rays. Moreover, like themysterious Red Mercury, Hudson’s substance exhibited anomalous weightproperties. In Hudson’s case, the anomaly was in the weight loss, whereas in RedMercury’s case, the anomaly is in its unusually high density, its mass, its“weight” gain. But what was the reason for manufacture under high pressure?D. CONCLUSIONS AND CONNECTIONSThe confection of Red Mercury under high pressure by neutron capture in areactor suggests the possibility that the Russians, like the Americans, hadnoticed anomalous yields exceeding calculated values in their H-bomb tests ofthe late 1950s and early 1960s. And like their American counterparts, they hadprobably also noticed that these yields varied with time and therefore withlocal celestial geometry. By confecting the substance under these conditions —high pressure and neutron capture in a reactor — they were perhaps trying toapproximate the conditions inside the fusion capsule at the center of theimplosion that set off a thermonuclear bomb, which, again, is one of “highpressure” (and therefore heat) and neutron bombardment. If this line ofspeculation be true, then the Russians were engaged in materials engineering ofa substance that could transduce that very same anomalous energy, the veryenergy of those local geometries of time itself into this world, the veryenergies that were being evidenced in thermonuclear explosions. They were indeedperhaps after their own version of the Philosophers’ Stone. But in order tounderstand what the process of their scientific rationalization may have been indoing so, indeed, in order to have a real scientific foundation to the RedMercury legend, we must turn to the breathtaking and brilliant work of one ofRussia’s most gifted and virtually unknown physicists, Dr. Nikolai A. Kozyrev,and to the possible reasons his work was so highly classified by the formerSoviet Union. And as will be seen in the next chapter, with Kozyrev we are, onceagain, paradoxically confronted with the persistence of the main tenets ofalchemy and its claims for the Philosophers’ Stone."},{"pageContent":"7TIME IS NOT A SCALAR NIKOLAI KOZYREV’S CAUSAL MECHANICS015 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_015_r1.jpg]“Since, then, our matter is our root for the white and the red, necessarily ourvessel must be so fashioned that the matter in it may be governed by theheavenly bodies.

Paracelsus273[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-273] Without any possibility of doubt, Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev is one of the unsunggiants of twentieth-century theoretical and experimental physics. In him wascombined that rare Einsteinian mixture of the profound thinker and the carefulobserver and experimenter. Even with the advent of the internet, however, thisintellectual giant’s work remains largely unknown in the West, and even, to acertain extent, in his native Russia.The reason for his relative lack of fame is quite simple. As researcher DavidWilcock, who first brought Kozyrev’s work to the attention of the modern Westernaudience, states, “The awesome implications of his work, and of all those whofollowed him, were almost entirely concealed by the former Soviet Union….”274[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-274] In other words, Kozyrev’swork was so awesome and extraordinary in its implications, not only for thedevelopment of the foundations of theoretical physics, but also for itsdangerous potential applications, that the Soviet leadership wisely classifiedit at the very highest levels. Indeed, it was Kozyrev, in fact, who laid theexperimental basis and outlined the theory of Soviet research into that area ofphysics often called “scalar” physics, but it might equally, and probably withmore justification, be called “torsion” physics. But before one can have anappreciation of the enormous scope and implications of his work, one must havean insight into the man and his extraordinary life.A. A BRIEF CURRICULUM VITAE OF DR. NIKOLAI A. KOZYREVDr. Nikolai A. Kozyrev lived from 1908 to 1983,275[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-275] a time frame that makes hima contemporary of several famous scientists: Einstein, Planck, Heisenberg,Schrödinger, Jordan, Dirac…on and on the list could go. And of course he is acontemporary of yet another unsung physics genius, and a namesake: Nikola Tesla.But there is a deeper connection between the two men, as David Wilcock observes.Tesla, Wilcock notes, stated in 1891 that the physical medium “behaves as afluid to solid bodies, and as a solid to light and heat.” Moreover, with“sufficiently high voltage and frequency” the medium itself could be accessed.This was, as Wilcock correctly notes, Tesla’s “hint that free energy andanti-gravity technologies were possible.”276[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-276] It is Tesla’s assertionthat the medium has fluidlike properties that ties his work directly with thework and thought of Dr. Kozyrev.277[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-277]Publishing his first scientific paper at the “tender age of seventeen,”278[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-278] Kozyrev graduated from theUniversity of Leningrad when he was twenty years old with a degree in physicsand mathematics, and “by age twenty-eight was widely known as a distinguishedastronomer who had taught at several colleges.”279[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-279] In 1936, however, Dr.Kozyrev ran afoul of the repressive regime of Stalin, during the “purge” crazesof the time, and in 1937 he began eleven long years in the Soviet gulag systemuntil his release in 1946.280[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-280] It was during016 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_016_r1.jpg]Dr. Nikolai A. Kozyrevthis period of harsh servitude in the Gulag that Kozyrev noticed, and reflecteddeeply upon, the phenomenon that would guide his subsequent thought andexperimentation upon his release. This was the fact that so many different formsof life exhibited asymmetrical properties and a spiraling growth pattern.281[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-281] In this, Kozyrev’s approachis similar to that of the Austrian naturalist Viktor Schauberger, who noticedthe same spiraling growth patterns, and who, like Kozyrev, would ponder andinvestigate the underlying physics of this pattern, and come to very similarconclusions.282 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-282] UnlikeSchauberger, who was not a trained physicist or mathematician but a naturalistand forester, Kozyrev was formally and academically trained in thesedisciplines. Thus, Kozyrev, like Schauberger, would pursue his observations tothe overturning of many of theoretical physics’ most prized dogmas, but unlikeSchauberger, he would frame his philosophical objections with the formalmathematical precision a physicist could understand and accept.Wilcock notes that it was during the winter of 1951–52 that Dr. Kozyrev beganthe first of a series of experiments that would last fully thirty-three years,experiments that were, and are, by any lights, intriguing, and to say the least,controversial.283 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-283] What madethem controversial was that Kozyrev viewed the spiraling patterns of nature andof life itself as a manifestation of time,284[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-284] and that as a consequenceof this view, time itself was not a dimensionless “coordinate point” or a“scalar” as scientists and mathematicians would call it, but that time wasitself a kind of physical force, and a very subtle one at that.017 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_017_r1.jpg]Dr. Kozyrev in Later LifeBut what, really, had brought this quiet thinker to such an unusual conclusion?As mentioned previously, Kozyrev was an astronomer, and in fact he himself“considered the determination of the nature of stellar energy to be the maingoal of his scientific activity.”285[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-285] In fact, Kozyrev’s 1947doctoral thesis was on this very topic and was entitled “The Theory of the InnerStructure of Stars as the Basis for Research of the Nature of StellarEnergy.”286 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-286] As such,Kozyrev is considered to be one of the “pioneers of Russian theoreticalastrophysics,”287 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-287]developing a theory of the distant photosphere of stars in 1934. This work,subsequently extended and generalized by the Indian physicist Chandrasekar,became known as the Kozyrev-Chandrasekar theory.288[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-288] Kozyrev is also responsiblefor a number of other discoveries related to the planets of the solar system.But it is not for this public and known work that Kozyrev is so significant; itis for the classified work that he did for the Soviet Union, work that was,moreover, inspired by his publicly known astronomical discoveries and thought.In the previous chapter I mentioned the fact that early atmospheric hydrogenbomb testing returned some very anomalous results. For example, when Americadetonated the first hydrogen bomb — code-named “Mike” — in 1952, its calculatedyield was in the neighborhood of six megatons. But the bomb, once fired off, ranaway to a yield of about ten megatons, a rather significant difference.Moreover, I have speculated, since my first book The Giza Death Star, that suchtesting revealed anomalous gains (or decreases) in yields depending upon thelocation of the test or detonation and the local celestial geometry and time itwas conducted.289 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-289] In otherwords, there was another source of energy being transduced by the geometries ofthe detonation, gating significant amounts of energy into the explosion thatcould not be accounted for by standard calculations of neutron cross-sections,statistical analysis of fission chain reactions, heat and pressure gradients ofa fusion reaction, and so on. Something else was going on, and this “somethingelse” was the real reason for continued nuclear testing by the then twosuperpowers, and it is the real reason for more recent additions to the nuclear(and thermonuclear) club to continue their nuclear tests; consider only Franceand China. They are trying to learn those laws.Dr. Kozyrev’s work is directly related to this question, though he approachedthe problem via a slightly different, though highly relevant, route. In short,when he compared “the observed data about luminance, masses, and sizes ofstars,”290 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-290] the observedluminance and radioactivity could not be adequately accounted for by the theorythat stars are nothing but gigantic hydrogen bombs in a state of perpetualdetonation; the theory of thermonuclear fusion alone was inadequate to accountfor the phenomenon of stars. Indeed, Kozyrev’s analysis “brought him to aconclusion that the processes of thermonuclear synthesis cannot serve as a mainsource of stellar energy.”291[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-291] In other words, thefusion-gravity geometry model of standard stellar processes — a geometric modelinspired in large part by Einstein’s General Relativity and extrapolations fromit performed by other scientists — was simply not able to account for theenormous energy pouring out of stars. Some other mechanism altogether was atwork.What mechanism did Dr. Kozyrev tentatively conclude was the source of thisanomalous energy output? The Russian physicist Dr. Lavrenty Shikhobalov puts thematter with a succinctness and clarity that belies the significance of whatKozyrev had concluded: “The scientist (Kozyrev) made a hypothesis that Time is asource of stellar energy.”292[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-292] In other words, Kozyrev hadconcluded that the geometry of local celestial space is a determinant in theenergy output of fusion reactions, and that the latter, depending upon thatgeometry, will “gate” now more, now less, energy into the reaction itself as afunction of that geometry. Kozyrev had, in short, surmised why the Russians —who had no doubt encountered similar anomalous energy yields in their ownhydrogen bomb tests — were getting such strange results, results that could notbe explained on the standard theory and its methods of calculations of yields.B. AN ALCHEMICAL ASIDE: PARACELSUS ON THE INCORPORATION OF CELESTIAL GEOMETRIESINTO ALCHEMICAL APPARATUSBefore continuing with the examination of Dr. Kozyrev’s work, it is worthpausing to reconsider once again the similarity to the assertions of alchemy. Aswas seen throughout part one of this book, alchemical texts over and over againrefer to the importance of the moon, the planets, and more importantly, the Sun,to the proper and successful operation and confection of the Philosophers’Stone.In the epigraph which began this chapter, the most famous (or perhaps,notorious) alchemist, Paracelsus, puts the matter in no uncertain terms:Since, then, our matter is our root for the white and the red, necessarily ourvessel must be so fashioned that the matter in it may be governed by theheavenly bodies. For invisible celestial influences and the impressions of thestars are in the very first degree necessary for the work....293[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-293]However, note that Paracelsus says another significant thing in this quotation,and attention is drawn to it lest it be overlooked: not only are the celestialgeometries essential to the confection of the Stone, but the apparatus, thetechnology itself, must in some fashion embody that influence or allow it towork directly upon the material being made in it. This, as we shall see, isprecisely the principle in evidence in one of Dr. Kozyrev’s most astonishingpieces of experimental equipment.294[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-294]C. TENSORS, TIME, AND TORSIONAs we shall come to see in the next chapters, torsion forms an essential, andindeed the central, component of Dr. Kozyrev’s experiments. Accordingly, it isnecessary to have a basic idea of what torsion is, and what it does.Torsion may be defined as a spiraling motion within the fabric of space and timethat folds and pleats that fabric by twisting it. The simple analogy of emptyinga soda pop can, and then wringing it like a dishrag, illustrates what torsiondoes. The spirals in the can literally fold and pleat, and the can’s lengthcontracts. This, essentially, is what torsion does to space-time. This spiraled,folded, and pleated structure is described by a mathematical entity called atorsion tensor, of which there are two versions, a relatively weak one, known asthe Einstein-Cartan tensor, and a stronger one, known as the Ricci tensor. Weshall concentrate our attention in a moment on the Einstein-Cartan version.1. VARIOUS VIEWSBesides two different versions of the torsion tensor, there are also slightlydifferent views of what torsion actually represents, and to some extent, the two— the versions of the torsion tensor and the views of what it represents — arerelated. For example, we have illustrated the folding, spiraling, and pleatingof space-time by the simple example of wringing a soda pop can, and indeed, themost common usage of torsion is to indicate precisely these things. However, insome cases not only is this in view, but the degree or amount of the spiralingand folding taking place.But for Kozyrev and the Russian scientists who continued his work, torsion meansall this, and something else as well. For them, torsion came to represent a kindof “sub-space” or “hyper-space” — a higher structured order — that gives rise tothe fabric of space-time of the ordinary world.2. THE STRENGTH OF TORSION IN THE EINSTEIN-CARTAN TORSION TENSORIt was the mathematician Elie Cartan that first injected the idea of torsioninto Einstein’s General Relativity Theory. As researcher David Wilcock pointsout, however, the difficulty was that, in Cartan’s version of the mathematics,“torsion fields would be some 30 orders of magnitude weaker than gravitation,and gravity is already known to be 40 orders of magnitude weaker thanelectromagnetic energy.”295 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-295]As a result of this extremely small amount of force, torsion fields “werebasically an irrelevant footnote that would not make any noticeablecontributions” to observed phenomena in the real world.296[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-296] Moreover, in theEinstein-Cartan version, torsion itself remains a static field, accounting onlyfor the spin orientation of a single system.297[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-297]3. THE RICCI TORSION TENSORBut there is another, stronger version of the idea in mathematics, the Riccitensor, named after the Italian mathematician who discovered it. In thisversion, the curvature of space-time is stronger and not a mere “footnote” in anotherwise mathematically elegant theory. In fact, in some uses the Ricci tensordenotes not simply a static field, but an actual flow and structure to time,almost as if it possessed fluid-like properties, a point that will become quiteimportant in our analysis of Dr. Kozyrev’s work.4. DYNAMIC TORSION, VORTEX MECHANICS, AND TIMEWith the idea of the Ricci tensor we are confronted by the fact that torsion isa dynamic and changing phenomenon, and not merely a static field, for if thebasic idea of torsion is that it is related to a rotating system, then it willbe apparent that the universe is composed of rotating systems within otherrotating systems, producing a continuously changing system with a changing flowof time. And if in addition those spinning systems are in turn emitting energy,such as a star pouring out its electromagnetic radiation from the fusionreactions within it, then that dynamic changes yet again, and with theconstantly changing “spiraling and pleated” field of time, time itself takes ondynamic properties.Such complex, interlocked systems of rotation may be thought of as “knots” ofspace-time that are so intensely concentrated that they form the objectsobserved in the physical universe. As such, all systems are in fact “space-timemachines,” and since they “contain” space-time they are not ultimately“constrained” by it, but rather, interact constantly, and in some cases,instantaneously, with it.And this means that physics had to modify its mathematical modeling of time andspace significantly. Or, as Dr. Kozyrev would imply, “time is not a scalar…”D. DR. NIKOLAI KOZYREV ON THE NATURE OF TIME: THE PHYSICAL MECHANICS OF CAUSEAND EFFECTIn our examination of the thought and experiments of Dr. Kozyrev that nowfollow, we shall rely heavily on his own statements and mathematicalargumentation, and equally upon the commentary of those who have studied hiswork, particularly Russians, in order to exhibit the fact that the fullimplications of his work were more than adequately understood by the Soviets,who, for obvious reasons, sealed it tightly behind a wall of high classificationand KGB and GRU security.Dr. Kozyrev outlined the fundamentals of his whole physics and philosophicalapproach in a paper first published in 1967: “The Possibility of ExperimentalStudy of the Properties of Time.” The title itself is suggestive, andbreathtaking enough. But the contents of the paper — especially for one rearedin the milieu of post-relativistic physics — as Dr. Kozyrev like all academicphysicists was, is even more stunning. He announces his philosophy, and program,in no uncertain terms:In reality, the exact sciences negate the existence in time of any otherqualities other than the simplest quality of “duration” or time intervals…. Thisquality of time is similar to the spatial interval. The theory of relativity byEinstein made this analogy more profound, considering time intervals and spaceas components of a 4-dimensional interval of a Minkowski universe. Onlythe…geometry of the Minkowki universe differentiates the time interval from thespace interval. Under such a conception, time is scalar and quite passive. Itonly supplements the spatial arena, against which the events of the universe areplayed out. Owing to the scalarity of time, in the equations of theoreticalmechanics the future is not separated from the past; hence, the causes are notseparated from the results. In the result, classical mechanics brings to theuniverse a strictly deterministic, but deprived causality. At the same time,causality comprises the most important quality of the real world.298[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-298]This densely packed, tightly-argued paragraph requires considerable unpacking inorder for its truly breathtaking nature to be truly appreciated. Even then, aswe shall see, it only hints at the breathtaking program and implications thatKozyrev outlines in the rest of his paper.First, take note of the two basic points Kozyrev has made:1. Time is not merely a “scalar” or “one-dimensional entity” in the geometry ofspace-time; it is not, therefore, to be viewed in the sense that the geometry ofGeneral Relativity — the Minkowski space — or for that matter, most physicaltheory, views it, namely, as merely duration; and,2. That because physics has tended throughout the centuries to view time in onlythis way — as mere duration — modern physics in particular has no reallyadequate way to distinguish cause from effect with formal, mathematical,explicitness.The last point may seem somewhat obscure, but it is directly related to thefirst point, and to what Kozyrev calls the “scalarity” of time, so it is best tohave some basic understanding of what a “scalar” is in mathematical terms. Bydoing so, one will have an appreciation for its typical use in mathematicalphysics.1. TIME IS NOT A SCALARA “scalar” is simply a term for what, in many mathematical languages, is simplya “dimensionless” entity, like a “point” in the kind of geometry one learned inelementary school. If one recalls that elementary school geometry, for example,a line required one dimension, a plane required two dimensions, and a realphysical object required three dimensions, to describe them mathematically.What Einstein did in his General Theory of Relativity, as many know, is that hemade time a fourth dimension in the mathematical description of an object, sinceany physical object not only existed in space, but endured in time.But this dimensionless “duration-only” description of time was completelyinadequate, according to Dr. Kozyrev, for by pointing out the “scalarity” oftime, he is simply pointing to the obvious fact that as a “dimensionless” entityit is not comprised of further “parts,” so to speak. One cannot thereforeadequately distinguish a “cause” from its “effect” within mathematical physicswith any degree of formal, mathematical precision, since this idea of “mereduration” is incapable of further formal analysis. Time, on this physical view,was a passive player, and not an active contributor, to physical processes andforces. It was merely a backdrop or stage on which those processes and forceswere played out. By viewing time as a non-scalar, Kozyrev has announced hisphilosophy, and his program: time is active and possessed of its own inherentparts and qualities, and experimental physics must investigate these with allthe scientific rigor as it investigated other active forces and properties inprevious centuries. With this insight, in other words, Kozyrev announced awholesale assault on two of the foundations of modern physics and some of itshidden, and very counterintuitive, assumptions: Relativity, and QuantumMechanics.But only General Relativity has been mentioned thus far in this connection. Whatdoes the “non-scalarity” of time mean in terms of Quantum Mechanics? To answerthis, one must delve a little further and deeper into his paper.The concept of causality is the basis of natural science. The natural scientistis convinced that the question “why” is a legitimate one…However, the content ofthe exact sciences is much more impoverished. In the precise sciences, thelegitimate question is only “how?”: i.e., in what manner a given chain ofoccurrences takes place. Therefore, the precise sciences are descriptive. Thisdescription is made in a 4-dimensional world, which signifies the possibility ofpredicting events. This possibility of prediction is the key to the power of theprecise sciences.299 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-299]This short excerpt again belies the significance of what Kozyrev is actuallysaying by making the distinction between the natural sciences on the one hand,and the precise or exact sciences on the other.2. A THEOLOGICAL ASIDEWith this distinction, Kozyrev has, in a way, revived a notion that was commoncurrency in Western science prior to Descartes, and even more importantly,reached deeply back into the theologico-cultural past of Eastern OrthodoxRussia. By the “exact” or “precise” sciences, Kozyrev means precisely what oneordinarily thinks of when one thinks of sciences such as physics or chemistry,and to some extent, genetics and biology. But what does he mean by “naturalsciences”? And how does this relate to his conception of the non-scalarity andnon-passivity of time?The key to the answer to these questions may in fact lie in the work of animportant seventh-century Byzantine Greek saint, Maximus the Confessor, a ChurchFather as important to the Orthodox Catholic East as Augustine of Hippo is tothe Roman Catholic and Protestant West.Briefly put, Maximus taught a basic “triadic structure” to cosmic history.Everything:1. began, that is, came to be from a state of non-being; everything transitionedfrom non-being to becoming. Thus, “becoming” was the very essence of createdbeing. This stage he called, aptly enough, Genesis, or “beginning (Γενεσις);2. moves, that is, as a being whose nature is becoming, creatures have aninherent dynamism or motion, which he calls by the stage Kinesis, from the Greekword κινησις, meaning motion;3. comes to a state of rest, or to an end, which he calls alternatively by theGreek words for rest — which is Stasis(στασις), where motion (of a particularkind) ceases — or by the word for “end” or “goal,” Telos (Τελος).Looking closely at the second stage, Kinesis, or motion, one perceives the linkto Kozyrev’s conceptual world, for in the patristic tradition of EasternOrthodoxy, which suffuses Russian culture at a very deep level, time itself wasunderstood to be a creature. Thus, time is an inherent and active property ofmotion, of physical processes, and not merely a passive, non-dimensional ormono-dimensional backdrop for such processes.Consequently, while Kozyrev does not — to my knowledge — ever explicitly referto such patristic theological conceptions, he nonetheless invokes some of itsconsequences in his own work. Moreover, it would be difficult to imagine such ahighly educated and literate Russian of great intellectual subtlety andrefinement, such as Kozyrev, being unfamiliar with the general outlines of suchthought and its implications, even in the officially atheistic Soviet Union. Byeven suggesting such a mediaeval notion as “natural sciences” asking thequestion not of “how?” but of “why?” he is in fact invoking an old notion of theend or goal of a physical process, a notion popularly known as teleology, fromthe very same word by which Maximus and others referred to the “end stage” ofcreation: Telos. This Kozyrev refers to by his penetrating insight that withoutan understanding of time as an active force within, rather than as a backdropto, physical processes, then perforce one has lost the ability to formallydistinguish between cause and effect.One of Kozyrev’s modern interpreters, himself a Russian, understands the fullimplications of what Kozyrev’s program entailed:…when the number of facts in favor of existing of the so-called “fifth force”grows, when we fail to register gravitational waves and solar neutrinos aredifficult to pick up in the necessary quantity, when the definitions of life,consciousness, free will are absent in physics and an essential definition oftime was not formulated, when even a consistent theory of the electron was notcreated, (any) statement on the completeness of theoretical physics looks lessconvincing…300 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-300]In other words, the implications of Kozyrev’s philosophical approach to theprogram of experimental and theoretical physics was nothing less than “catholic”in its scope, for it touched not only upon the “full range” of physicalprocesses and of time itself as an active force within them, but also upon theintelligence and consciousness of their human observers.3. TIME AND KOZYREV’S FORMALLY EXPLICIT DEFINITIONS OF CAUSE AND EFFECTBut once again, what are the implications of this philosophical approach forQuantum Mechanics? In order to understand the answer to this question, one mustbear in mind one of its principal features: the Heisenberg UncertaintyPrinciple. Named after its discoverer and formulator, the famous Germanphysicist Werner Heisenberg, this principle states essentially that if onemeasures the position of an electron in an atom, one cannot measuresimultaneously its velocity, and if one measures its velocity, one cannotmeasure its position.As a consequence of this principle, it will be apparent that the mere act ofdetermining what is measured is, to that extent, also an act of causing certainthings to be. And this, of course, overturned all previous notions of physicalcausality, because reality to some extent was determined by the mere act ofmeasuring it. It is this counterintuitive notion of cause and effect thatKozyrev’s work addresses directly and head-on, for in quantum mechanics, sincethe act of measurement injected such notions of uncertainty into the physicalprocess, ordinary cause and effect relations came to be dependent upon massivenumbers of observations and statistical averages and probabilities.Here too, however, Kozyrev points out that the “scalarity of time” once againenters the conceptual framework and clouds the actual picture that quantummechanics, with its statistical probabilities, actually paints:(Even) in the statistical mechanics of an isolated system, under the mostprobable condition, the directivity of time will not exist. It is quite naturalthat in statistical mechanics, based on the conventional mechanics of a point,the directivity of time does not appear as a quality of time itself butoriginates only as a property of the state of the system. If the directivity oftime and other possible qualities are objective, they should enter the system ofelementary mechanics of isolated processes. However, the statisticalgeneralization of such mechanics can lead to a conclusion concerning theunattainability of equilibrium conditions. In reality, the directivity of timesignifies a pattern continuously existing in time, which, acting upon thematerial system, can cause it to transfer to an equilibrium state. Under such aconsideration, the events should occur not only in time, as in a certain arena,but also with the aid of time. Time becomes an active participant in theuniverse, eliminating the possibility of thermal death. Then, we can understandharmony of life and death, which we perceive as the essence of our world.Already, owing to these possibilities alone, one should carefully examine thequestion as to the manner in which the concept of the directivity of time or itspattern can be introduced into the mechanics of elementary processes.301[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-301]To put it differently, since Kozyrev views time as an active participant insystems, he views the systems of physical processes in a profoundly differentway from standard physical mechanics, in that for him they are (1) open systemsand (2) systems more or less far from equilibrium. More is involved, in otherwords, in the notions of cause and effect than the merely statisticalprobabilities of standard quantum mechanics.Since time is not, on Kozyrev’s view, merely a dimensionless scalar, this meansin turn that it can have, like a vector of force in ordinary mathematicalphysics, a direction, a movement from one point to another, or what he calls,“the directivity of time.” It is this non-scalar, almost vector-like qualitythat Kozyrev means when he states that time is in its own right a kind ofphysical force, hitherto not adequately understood by contemporary physics as anexact science, but once understood when in its infancy centuries ago as anatural science. On this more ancient “teleological” view, “causality is linkedin the closest way with the properties of time, specifically with the differencein the future and the past.”302[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-302]If that were all there were to Kozyrev’s philosophical and experimental program,however, one might with some justification dismiss him as a rather belatedrevival of Aristotle. It is here that Kozyrev distinguishes himself in nouncertain terms from the New Age dilettante or presumed reviver of “naturalscience” in a merely mediaeval sense, for he outlines his program with threebasic hypotheses that will guide him in the formal mathematical modeling neededto define Cause and Effect, Past and Future, with formal explicitness. “Wewill,” he states, “be guided by the following hypothesis”:I. Time possesses a quality, creating a difference in causes from effects, whichcan be evoked by directivity or pattern. This property determines the differencein the past from the future.The requirement for this hypothesis is indicated by the difficulties associatedwith the development of the Leibnitz idea concerning the definition of thedirectivity of time through the causal relationships. The profound studies by H.Reichenbach… indicate that one can never advance this idea strictly, withouttautology. Causality provides us with a concept of the existence of thedirectivity of time and concerning certain properties of this directivity; atthe same time, it does not constitute the essence of this phenomenon, but onlyits result.Let us now attempt, utilizing the simplest properties of causality, to provide aquantitative expression of hypothesis I. Proceeding from those circumstances inwhich: 1) cause is always outside of the body in which the result is realizedand 2) the result set in after the cause, we can formulate the next two axioms:II. Causes and results are always separated by space. Therefore, between theirappearance there exists an arbitrarily small, but not equaling zero, spatialdifference dx.III. Causes and results are separated in time. Therefore, between theirappearance there exists an arbitrarily small, but not equaling zero, timedifference dt of a fixed sign.303[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-303]Note two very intriguing things from this passage.First, Dr. Kozyrev refers very explicitly to the groundbreaking and painstakingresearch of Baron Reichenbach, a researcher well-known for his scientificexperiments involving “sensitives,” psychics, and what he called “Odinic”energy, or that we would now call the physical medium or aether, and itsrelationships to human consciousness and perceptions. This is the strongestpossible indicator that Kozyrev knew full well the wide-ranging implications ofhis approach not only for the conventional relativistic and quantum mechanicalprograms of physical analysis, but also as a possible basis to plumb the depthsof the physics of the paranormal.But note secondly the astonishingly simple mathematical formalism by which Dr.Kozyrev has defined the distinction of cause and effect: it is some function ofthe difference in space and time of a system.304[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-304] Lest the importance of thisobservation be lost, Kozyrev is actually implying that space and time themselvesmust be quantized. Without it, the notions of cause and effect, and thedirectivity of time, will be lost, and physics will become counterintuitive, asin fact it did in the early twentieth century with Relativity and QuantumMechanics.But what does quantization mean?We are all accustomed to thinking of space as an empty void, infinitelydivisible into ever smaller and smaller units, or infinitely multipliable intoever larger ones, without limit. The same with time: we are used to thinking ofit as having no smallest unit of measure, nor a largest one. They are acontinuum in the truest sense. But quantum mechanics changed all this with itsidea that there is a smallest possible measurable unit of physical force oraction — the Planck Constant — but what it did not do was go on to suggest thatthere was a smallest possible unit of time. However, with the idea of thequantization of space and time itself, we are closer not only to understandingKozyrev’s work but also the equally breathtaking work of a little-known Germanphysicist that we will encounter in part four. With this insight, Kozyrev issuggesting that space and time are quantizable, that they have their owninherent measurable structures, and thus, time cannot be simply a scalar,without a direction, an inert and passive dimensionless player on the physicalstage, without orientation or an active force on physical processes.Before proceeding with our examination of Kozyrev’s work, it is worth pausing totake note of developments within Russian physics after Kozyrev, developmentsthat were based upon it and that came to some astonishing conclusions of itsown:…In physics (the notion of causality) appears only in the form of the so-calledprinciple of causality. According to this principle, the Future cannot have anyinfluence on the past (taking into consideration the theory of relativity italso means the impossibility of motion of bodies with the speeds which exceedthe speed of light in vacuum). Thus, physics and the other exact sciences ignorethe major part of causality notion aspects. N.A. Kozyrev also failed toformulate an irrefragable physical definition of causality.Obviously the first strictly formalized definition of causality can be found inthe article by M.K. Arushabov and S.M. Korotaev and in following articles byS.M. Kortaev (member of the Institute of Earth Physics RAS...). Simply speaking,this definition is based on the comparison of conditional probability of events:If we take two events, then the effect is the event with the probability ofrealization higher than analogous probability for another event…. With thissecond event will be the cause.(Editor’s note: in first view it seems strange that probability of cause is lessthan probability of the effect.) Such definition appeared to be consistent withKozyrev’s axiomatics.305 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-305]In other words, one of the implications of Kozyrev’s work that was pursued byRussian physicists was Kozyrev’s distinction of cause and effect, which, uponstatistical analysis, indicated that effects were always of much higherprobability than causes, and this, of course, was the whole reason Kozyrev alsocalled his physics program by the name “causal mechanics,” for it indicated thepossibility of the engineerability of causes via the understanding of time andits spin orientation and role as an actual active participant in physicalprocesses.4. QUASI-QUANTIZED TIME-SPACE SPIN ORIENTATIONSThis consideration of the directivity of time, that it would have a definitevalue or sign, positive or negative, leads Kozyrev to one of his profoundestinsights when he considers the nature of mirror worlds.From the pseudo-scalar properties of the time pattern, there immediately followsthe basic theorem of causal mechanics:A world with an opposite time pattern is equivalent to our world, reflected in amirror.In a world reflected in a mirror, causality is retained. Therefore, in a worldwith an opposite time pattern the events should develop just as regularly as inour world. It is erroneous to think that, having run a movie film of our worldin a reverse direction, we would obtain a pattern of the world of an oppositetime direction. We can in no way formally change the sign in the timeintervals.306 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-306] This leads toa disruption of causality, i.e, to an absurdity, to a world which cannotexist.307 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-307]A complete change of sign in the expression δt to -δt thus does not mean a“backward running movie” version of time, but rather, time running with anopposite spin orientation.Thus, a “mirror world” isA world with an opposite time pattern, the heart in the vertebrates would belocated on the right, the shells of mollusks would be mainly turned leftward,and in protoplasm there would be observed an opposite qualitative inequality ofthe right and left molecules. It is possible that the specially formulatedbiological experiments will be able to prove directly that life actually usesthe time pattern as an additional source of energy.308[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-308]In other words, because of the directivity of time, its spin orientation, oneshould be able to experimentally verify whether or not changes in physicalsystems occur on the basis of the rotation of the system, and the overallgeometrical “context” in which the experiment is performed, i.e., on the basisof when it is performed.Moreover, we’ve already encountered something like this before, for recall thatthe alchemists’ alchemist, none other than Paracelsus, stressed over and overagain that timing was an essential component to a successful alchemicaloperation! Recall also that David Hudson, in attempting to unravel the mysteryof his anomalous material, discovered that some of its unique properties werethe direct consequence of its high-spin states. Moreover, he also discoveredthat the spiraling geometry of the DNA helix itself had some relation to theability of biological systems to transduce energy from somewhere.Kozyrev has not only said where, but how: in the spin orientation of thespiraling geometry of time itself:Time enters a system through the cause to the effect. The rotation alters thepossibility of this inflow, and, as a result, the time pattern can createadditional stresses in the system. These variations produce the time pattern.From this it follows that time has energy.309[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-309]With the statement “time has energy” and the implication that “the time patterncan create additional stresses in the system,” and actually “enter” a system,Kozyrev has signaled that his philosophical program has the ability to beexperimentally verified, and this, as they say, is where it gets reallyintriguing, and where the alchemical parallels multiply like rabbits.5. THE ALCHEMICAL IMPLICATIONBut before we go down that hole and visit that warren, one final point should bemade about the implications of Kozyrev’s work, lest it be missed. By statingthat time itself “enters a system,” Kozyrev is implying that time itself is the“transmutative materia prima or physical medium of the alchemists. In pointingout its dynamic torsional properties, Kozyrev has reinforced his view that “timeis not a scalar.” But in doing so, he has only deepened the mysteryconsiderably, for he has really pointed out that the alchemists, too, knew thissecret. After all, it was none other than Paracelsus — writing centuries beforeKozyrev, and summing up the long chain of alchemists who had stressed the samething before him in all the long centuries prior to the Renaissance — who wrote:“Since, then, our matter is our root for the white and the red, necessarily ourvessel must be so fashioned that the matter in it may be governed by theheavenly bodies. For invisible celestial influences and the impressions of thestars are in the very first degree necessary for the work....”310[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-310]Kozyrev. Paracelsus.It seems a bizarre and perhaps even surreal association to make.And yet, as we shall now see, there are even more peculiar parallel transportsto be made between Kozyrev’s modern physics work, and ancient and mediaevalalchemy…"},{"pageContent":"8OF GYROSCOPES, SPONGES, AND HYDROGEN BOMBS KOZYREV’S EXPERIMENTS AND WILCOCK’SANALOGIES018 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_018_r1.jpg]“Furthermore, Kozyrev proved decades ago that these fields travel at‘superluminal’ speeds, meaning that they far exceed the speed of light. If youcan have an impulse that moves directly through the ‘fabric of space-time’,travels at superluminal velocities and is separate from gravity andelectromagnetism, you have a significant breakthrough in physics — one thatdemands that a ‘physical vacuum’, ‘zero point energy’ or an ‘aether’ must reallyexist.”David Wilcock311 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-311] “Rotating systems exist within rotating systems, producing ever-changing fieldsof dynamic torsion. Consequently, time is not a scalar.”Thus might one summarize the more than three decades of careful experimentation,meticulous observation, a veritable mountain of data, and the penetratingconceptualization and analysis that Dr. Nikolai A. Kozyrev performed. In thefinal analysis, however, any attempt to summarize the prodigious decades’ effortof this Russian genius is doomed to failure. Here all that can be done is totrace the outlines of his thought as exemplified in some of his experiments, toexhibit its truly awesome implications, and its even stranger parallelisms withalchemy.In order to find our way through this vast labyrinth of data, and the even moresubtle labyrinth of Dr. Kozyrev’s mind, some sort of systematic analogy will behelpful. Fortunately, with the signally important work of researcher DavidWilcock, we have such an analogy ready to hand. More importantly, it is ananalogy that lends itself quite well to tracing out some of the more obscureimplications of Dr. Kozyrev’s work.A. OF SPONGES: DAVID WILCOCK’S ANALOGYIn an article in Nexus magazine summarizing his research into Dr. Kozyrev,author and alternative history and sciences researcher David Wilcock presents anextended analogy that we shall on occasion have recourse to in order to aid ourpresentation of Kozyrev’s work:In order to truly grasp Kozyrev’s work and related findings, certain newanalogies for physical matter are required. Kozyrev’s work forces us tovisualise [sic] all physical objects of matter in the Universe as if they aresponges submerged in water. In all these analogies, we should consider thesponges as having remained in water for a long enough period of time that theyare completely saturated. Bearing this in mind, there are two things we can dowith such sponges underwater: we can decrease the volume of water that theycontain or increase it by very simple mechanical procedures.1. Decrease: If a submerged, saturated sponge is squeezed, cooled or rotated,then some of the water inside of it will be released into its surroundings,decreasing its mass. Once the sponge is no longer disturbed, the pressure on themillions of tiny pores is relieved, causing it again to absorb water and expandback to its normal resting mass.2. Increase: We can also pump more water pressure into the sponge in its reststate, such as by heating (vibrating) it, thus causing some of the pores toexpand with more water than they can comfortably hold. In this case, once werelieve the added pressure, the sponge will naturally release its excess waterand shrink back down to its normal resting mass.Though it would seem impossible to most people, Kozyrev showed that by shaking,spinning, heating, cooling, vibrating or breaking physical objects, their weightcan be increased or decreased by subtle but definite amounts. And this is butone aspect of his amazing work.312[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-312]Wilcock’s analogy is very carefully chosen, and it is worth pausing to considerits own unique set of alchemical parallels.1. SUBMERGED SPONGES, SUB-SPACES AND HYPER-SPACES: AN ALCHEMICAL PARALLELWilcock’s analogy of sponges representing physical objects submerged in water isa very apt one, for as representing the manifold systems of the physicaluniverse — from spinning spiraling galaxies, rotating masses of stars andplanets and pulsars to molecules and atoms and sub-atomic particles — submergedin water, Wilcock is implying that our ordinary space-time is a subset of a muchlarger, hyper-dimensional “space-time,” or alternatively, he is proposing a viewof space-time in which hyper-spaces and sub-spaces all contribute to theformation of our physical universe. In this, as we shall see, he is adequatelyrepresenting the actual thought and implications not only of Kozyrev’s work,but, as we shall also discover in part four, the even more breathtaking work andthought of a little-known German physicist.But in so doing, Wilcock is also pointing out another aspect of Kozyrev’s workthat is not without its own unique alchemical parallels, for if time, onKozyrev’s view, is not simply a scalar, but has qualities and dynamic propertiescapable of its own “multi-dimensional” descriptions, then one is reminded ofesotericist Manly P. Hall’s statement about alchemical operations having to beperformed in more than one world simultaneously, by a common operation andcommon “recipe”:As one of the great alchemists fittingly observed, man’s quest for gold is oftenhis undoing, for he mistakes the alchemical processes, believing them to bepurely material. He does not realize that the Philosopher’s Gold, thePhilosopher’s Stone, and the Philosopher’s Medicine exist in each of the fourworlds and that the consummation of the experiment cannot be realized until itis successfully carried on in four worlds simultaneously according to oneformula.313 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-313]Such processes, as Hall notes, are not simply nor “purely material,” implyingthat there are immaterial, i.e., hyper-dimensional, properties at work, and thatthe Philosophers’ Stone itself is an object partly inhabiting thisworld-dimension, and partly inhabiting other worlds and dimensions.2. SPINNING, VIBRATING, HEATING, COOLING: ANOTHER ALCHEMICAL PARALLELThere is another signally important point in Wilcock’s analogical summary ofKozyrev’s work, and that is the “list of processes” that Kozyrev employed in hisexperiments: spinning, vibrating, heating, and cooling (among many others). Thistoo sounds oddly familiar, not only recalling the processes employed by DavidHudson, but as was seen from part one, the alchemists’ recipes themselves.To put it succinctly, not only do Kozyrev’s views on the dynamic and qualitativeproperties of time and its non-scalarity parallel to an astonishing degree theviews of the alchemists, but the parallels may be pressed to an even moredetailed level, for the alchemists too subjected various materials to a varietyof such physical stresses in their alchemical operations, and like thealchemists and David Hudson, Kozyrev is also noticing strange mass losses andgains when materials are subjected to a variety of physical stresses.B. OF GYROSCOPES AND OTHER THINGS: THE EXPERIMENTAL WORLD OF DR. KOZYREVAs seen in the previous chapter, Kozyrev posited that time was actually ameasurable physical force with properties of its own, manifest in the spiralingpatterns one finds in nature from shellfish to DNA. Seizing on the principalfeature of torsion — the rotation and spin orientation of a system — Kozyrevformulated a series of initial basic experiments to test and confirm histheoretical conceptions.“The theoretical concepts indicate,” he writes, “that the tests on the study ofcausal relationships and the pattern of time need to be conducted with rotatingbodies: namely, gyroscopes. The first tests were made in order to verify thatthe law of conservation of a pulse is always fulfilled, and independently of thecondition of rotating bodies.”314[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-314] With this observation, Dr.Kozyrev set up various experiments involving gyroscopes.1. THE SIMPLE GYROSCOPE EXPERIMENTS AND THEIR BREATHTAKING RESULTSThese gyroscope experiments were simplicity itself, and it is best to cite Dr.Kozyrev’s own descriptions of the experimental apparatus to see how incrediblysimple these actually were:These tests were conducted on lever-type weights (scales). At a deceleration ofthe gyroscope, rotating by inertia, its moment of rotation should be imparted tothe weights (scales), causing an inevitable torsion of the suspensions.315[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-315]The experiments, in other words, were deliberately designed to test the presenceof torsion. Kozyrev continues:In order to avert the suspension difficulties associated with this, the rotationof the gyroscope should be held constant. Therefore, we utilized gyroscopes fromaviation automation, the velocity of which was controlled by a variable 3-phasecurrent with a frequency of the order of 500 (cycles per second). Thegyroscope’s rotor turned with this same frequency….During the suspension thegyroscope was installed in a hermetically sealed box, which excluded completelythe effect of air currents. The accuracy of this suspension was of the order of(0.1 to 0.2 milligrams). With a vertical arrangement of the axis and variousrotation velocities, the readings of the weights (scales) remained unchanged.316[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-316]But then comes an astonishing admission:The test was conducted for various directions of suspension and rotation massesof the gyroscope, at different amplitudes, and at an oscillation frequencyranging from units to hundreds of (cycles per second). For a rotating gyroscope,just as for a stationary one, the readings of the weights (scales) remainedunchanged. We can consider that the experiments described substantiate fairlywell the theoretical conclusion concerning the conservation of a pulse in causalmechanics. In spite of their theoretical interest, the previous experiments didnot yield any new effects capable of confirming the role of causality inmechanics.317 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-317]If that had been all there was to it, however, Kozyrev probably would have donewhat any other scientist would have done: packed it in, admitted he was wrong,and gone on to other things.But Kozyrev was no average scientist. For the experiments did do somethinghighly unusual. The gyroscopes were, it will be recalled, suspended from a levelbalance scale, and thus were but only thinly connected with these finelycalibrated balance scales which measured them. It is here the anomaly appeared:However, in their fulfillment it was noted that in the transmission of thevibrations from the gyroscope to the support of the weights (scales) variationsin the readings of the weights (scales) can appear, depending on the velocityand direction of rotation of the gyroscopes. When the vibrations of the weights(scales) themselves begin, the box with the gyroscope discontinues beingstrictly a closed system.318[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-318]This was the first of many breakthroughs and anomalies that Kozryev’sexperiments would uncover.2. TIME IMPARTS A SPIN ORIENTATION TO THE TOTAL SYSTEMNote that one aspect of Kozyrev’s basic theoretical conception was in factconfirmed, namely, that the local space of a system itself appeared to have aspin orientation; it was not simply a “void with a curvature,” as thepost-Einstein popular imagination would have it, but it was a space with adynamic property: an orientation to rotation. Additionally, as Kozyrev alsonoted, the system began to acquire this characteristic when the gyroscope andthe scales ceased being closed systems in themselves, and became open to eachother.Kozyrev makes these points very clearly in an astonishing series of statements:With a certain type of vibration, which was chosen completely by feel, thereoccurred a considerable decrease in the effect of the gyroscope upon the weights(scales) during its rotation in a counterclockwise direction, if we examined itfrom above. During the rotation in a clockwise direction, under the sameconditions, the readings of the weights (scales) remained practically unchanged.Measurements conducted with gyroscopes of varying weight and rotor radius, atvarious angular velocities, indicated that a reduction of the weight…is actuallyproportional to the weight and to the linear rate of rotation. For example, at arotation of the gyroscope (D=4.6cm, Q= 90 grams, u=25 meters per second), weobtained the weight difference of -8 (milligrams). With rotation in a clockwisedirection, it always turned out that (the weight difference) = 0. However, witha horizontal arrangement of the axis (of rotation of the gyroscope), in azimuth,we found the average value = -4 milligrams. From this, we can conclude that anyvibrating body under the conditions of this experiment should indicate areduction in weight. Further studies demonstrated that this effect is caused bythe rotation of the earth, which will be discussed in detail later. Presently,the only fact of importance to us is that during the vibration there isdeveloped a new zero reading relative to which with a rotation in acounterclockwise direction, we obtain a weight reduction, while during arotation in a clockwise direction we obtain a weight reduction, while duringrotation in a clockwise direction we obtain a completely uniform increase inweight (± 4 milligrams).319 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-319]Kozyrev leaves nothing to chance and spells out the implications of theseobservations and experimental data quite clearly: “Hence, time possesses notonly energy but also a rotation moment which it can transmit to a system.”320[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-320] With this, of course, oneperceives an immediate connection to the Nazi Bell experiment, with its ownrotating system and persistent allegations of time distortions andexperimentation being explored in the Third Reich. And of course, once again,with this stunning conclusion, Kozyrev has also implied that the ancientalchemical observations that operational results varied with time have a basisnot in mediaeval flights of fancy, but in real experimental science.3. THE “INTENSITY OF TIME” AND SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTSSince time possesses these dynamic qualities, one may conclude that it can havea certain “density,” i.e., that it can compress or rarefy; once again, time is“not a scalar” on Dr. Kozyrev’s view. Indeed, he himself puts the case in somany words:In the case of time, there also exists a variable property which can be calledthe density of intensity of time. In a case of low density it is difficult fortime to influence the material systems, and there is required an intensiveemphasis of the causal-resultant relationship in order that the force caused bythe time pattern would appear. It is possible that our psychological sensationof empty or substantive time has not only a subjective nature but also,similarly to the sensation of the flow of time, an objective physical basis.321[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-321]Note that what Dr. Kozyrev is calling “the time pattern” means precisely thedegree of spiraling, folding, and pleating that enters a system due to theamount of torsion it is experiencing, and that this may indeed be the actualphysical basis for why people experience the flow of time now more, and nowless, “quickly” under certain conditions.All this leads to the inevitable conclusion that his experiments involvinggyroscopes, pendulums and various compounds would themselves vary according tothe local celestial geometries and the amount of torsion his experimentstransduced. This indeed was what Kozyrev found:Evidently many circumstances exist affecting the density of time in the spacesurrounding us. In late autumn and in the first half of winter all of the testscan be easily managed. However, in summer these experiments become difficult tosuch an extent that many of them could not be completed. Obviously, the densityof time changes within broad limits, owing to the processes occurring in nature,and our tests utilize a unique instrument to record these changes.322[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-322]However, confirming this “alchemical insight” was not enough for Kozyrev. Heimmediately continued by formulating the theoretical possibility of alchemyitself:If this be so, it proves possible to have one material influence another throughtime. Such a relationship could be foreseen, since the causal-resultantphenomena occurred not only in time but also with the aid of time. Therefore, ineach process of nature time can be extended or formed. These conclusions couldbe confirmed by a direct experiment.323[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-323]But in what way is this statement alchemical? After all, Kozyrev does notmention the term “alchemy” itself, nor does it appear that it was in his mind.The answer, once again, is rather simple. Recall that torsion is ahigher-dimensional entity; that its “space” encompasses that normal space-timeof ordinary physical reality. To recall Wickock’s analogy once again, it is thehyper-dimensional water in which the sponge of this world is submerged. Thus, bymeans of the “pattern of time” impressed in an object, “it proves possible tohave one material influence another through time,” that is, by means of it.Kozyrev has once again come to the same basic insight and agreement with thealchemists: taking note of the proper time is an essential component in theconfection of the Philosophers’ Stone, for time itself is an essential qualityof the materia prima, of the Philosophers’ Stone itself.As if that were not enough, it should be noted how often in the previously citedquotations that Dr. Kozyrev mentioned the “causal-resultant” relationship, orphenomenon. By stating that having “one material influence another through time”could be “confirmed by a direct experiment,” Kozyrev has signaled the fact thathe believes the cause-effect relationship could be deterministically engineered,and thus, Kozyrev ceases speaking of the “causal-resultant” relationship, andstarts to defer to it as “the causal-resultant dipole.”4. THE “CAUSE-EFFECT DIPOLE,” TORSION, “PRE-ACTION” AND SUPERLUMINAL INFORMATIONTRANSFERBut what is a “dipole” and what is the significance of Kozyrev’s deliberate andcarefully chosen change of language in its regard?A dipole is best illustrated by what everyone knows about magnets andelectricity, for both are dipolar phenomena: magnets of course have two poles, a“north” and a “south” pole, which give rise to the magnetic field that “moves”between them. Electricity, similarly, has a dipolar nature, since electricitymoves between a positive and negative polarity or charge, or, if one prefersmore generalized engineering terms, between a power source and its load end. Inturn, these dipolar phenomena are a result of fundamental broken symmetries, ofa non-equilibrium condition, a stress, within the system itself. They are twomutually important aspects of a common underlying reality without which thosephysical forces and phenomena simply would not exist.Consequently, by stating the cause-effect relationship in terms of a dipole,Kozyrev was stating that this, too, is a broken symmetry, and that bothcomponents were essential conditions to physical action, and moreover, that theycould be engineered and in some cases, their roles could be reversed by changingthe physical and geometrical parameters and relationships within an experimentalsystem.He states all this by outlining a series of experiments performed with pendulumsand electric motors:Since we are studying the phenomenon of such a generality as time, it is evidentthat it is sufficient to take the simplest mechanical process in order toattempt to change the density of time. For example, using any motor, we canraise and lower a weight or change the tension of a tight elastic band. Weobtain a system with two poles, a source of energy and its outflow; i.e., thecausal-resultant dipole. With the aid of a rigid transmission, the pole of thisdipole can be separated for a fairly extensive distance. We will bring one ofthese poles close to a long pendulum during the vibrations of its point ofsuspension. It is necessary to tune the vibrations in such a way that the fulleffect of southward deflection would not develop, but only the tendency for theappearance of this effect. It turned out that this tendency increasesappreciably and converts even to the complete effect if we being near to thebody of the pendulum or to the suspension point that pole of the dipole wherethe absorption of energy is taking place. However, with the approach of theother pole (of the motor), the appearance of the effect of the southerndeflection in the pendulum invariably became difficult. In the case of a closejuxtaposition of the poles of the dipole, their influence on the pendulumpractically disappeared. It is evident that in this case a considerablecompensation of their effects occurs. It turned out that the effect of thecausal pole does not depend on the direction along which it is installedrelative to the pendulum. Its effect depends only on the distance (spacing).Repeated and careful measurements demonstrated that this effect diminishes, notinversely proportional to the square of the distance, as in the case of forcefields, but inversely proportional to the first power of the distance. Inraising and lowering of a 10-kg weight suspended through a unit distance, itsinfluence was sensed at a distance of 2–3 meters from the pendulum. Even thethick wall of the laboratory did not shield this effect….The results obtained indicate that nearer the system with the causal-resultantrelationship the density of time actually changes. Near the motor there occurs athinning (rarefaction of time), while near the energy receiver its compactiontakes place. The impression is gained that time is extended by a cause and,contrariwise, it becomes more advanced in that place where the effect islocated.324 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-324]In other words, the behavior of the pendulum would vary according to which partof the dipole, the cause (the motor) or the effect (the load end), were broughtinto proximity with the point of suspension of the pendulum, or to the outermostpoint of its swing.That time itself would gate energy into the system of the pendulum depending onthe geometrical arrangement of the power-load end dipole in connection with it,led Kozyrev to formulate a bold conclusion, one which tied his experimentalobservations directly into the non-local nature of the underlying materia prima,time, itself:The tests proved the existence of the effects through time of one materialsystem upon another. This effect does not transmit a pulse (momentum), meaningit does not propagate but appears simultaneously in any material system. In thismanner, in principle it proves possible to have a momentary relationship and amomentary transmission of information. Time accomplishes a relationship betweenall phenomena of nature and participates actively in them.325[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-325]By the “momentary” appearance of an effect from one isolated system in anotherisolated system, Kozyrev means that the affect is transmitted, via the non-localmedium — the “water in which they are submerged” — at faster-than-lightvelocities.5. KOZYREV’S “TORSION TELESCOPE”Time, torsion, thus constituted a kind of “pre-action” determinant on systems.It was itself an energy traveling at much greater than light velocities.According to one Russian researcher into his ideas, in order to test this newidea, namely, that one could detect future action, Kozyrev constructed a“torsion detector telescope:”From the mid-50s to the late 70s, professor N.A. Kozyrev (with V.V. Nasonov)conducted astronomical observations using a receiving system of a new type. Whenthe telescope was directed at a certain star, the detector (designed by N.A.Kozyrev and V.V. Nasonov) positioned within the telescope registered theincoming signal even if the main mirror of the telescope was shielded by metalscreens. This fact indicated that electromagnetic waves (light) had somecomponent that could not be shielded by metal screens.326[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-326] When the telescope wasdirected not at the visible but at the true position of a star, the detectorthen registered an incoming signal that was much stronger. The registration ofthe true positions of different stars could be interpreted only as aregistration of star radiation that had velocities billions of times greaterthan the speed of light. N.A. Kozyrev also found that the detector registered anincoming signal when the telescope was directed at a position symmetrical to thevisible position of a star relative to its true position. This fact wasinterpreted as a detection of the future positions of stars.327[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-327]This astronomical “pre-action” was also reflected in their laboratoryexperiments as well. As Kozyrev’s assistant of many years, V.V. Nasonov noted,“Already in the torsion-balance experiments it was repeatedly noticed that, atoptimum experimental conditions, a small deflection of the system readings,directed oppositely to the expected effect, appeared prior to the action.”328[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-328]A. KOZYREV’S PROGENY AND THE REVERSE ENGINEERING OF TIME: THE ALLEGED RUSSIAN“SCALAR SPHERES”If the cause-effect dipole and time itself could to some extent be engineeredand even reversed, as was implied in Kozyrev’s pendulum experiments, then thepossibility of an even more breathtaking engineering occurs. But thispossibility is not without its critics as we shall see.But first, the allegation itself:In a paper entitled “Time and Its Physical Relationships,” Andrew Michrowskinotes one of the possibilities Kozyrev opened in the Pandora’s Box of his causalmechanics:In preventive time engineering, one could delay the approach of a known causeand to artificially close the consequence loop, and thereby annulling it fromever achieving an effect. In other words, one can make the effect “happen”before its normal time, disrupting space structure with its related “speed ofthe course of time.” One can also make it “happen” after its expected deadline.This technology could have interesting implication in strategic situations(preventing an extra-planetary body from attaining a collision course).According to the Russian experience, when the spatial structure is disrupted bytime-engineered causal mechanics, the affected region undergoes relative greaterentropy (or less order). The volume of space if forced out to somewhere else,generating torsion fields...329[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-329]And this, according to Michrowski, led to actual Russian experiments with timemachines in the 1990s, curiously, in the same time frame as the emergence of thewhole “Red Mercury” nuclear terrorism scare of the same period:For over 15 years, a Russian association of scientists has conducted experimentswith acceleration and deceleration of time with 4 prototypes of time machines.Light-heartedly, the units are called “muskrat traps” since the experimentsconducted in remote forests were disguised as a high-tech electromagnetictechnology for trapping muskrats. The time machine units are sphere ranging indiameters of 30cm, 1 meter, and 2.1 meters. The shells are encased with coilsdesigned to produce convergent waves. Team leader Vadim A. Chernobrov describesconverging electromagnetic waves as moving from a periphery to a central point.They are observed when a hoop is thrown into the water and inside the hoop thewaves converge. If a potential is applied to do work and to initiate the energydifferential process, the other reverse direction scalar (the reverse-timeenergy flow) must react. Thus, compensation of time — in the form of thedeceleration or acceleration of the rate of time — can take place.The first trials involved mice, in which most (25 out of 31) died. Eventuallythere were successful 2-hours runs of time travel. An experiment with a dog thatwas clearly frightened also showed no ill effects. This led to experimentationwith humans, the first being Ivan Konov who, on August 26, 2001, deceleratedinto the past by 3% of planetary time during a half-hour trial. Dozens of othershave experienced the phenomenon and report such sensations as: quicker pulse,giddiness, itching skin, body twisting, numbness at extremities and a case of anout-of-body experience. Harmful effects on living systems do not appear to belinked to the change of the rate of time, but rather to the variations of thetime rate value among regions of a living organism.330[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-330]There is something strange about this list, for we’ve seen it before:Readers of my previous books, Reich of the Black Sun and The SS Brotherhood ofthe Bell, will recall that some of the effects of the Nazi Bell, when inoperation, produced similar results: a pricking sensation in the skin, or an“itching” sensation, giddiness and muscular effects. Other effects were noted inobservers outside of the apparati, including headaches.331[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-331]The question, as we shall see below, is not over whether such strange apparatiwere ever constructed or tested, but rather, whether or not they and the testsrepresent real science, or, as some within Russia are now charging,pseudo-science.B. TORSION, SYSTEM MEMORY, AND PSYCHOMETRYThe charge indeed has its roots in some aspects of Kozyrev’s own thought, sobefore investigating the charges, it is essential to understand thephilosophical and conceptual soil in his thought from whence the science, orpseudo-science, sprang.One of Kozyrev’s most crucial observations in the formulation of his approachwas that the prized Second Law of Thermodynamics in physics does not, inactuality, square with any observed phenomena of nature:Kozyrev pointed out the sharp contradiction between the second law ofthermodynamics which brings nearer the thermal death of the Universe, and theabsence of any signs of equilibrium in the diversity of the Universe. Hestressed that “the attempts to explain the absence of thermal death have beenquite apart from the real Universe observed by astronomers. The point is thatthe celestial bodies and their systems are so well isolated from each other thattheir thermal death must have occurred much sooner than any external systemcould interfere. Therefore degraded states of systems ought to dominate, whereasthey are almost never met. And the task is not only to explain thenon-equilibrium state of the whole Universe, but also to gain an understandingwhy separate systems and celestial bodies themselves continue to live despitethe short relaxation times.”Various hypotheses are possible attempting to “save” the second law ofthermodynamics. For instance, the one asserting that the Universe is isolatedindeed but the present moment of cosmological time is not very far from the“initial” fluctuation (singularity, cataclysm), so that the signs of degradationcannot be too clear, i.e., the “death” is postponed to a remote future. N.A.Kozyrev suggested an alternative version: the Universe and its subsystems arenot isolated, i.e., the necessary condition for the second law of thermodynamicsis not valid: “there are permanently acting causes in nature, preventing entropyincrease.” A necessary factor, violating the isolated state of systems, is justthe Kozyrev flow (of time).332[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-332]Entropy is not observed, nor is any heat death observed in the Universe, on alarge scale, simply because of the fact that time and torsion actually interfacewhat otherwise are apparently isolated systems. It is the very fact that suchlarge-scale entropy is not observed in the Universe that indicates for Kozyrevthat such linkage must be the case.And it is this, precisely, that gives rise to the “paranormal possibility” withall the allegations of “pseudo-science” that this implies, for as has been seen,torsion not only can but does affect the transfer of information from one systemto another at greater than light velocities, and by its means, one system canimpress itself on another. Materials can “influence” each other through time, torecall Kozyrev’s own words. Torsion induces a stable “system memory” than canimpress itself from one system to another.For the budding esotericist, this was a conceptual basis within formal physicsconsiderations not only for the possibility that actual memories could beimpressed into physical objects — a cconcept known as psychometry — but alsothat there may indeed be a real physics basis for that most hated of all thepseudo-sciences: astrology, with all its lore of the influences of celestialgeometries on personality.This was, in fact, one of the results of Kozyrev’s actual experiments, for as hehimself stated, “A body placed for a certain time near a process and thenbrought to a torsion balance, produced the same effect on them as the processitself. Memorizing the action of processes is a feature of different substances,except aluminum.”333 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-333] Notethe huge implications of Kozyrev’s remarks, for they imply that so vast andthorough was his experimentation into various materials, that some were found tobe torsion process memory preservers, while aluminum was discovered to shieldagainst it! He had, in other words, through his experiments assembled a largecatalogue of the torsion-amplifying or damping properties of various elementsand compounds.334 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-334] And theseproperties in turn are a result of their lattice structure, a fact that willcome to have even more significance in the next part of this book.C. PECULIAR PARALLELS: QUANTIZED RESULTSOne of the most significant results that Kozyrev obtained in his variousexperiments involving balances was the fact that the weight gains and losseswere quantized, i.e., they occurred in discrete steps or increments, and werenot continuous and smooth:In the vibration experiments on a balance the weight reduction ∆Q occursstepwise, beginning with a certain vibration power. As vibration frequency isfurther increased, the weight reduction ∆Q at first remains the same and thenagain grows stepwise by the same value. Thus it has been observed that, apartfrom the basic step ∆Q, good harmonic oscillations make it possible to see aseries of quantized values: ∆Q/2, ∆Q, 2∆Q, 3∆Q…, corresponding to continuousvibration frequency increase…. So far a realistic explanation of this phenomenonhas not been found….Similar quantum effects have been observed with pendulums.Afterwards it turned out that effect quantization takes place in almost all theexperiments.335 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-335]In a rare lapse for Kozyrev, he seems to have missed what his own results,coupled with his previous insights concerning the nature of time and its torsioneffects, implies, namely, if these quantized steps are manifestations of thenature of time, then this would seem to imply that space-time itself has aquantized structure, and is not a smooth infinitely divisible continuum. As willbe seen in the next part of this book, this crucial insight forms the basis of abreathtaking theory by one of Germany’s most brilliant and least-knownphysicists.Before continuing, it is necessary to pause and consider the two basic featuresand implications of Kozyrev’s experiments:1. Time and space are quantized and not continuous; and,2. Experimental operations vary in their results dependent upon the season theyare performed, i.e., depending on the ever-changing local geometry of space andtime.These two results recall the work of yet another physicist, working across theocean, in America, and finding some very similar results.(1) QUANTIZED RESULTS AND THE GRAVITOR EXPERIMENTS OF THOMAS TOWNSEND BROWNThat physicist is Thomas Townsend Brown, well-known in alternative literature tohave been allegedly involved in the Philadelphia Experiment,336[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-336] and even more well knownfor his experiments in “electro-gravity” and a device which he called a“gravitator.” These were dielectric blocks suspended from a roof, like apendulum, and charged to high electrical potential. When this happened, thedevices would lose mass, and actually lift, tilting upward. But moreimportantly, Brown observed that the devices would regain mass, and return totheir starting position, in a series of discrete quantized steps, rather thanfloat smoothly back down into their starting position. Moreover, Brown, likeKozyrev, also observed that the effect and the efficiency of his device variedwith the seasons of the year and the phases of the Moon. In other words, Brown,like Kozyrev, had experimentally implied the quantization of space and time,since the results varied with the local celestial and ever-changing geometry.337[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-337](2) QUANTIZED RESULTS AND THE ALCHEMISTSEven more peculiarly, Kozyrev’s work, with its discovery of the time-varying andquantized results of torsion experiments, not only echoes the observations ofthe alchemists that alchemical operations had to be performed at certain times,but also recalls their own suggestions that the results of their operations werequantized.Consider only the implications of the following quotation from the mediaevalalchemist Roger Bacon, whom we have already encountered:The second multiplication is an Augmentum quantitatis of the stone with itsformer power, in such a way that it neither loses any of its power, nor gainsany, but in such a manner that its weight increases and keeps on increasing evermore, so that a single ounce grows and increases to many ounces. To achieve thisincrease or Multiplication one has to proceed in the following manner: Take inthe Name of God, your stone, and grind it to a subtle powder, and add as muchMercurii Solis as was taught before. Put these into a round vial, seal withsigillo Hermetis, and put it into the former oven exactly as taught, except thatthe time has to be shorter and less now. Whereas before you previously used ten(alii thirty) days, you may now not use more than four (alii ten) days.338[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-338]Note the typically ambiguous alchemical language, for the implication ofquantization is both clear, yet vague, in the reference to “multiplication.”Moreover, note as well the role which time plays in the operation.An even more suggestive hint that alchemists also observed some sort ofquantization in the results of their operations is made even clearer in thefollowing quotation from Paracelsus:No precise weight can be assigned in this work of projection, though thetincture itself may be extracted from a certain subject, in a definedproportion, and with fitting appliances. For instance, that Medicine tingessometimes thirty, forty, occasionally even sixty, eighty, or a hundred parts ofthe imperfect metal.339 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-339]Why Paracelsus is careful to elaborate the projection in terms of multiples often — thirty, forty, sixty, eighty, or a hundred — and does not mention fifty,seventy, or ninety, is very suggestive that he has possibly observed quantizedeffects in his alchemical operations. And of course, no one stressed the neednot only for attention to, but the embodiment of, temporal geometries, of timeitself, in the alchemical apprati and operations.(3) TORSION, SYSTEM MEMORY, CRYSTAL GROWTH AND DEFECTS: A PHILOSOPHERS’ STONE INTHE DESERT OF EGYPTThere is yet another strange parallel, and to see how strange a parallel it is,one must refer to two statements made by some of Kozyrev’s progeny. In a ratherinnocent-sounding paper entitled “Experimental Detection of the Torsion Field,”Yuri V. Nachalov and E.A. Parkhomov make the following observation:If any substance (or even the physical vacuum in general) is subjected to theinfluence of an external torsion field, then this influence causes a transversespin polarization of that substance. Since this transverse spin polarization canbe retained as a metastable state, then a torsion field of a given spatialconfiguration can be “recorded” upon any physical object.340[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-340]We have encountered this before, as the phenomenon of “psychometry.”But these authors have a specific substance in mind: “Torsion fields are able tochange the rate of any physical process, for instance, they significantly alterthe oscillation frequency of quartz crystals.”341[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-341] If this be true, then it islikewise possibly equally true that torsion fields also affect the very growthof such crystals themselves, and thus, the standard defects of lattice structurethat one finds in crystals are the result of their growth patterns and defectsrecording the torsion fields to which they are subjected when grown. Indeed, thetorsion tensor itself is capable of describing such lattice defects!And this brings us to the veritable “Philosophers’ Stone in the EgyptianDesert,” the Great Pyramid of Giza, for in my book The Giza Death StarDestroyed, I suggested precisely this torsion and hyper-dimensional basis forthe placement of the interior chambers of the structure:Very obviously, the Great Pyramid is itself a crystal, composed of innumerableamounts of smaller crystals of quartz embedded in its limestone and granite.That is, if one wishes to couple a harmonic oscillator to the medium itself, andif this medium be a kind of “crystal”…then the most logical choice for anefficient oscillator of such a medium would be to … give it an overallcrystalline structure, right down to the “defects” all crystals possess.342[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-342]I then elaborated on the idea in the footnote:I am suggesting, in other words, that the placement of the inner chambers insidethe Great Pyramid may not be accidental, but deliberately designed… defects,since the energy needed to produce such defects is precisely calculable…. Ofcourse, to suggest that the interior chambers of the Pyramid might be preciselyplaced, and have some function of coupled oscillation of the medium derivingfrom their placement, is an extremely speculative suggestion...343[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-343]In other words, the placement of the interior chambers may ultimately prove tobe based on a precise knowledge of torsion fields in the local celestial system,on a precise knowledge of the nature and physical properties of time itself.344[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-344]D. THE CHARGE OF PSEUDO-SCIENCE: CURIOUS ECHOES OF THE “RED MERCURY” STORYIntriguing and suggestive as all these parallels are, however, it is in theparallel of the more recent attacks on Kozyrev and his progeny as“pseudo-science” coming from within Russia itself that one encounters the mostpeculiar parallel of them all: the resemblance of the attacks to similarattempts to denounce “Red Mercury” as a hoax that also emanated from withinRussia, during the same time period. The first attacks began, in fact, in 1959with a series of articles in Pravda, and hence Kozyrev’s work had to waitseveral years before publication.345[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-345] Notably, this attack occursin more or less the same time period that Soviet Russia ceased open discussionand publication of its work in producing “pure fusion bombs,” a connection wewill explore more fully in a moment. With the fall of the Soviet Union, a seriesof virulent attacks began to appear in the Russian press denouncing thosepursuing the lines of research implied by Kozyrev’s work as being“pseudo-scientists.” While it is probably true that much of this was indeed thecase, with charlatans capitalizing on the confusion of the times to gain fundingfrom the Russian government for their fraudulent projects, the possibility thatit was also an attempt to cast a pall of suspicion over the whole legitimatedevelopment of “causal mechanics” in Kozyrev’s hands must also be entertained,for his work, at that point, was no longer a secret.However, the question is: Why would the Russian government possibly have beentrying to cast a pall of suspicion over Kozyrev’s work?To answer that, we must turn once again to the Red Mercury legend of the early1990s, a legend which the Russian press was equally at pains to denounce as ahoax and as “pseudo-science.”C. BACK TO “RED” MERCURY: OF HYDROGEN BOMBS, FAR-FROM-EQUILIBRIUM SYSTEMS ANDTORSIONAs has been noted, Kozyrev’s basic insight against the Second Law ofThermodynamics was simply that the Universe exhibited far too muchnon-equilibrium in order for it to be true in the sense most physicistsunderstood it to be. Indeed, at the very core of his theoretical edifice, theidea of systems far-from-equilibrium is paramount.346[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-346] And no systems could befarther from equilibrium than stars, and their man-made counterparts, hydrogenbombs.In fact, it will be recalled that the whole principal motivation, by his ownreckoning, for his decades’ long investigation of torsion, and of the torsionamplifying and shielding properties of various elements and compounds, wasprecisely the fact that there were simply not enough neutrinos being emitted bystars for the standard model of stars as gigantic perpetual fusion reactors —essentially perpetual hydrogen bombs — to be true.347[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-347]As a recent Russian commentator on Kozyrev’s work has noted,Long-term experiments by R. Davis on registration of solar neutrinos lead to aconclusion that the temperature of the central part of the Sun is lower than thetemperature, which is necessary to provide its radiance due to the thermonuclearreactions only. This result fully matches to the conclusion made by N.A.Kozyrev. He came to this conclusion on the basis of the analysis ofobservational astronomical data. According to this conclusion, the processes ofthermonuclear synthesis cannot serve as a main source of stellar energy.At present time the presence of numerous and various solar-earth and moon-earthconnections, which cannot be explained from positions of traditional physics, isfirmly determined. The given circumstance makes us to regard Kozyrev’shypothesis on the interrelation of all world phenomena by means of physicalproperties of Time with attention.348[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-348]But what has all this to do with the Red Mercury legend? Why even associateKozyrev’s work with it?The association at one level lies in what may be the more than coincidentalattack on Kozyrev in Pravda in 1959, effectively preventing him from openpublication of his experimental results and theoretical conceptualizations, andthe similarly-timed disappearance of discussion of clean fusion bombs in theopen Soviet literature. Let us speculate a bit.We have already encountered the fact that the earliest atmospheric hydrogen bombtests far exceeded their pre-test calculated yields. In other words, just as instars, some other energy source was being tapped into, and transduced by, thethermonuclear detonation itself. And if we extend this line of speculation, theRussians most likely encountered the same phenomenon in their hydrogen bombtesting. Moreover, in Kozyrev, they had an astrophysicist who thought he knewwhy stars, also implicating thermonuclear processes, appeared not to beradiating neutrinos energy for the thermonuclear model to be true.One may reasonably and logically conclude, therefore, that the 1959 Pravdaattack on Kozyrev was really a cover story to denounce his work, tode-legitimize it to anyone in the West who may have been paying attention to it,while Kozyrev, and his work, disappeared — as they did — into the highestreaches of classification within the Soviet Union, for his work provided thenecessary key to understand why H-bombs were returning such anomalous yields,yields that, moreover, most likely varied with the time of their detonation.Kozyrev knew why: it was because the bomb itself became, for that briefbrilliant nanosecond of the initial explosion, a dimensional gateway, asluice-gate, opening the spillway to a hyper-dimensional cascade of torsion intothe reaction itself.And with his subsequent investigation of the torsion shielding and amplifyingproperties of various materials, we have another clue, perhaps, to what theSoviets were really after as well, for his investigations also opened up thepossibility of precisely the creation of a “ballotechnic explosive,” of aconventional explosive powerful enough to initiate a thermonuclear fusion bombwithout the necessity of an A-bomb for a “fuse,” for torsion, as noted in themany quotations cited throughout this chapter, could impress its processes intoa material, just like the Philosophers’ Stone, making such an explosivepossible, at least in theory.Indeed, if one now goes back and reconsiders the Red Mercury legend, and inparticular the peculiar “recipes” alleged for the confection of the substance —the “alchemical” presence of antimony in some of its alleged chemicalcompositions, and more importantly, the use of mercury and radioactive isotopes,and its synthesis by immersion in a reactor core under high heat and pressure —all of this suggests not only the alchemical parallel, but that the Russians,taking to heart Kozyrev’s work, had hit upon the very “Paracelsan” idea ofimpressing the motions of the heavenly bodies, of stars, of time, of torsion,into its confection.Small wonder, then, that with the collapse of the Soviet Union which sponsoredthat work, and the emergence of the Red Mercury scare of the 1990s, that theRussian government, through its considerable media organs, made every effort todenounce the one as a hoax, and the other as leading to pseudo-science.But as has been seen, Kozyrev’s work is hardly the latter, and that casts thewhole Red Mercury episode into a very different light indeed.Perhaps, just perhaps, it was, after all, a code name for the SovietPhilosophers’ Stone, the red tincture of the Great Elixir, the Red “Mercury”able to draw down the fires of the stars and of time itself, for time, asKozyrev pointed out, was what ultimately fires them to begin with…."},{"pageContent":"9CONCLUSIONS TO PART THREE019 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_019_r1.jpg]“For invisible celestial influences and the impressions of the stars are in thevery first degree necessary for the work.”Philippus Theophrastus Areolus Bombastus von Hohenheim, a.k.a.

Kozyrev351 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-351] What conclusions may be drawn from our examination throughout parts one throughthree that can guide us into the belly of the brutish beast of Nazism and theThird Reich’s own alchemical pursuits? To answer this question, it will behelpful to reprise verbatim the conclusions of the two previous sections, addingthose we have discovered in this one.From Part One, we concluded the following:1) The Stone comes in at least two or, more especially, three “parts,” amaterial “body” and a more ethereal “soul,” implying that whatever propertieswere being observed and referred to by the alchemists, that some of themappeared to exist in a state beyond that of the three dimensions of normalmatter itself; in short, and in more modern terms, there was a hyper-dimensionalaspect to the Philosophers’ Stone, points which shall be taken up again in partstwo and three;a. This aspect is made more apparent by the later references in the Middle Agesto the Stone having at least one constituent which “occupies no space,” apeculiar quality easily explainable by reference to higher dimensions;b. In one very questionable instance, that of the Englishman Digby, it appearsto be able to effect action at a distance;2) The Stone appears to exist in at least three states:a. As a stone or mineral;b. As a reddish-purple Elixir, Tincture, or Liquid; and,c. As a powder or granular particulate;3) The successful confection of “Alchemical Gold” is signaled by a distinctiveprogression through the electromagnetic optical spectrum, with the salientpoints being a progression from white to reddish-purple, the latter of whichdenotes the acquisition of the Great Elixir;4) Throughout all versions of the confection of the Stone, an elaborate processis implied, involving the use of heat at every step, and in one case — that ofMoses and the Golden Calf — involving very intense heat able actually to consumeor burn gold itself, an observation that in turn requires a rather sophisticatedfurnace or forge technology;5) It is also claimed that the Stone, Great Tincture, or Grand Elixir is able toeffect cures, healing, and to prolong human life far beyond its natural lifespan;6) It is also claimed that the Stone is indestructible, partaking directly ofthe indestructibility of the underlying primary transmutative medium;7) In the suggestive references to be found in the Chinese alchemist Go-Hung,the “Pill of Immortality” must be fashioned on a great and famous mountain, anallusion, perhaps, to the distant connection between alchemy and pyramids; andfinally,8) Throughout alchemical literature not only are certain minerals associatedwith certain celestial bodies but also the very processes of alchemicaloperations are with those bodies as well, implying that these processes arewrought most efficiently when those bodies are in certain alignments. Moreover,the association of astrology with certain gems — with crystals — also implies anassociation of lattice structures of crystals with celestial geometries, asignificant insight as we shall see in future chapters;9) Finally, as noted in the examination of Paracelsus, some alchemicalexperiments and operations could only successfully be performed at specifictimes and seasons, a point which will become a primary focus of part two.The following conclusions and implications were developed in part two (notingthat the numbering of points has been changed in this context):10) The basic principles and assertions of certain alchemical texts areverified, namely:a. with respect to the color sequence indicating successful confection of thePhilosophers’ Stone: Hudson, via known and standard chemical and physicaltechniques, was able to replicate the overall color sequence of the derivationof the Philosophers’ Stone. As was seen, two of these colors, a cranberry-redcolor, almost the color of grape juice, signified a stage in the process whichended with a fine “white powder of gold”;b. with respect to the composition of the Philosophers’ Stone: As was seen fromchapter one, many alchemical texts stressed the powder form of the Philosophers’Stone, a form amply demonstrated by Hudson’s material;c. with respect to the Philosophers’ Stone “occupying no space yet beingconfined in matter”: As was seen, one of the most significant anomaliesexhibited by Hudson’s white powder was its unusual mass loss anomaly, an anomalythat physicist Hal Puthoff explained by maintaining that some of the materialwas actually existing in a wholly different space and time, a “sub-” or“hyperspace.” Thus, alchemical texts that indicate the existence of thePhilosophers’ Stone in different “worlds” would appear to be capable ofinterpretation along hyper-dimensional physical models.11) In turn, these anomalous properties appear to be based upon:a. Extraordinary or non-ordinary geometries and shapes of atomic nuclei inelements within the platinum-group to mercury range in the periodic table of theelements; these are in turn the result of,b. extremely high-spin states of the nuclei; furthermore,i) in some cases these states are excited at a spin frequency of 19.5, anddeexcited at a spin frequency of 21.5, in apparent correlation of the“tetrahedral physics” model of popular Mars anomalies researcher Richard C.Hoagland; that is to say, energy appears to gate, in some elements, into thesystem at 19.5, and to exit or deexcite at 21.5, indicating the possibility thatHoagland’s model might be scale-invariant;c. the total angular momentum of the system, which is composed of twosub-systems:i) the individual particles in the nuclear shells; and,ii) the total angular momentum in the “proto-nuclear cluster” of thesuperdeformed nucleus;12) These superdeformed atoms apparently bond in “quasi-molecular fashion” via aresonance phenomenon related to the spin frequencies and angular momentum oftheir various nucleus shells;13) These superdeformed atoms likewise can undergo spontaneous asymmetricalfission without neutron bombardment, and often can yield extremely high burstsof gamma radiation when deexciting from their high-spin state. The weaponizationpotential and implications of this phenomenon will be explored in the next twoparts of the book. Similarly, superdeformed nuclear isotopes in a high-spinstate do not decay at standard rates of radioactive decay.From this part of the work, and summarizing the preceding points, the followingconclusions may be drawn:14) Kozyrev’s work implies that space and time themselves are quantizedphenomena, and this in turn verifies the indications in alchemical texts thatalchemists observed similar quantized phenomena in their operations;15) Similarly, Kozyrev’s work also demonstrated that the experimental operationsperformed at different times yielded surprisingly different results, verifyingsimilar observations by alchemists, and placing their assertions that celestialgeometries — i.e., the proper times — were an essential component to thesuccessful performance of their work;16) Kozyrev also demonstrated that the spiraling geometry of torsion, with allits hyper-dimensional properties, was essential to a proper understanding oftime and its influence on physical processes, to the extent that torsionimparted a spin orientation to physical systems, verifying, from a differentperspective, the observations David Hudson made concerning the high-spin statesof his anomalous platinum group materials;17) Likewise, Kozyrev’s work also demonstrated that torsion fields could impressthemselves into a physical system, such that after the removal of the originalfields from that system, that it in turn could impress those dynamics on otherisolated physical systems, thus confirming the alchemical view that the mediumis non-local and that information transfer can occur at superluminal velocitiesbetween systems, and that the Philosophers’ Stone could impress its dynamics onother material at a distance;18) With his observations concerning the anomalous energy output of stars andthe inability of the thermonuclear fusion model of stellar energies to accountfor all their energy production, Kozyrev also obliquely confirmed the alchemicalview that celestial geometries, and in particular the position of the sun, werecrucial to their work;19) With his own observations of weight gains and losses depending on therotational orientation of his experimental systems, Kozyrev similarly confirmedthe anomalous weight gains observed by Hudson in his materials — which were dueto their high spin state — and the observations of the alchemists themselveswhich suggested that they too observed anomalous patterns of weight gains andlosses in their experiments;20) With the implication, suggested by Kozyrev himself, that hyper-dimensionaltorsion effects could also account for the variations of perception in consciousobservers of the faster or slower pace of the flow of time, Kozyrev likewiseprovided a physical basis for alchemical insistence that the consciousness ofthe alchemist himself be adequately prepared, implying that they too hadobserved similar phenomena;21) By dint of his extensive testing of various elements and compounds for theirtorsion amplifying and shielding properties, and by subjecting such substancesto a variety of processes of stress — heating, cooling, vibrating, spinning, andso on — Kozyrev paralleled the similar operations of the alchemists, and ofDavid Hudson, who similarly subjected their materials to a variety of intenseand stress-inducing processes. In all of this, Kozyrev was laying thefoundations for a new science of “causal mechanics” and the engineering ofexotic materials able to take on certain impressed dynamics, and impress them —or unleash them — on other materials. In this, too, he parallels and to acertain extent confirms the insights and observations of alchemy over thecenturies.22) Finally, we saw that the theoretical possibility of a “torsion substance,”that is, of a compound impressed with the very properties of torsion itself andtherefore able to some extent to induce or transduce it into our normalthree-dimensional space, was possible, giving some possible foundation to theRed Mercury legend as having some actual basis in truth. It may indeed have beena substance calling down the extreme fires and energies of the stars, itself, asseen repeatedly in the previous pages, an alchemical conception.We may, therefore, with some confidence, and some trepidation, now turn to themost alchemical material of them all: The Nazi Serum of the Alchemical Reich."},{"pageContent":"Part FourTHE NAZI “SERUM” AND THE ALCHEMICAL REICH020 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_020_r1.jpg]“The German alchemist Franz Tausend began to produce gold from mercury in the1920s.

This newprocess makes the stolen plutonium only a few hundredths of a percent less thancompletely pure. With such pure plutonium, the high school student’s homemadeA-bomb has a far larger yield and destructiveness than he imagined, and themilitary spares no effort to track Stephens, and his bomb, down.What is of interest here is the technology for isotope separation and enrichmentonly very briefly described in the first initial minutes of the movie. In pointof fact, the description is so brief that one might miss it entirely if one didnot realize its significance, nor its horrifying real world existence. Thisbrief description, given by Lithgow’s character Dr. John Mathewson, cited in theepigraph that began this chapter, even more oddly finds a peculiar — and indeedhorrifying — echo in the real world almost exactly forty-one years earlier.And as if to magnify the already horrifying implications of that fact, it wasalso made by a small group of Nazi physicists…A. THE FARCE AT FARM HALL: WIRTZ AND DIEBNER ON THE PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCESS OFISOTOPE ENRICHMENTThe group that made the comments were, of course, some of the German A-bombscientists interred at Farm Hall, England, after the war. And indeed, some oftheir comments are the source of a persisting mystery, which I first mentionedin my book Reich of the Black Sun: Nazi Secret Weapons and the Cold War AlliedLegend. But the mystery did not stop there. As many have discovered, enteringresearch into Nazi secret weapons presents mysteries capable of severaldifferent types of analysis.And the statements of the German scientists at Farm Hall are certainly one ofthem. To see why, it is once again necessary to see what I wrote before aboutthem, in my book The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, for that background is neededto understand the new analysis that occurs in this chapter, courtesy of Mr.Richard C. Hoagland, and discussions we had over several days in the finalmonths of 2007.With that in mind, here is what I wrote in The SS Brotherhood of the Bell: “When approaching the more extreme claims advanced in some exotic literature forNazi secret weapons developments, one has the impression of some dark mediaevalalchemists’ laboratory, with the alchemists dressed in the black uniforms of theSS, cracking whips on the backs of emaciated concentration camp slaves toperfect their dreadful machines of power and annihilation. It has all theelements — were the scope of human suffering involved not so real and soenormous — of a bad Hollywood “B” movie, with a gaunt Boris Karlofforchestrating an oddball cast that includes Bela Lugosi, Peter Lorre, VincentPrice and Sydney Greenstreet, all playing larger-than-life villains conspiringto conquer the world.“But the situation is not helped by the strange quotations from reliable sourceswhich, if one really pays attention to them, should give one pause. Consider twoexamples from the Farm Hall Transcripts, the transcripts of the conversations ofthe German atom-bomb scientists interred at Farm Hall, secretly recorded by theBritish and declassified by them only in 1992. The two examples, which I citedwithout extensive commentary in my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, Reichof the Black Sun, concern artificial rubies, and an unknown “photochemicalprocess” of isotope enrichment. I will cite both sets of quotations and myremarks concerning them from that book directly.1. THE “ARTIFICIAL RUBIES” PASSAGE FROM THE FARM HALL TRANSCRIPTS (REICH OF THEBLACK SUN, PP. 142–132)“On pages 142 and 143 of Reich of the Black Sun I observed that one of theinterred Farm Hall scientists made a rather astonishing statement, a statementmade astonishing not only for its “matter-of-fact” passing nature and brevity,but also because it called forth almost no comment from the editor of thetranscripts:Then, on July 21, 1945, the handsome and cynical Horst Korsching, discussing theprospects for making a living with Diebner and Bagge, offers a curiousobservation: “BAGGE: For the sake of the money, I should like to work on the uranium engine;on the other hand, I should like to work on cosmic rays. I feel like Diebnerabout this. “KORSCHING: Would you both like to construct an uranium engine? “DIEBNER: This is the chance to earn a living. “KORSCHING: Every layman can see that these ideas are exceedingly important.Hence there won’t be any money in it. You only make money on ideas which haveescaped the general public. If you invent something like artificial rubies forthe watch making industry, you will make more money than with the uraniumengine.”353 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-353]“I then commented as follows:Artificial rubies? Of course, such things were used in watchmaking before theinvention of quartz movement. But in 1945, the idea was fantastic. Of course, bythe time of the declassification of these transcripts, the world’s first laser,which did in fact use an artificial ruby as the main component of the lasingoptical cavity, was history, having been invented in 1961. But in July 1945 theidea was more than a little ahead of its time. Is this another possible, thoughslight, indication that something else was going on inside Nazi Germany? Laterin the conversation, Korsching expresses his desire to return Hechingen tocollect his telescope, lenses and prisms, an indication that he was perhapsinvolved in optical as well as nuclear research.354[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-354]“The mention there of the connection between lasers and artificial rubies wasnot accidental, for on page 104 of Reich of the Black Sun, I cited the followingquotation from former British intelligence officer-cum-journalist Tom Agoston,who first broke the story of the Kammlerstab, the SS’s secret weapons thinktank, to the West in the 1980s:Its purpose was to pave the way for building nuclear-powered aircraft, workingon the application of nuclear energy for propelling missiles and aircraft; laserbeams, then still referred to as “death rays”: a variety of homing rockets, andto seek other potential areas for high-technology breakthrough. In modernhigh-tech jargon, the operation would probably be referred to as an “SS researchthink tank.” Some work on second-generation secret weapons, including theapplication of nuclear propulsion for aircraft and missiles, was already welladvanced.355 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-355]“What is interesting is the juxtaposition of these two quotations, for whileAgoston offers no evidence for his assertion that the SS was working on thedevelopment of lasers during the war, he nonetheless clearly states that thiswas an avenue of research being pursued.“Thus, the subsequent appearance of the Farm Hall Transcripts in the early 1990soddly corroborates Agoston’s assertions with Korsching’s very curious referenceto artificial rubies, a then costly and time-consuming process that surely wouldhave merited more than merely making rubies for watches. Since the transcriptshad not yet been declassified by the British government when Agoston wrote hisbook, we can only assume that Agoston did not know the contents of the stillsecret Transcripts and was basing his assertions on his confidential talks withDr. Wilhelm Voss, who first disclosed the story of Kammler’s black projectssecret weapons think tank.“This juxtaposition argues very strongly, though only circumstantially, that theSS was indeed involved in researching lasers. While we do not yet know how farthey pressed this research, nor to what degree of success, it is in any case notof immediate concern, since the theoretical possibility of lasers alreadyexisted within quantum mechanics at that time.“But what is of real interest is the type of physics that Agoston’s andKorsching’s remarks — made decades apart and independently of each other —indicate about the nature of the physics concepts the Germans wereinvestigating, in this case, aspects of quantum mechanics and coherence. As wasseen in Reich of the Black Sun, Nazi ideology itself, with its rejection of“Jewish” relativistic physics, would have naturally turned to the home-grown,“purely Aryan” and equally successful, quantum mechanical theory as a conceptualbasis from which to pursue its advanced projects. We shall return to thisall-important though brief clue, coherence, in a moment. For now, let us turnour attention to a second odd quotation, another weird glimpse into the possibleareas of physics the SS was investigating.2. THE FARM HALL TRANSCRIPT’S INDICATIONS OF A GERMAN PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCESS OFISOTOPE SEPARATION AND ENRICHMENT“As recounted in Reich of the Black Sun, once the interred German scientists hadlearned of the Allied A-bombing of Hiroshima, they then begin to debate how theAllies could have “done it so soon,” a discussion that naturally quickly turnsto the question of separating and enriching enough uranium-235 isotope. In oneshort exchange between Karl Wirtz and Otto Hahn, the discoverer of nuclearfission, the deduction is quickly made by Hahn that the Allies could only haveachieved the production of a uranium A-bomb with such processes, a sentimentquickly echoed by Wirtz with his comment “They have it too,”356[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-356] a short admission pregnantwith implications that methods of isotope separation were clearly known andavailable to the Germans during the war.“But as I noted in Reich of the Black Sun, ‘a short, but astonishing, exchangebetween Hahn, Weizsäcker, Harteck, Wirtz, and Diebner’ then follows:HAHN: I think it’s absolutely impossible to produce one ton of uranium 235 byseparating isotopes. WEIZSÄCKER: What do you do with these centrifuges? HARTECK: You can never get pure “235” with the centrifuge. But I don’t believethat it can be done with the centrifuge. WIRTZ: No certainly not. HAHN: Yes, but they could do it with mass spectrographs. Ewald has some patent. DIEBNER: There is also a photochemical process.357[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-357]As Reich of the Black Sun goes on to indicate, this little exchange is a signthat perhaps the scientists are playing out a farce on their British captors,and that the farce may even be continuing by the British themselves in theirdeclassification of the transcripts.“What do I mean by this? What I mean is that the British declassification issignificant for when it occurs, and I only explored a few of the possiblereasons in the previous book:Note that the transcripts are declassified by the British after the Germanreunification in 1989, an oblique admission, perhaps, that there was no morepurpose in maintaining whatever secrets they still held, since there would nowbe other sources available to tell the story that had been long suppressed: thatthe Nazis had been either perilously close to, or had actually acquired the atombomb before the Allies.358 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-358]To see what the “farce” being played out by the interred German scientists andthe British government’s declassification may be, one needs to examine asignificant question that I only hinted at in various places in Reich of theBlack Sun: What is this “photochemical process”?“A second reference to this mysterious unknown photochemical process occurs alittle later in the Transcripts, during a brief but very suggestive interchangebetween Hartek and Wirtz:HARTEK: They have managed it with mass spectrographs on a large scale or elsethey have been successful with a photochemical process. WIRTZ: Well I would say photochemistry or diffusion, ordinary diffusion. Theyirradiate it with a particular wavelength (all talking together). 359[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-359] I then commented as follows:At this juncture, Bernstein360[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-360] again observes that “it isnot clear” what this photochemical process is.361[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-361] In any case, whatever theprocess was, Wirtz’s mention of it and of irradiation with a particular“wavelength” appears to have provoked a burst of conversation from the otherscientists. Were they intentionally trying to drown him out and mask hisstatements so as not to be recorded? We will never know.362[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-362]But perhaps we really do know what this mysterious though unknown photochemicalprocess of isotope enrichment is.“A clue is again afforded by the timing of the declassification of the Farm HallTranscripts: after German reunification. But their declassification also occursafter another significant event, the discovery and publication of the first coldfusion experiments by Pons and Fleischmann. Most do not associate cold fusionwith isotope separation and enrichment, but the fact of the matter is, by veryeasily engineered processes that might best be called precisely “electrolytic”or “photochemical,” nuclear transmutation of elements has been observed inlaboratories all over the world since then, and using materials relativelyeasily obtained, and able to be engineered in any competent high school or in agarage laboratory bench. The literature covering these cold fusiontransmutations is easily available on any internet search.363[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-363]“If this or something similar is indeed what the Germans meant by a‘photochemical process,’ then the contents of the Farm Hall Transcripts arenothing less than revolutionary, for it means that we have a second indicator,in a very different way, that the Germans were researching the phenomenon ofquantum coherence of the medium in a variety of systematically pursued ways.364[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-364] On this view the timing ofthe release of the transcripts is significant in a dual way, as occurring (1)after German reunification and (2) after the first public release of cold fusionexperimental data.“The implications of the transcripts’ two allusions to such a photochemicalprocess by interred German scientists in 1945 is staggering, for if they hadactually discovered and conducted such experiments — and there was certainlyideological impetus from the Nazi government in its pursuit of ‘energyindependence’ to do so — and if they had advanced from an initial ‘Pons andFleischman’ apparatus to a more sophisticated version that accomplished thetransmutation of elements at room temperature, as in the recent Japaneseexperiments, then we have a second, though still tenuous, indicator that the SSwas pursuing some very extraordinarily advanced physics conceptions indeed. Andthere would have been little if anything required in such experiments that didnot exist in some form available to the Germans during the war.“Small wonder then, that when Wirtz begins to talk of irradiation at particularwavelengths that the other scientists appear to begin talking all at once, as ifto drown out his comments from the British recorders, an effort that, if onetakes Bernstein’s editorial mystification as any indicator, was entirelysuccessful.365 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-365]“What do we have, then, at this juncture?“First, we have allusions, from the same source, to two different phenomena —lasers and a ‘photochemical process’ of nuclear transmutation — involvingquantum coherence at some level. Second, in the case of the reference toartificial rubies and their implied use in lasers, we have further corroborationfrom an independent source of research, Agoston, whose corroboration of the“laser” side of the story comes prior to the release of the Transcriptsthemselves and Korsching’s passing remark about artificial rubies. Finally, thedeclassification and release of the Farm Hall Transcripts themselves may besignificant with respect to timing in a dual sense, as occurring after Germanreunification, and after the first public release of cold fusion laboratory databy Pons and Fleischmann.”And there, more or less, is where my analysis in The SS Brotherhood of the Bellended, but a new possibility emerged.After SS Brotherhood was published, I was invited to be interviewed by Mr. TimVentura for his well-known website American Antigravity.366[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-366] The interview was, ofcourse, about the Nazi Bell. Mr. Ventura in turn was a friend and associate ofwell-known space science and Mars anomalies researcher Richard C. Hoagland.Unbeknownst to me, Mr. Ventura had mentioned my books to Mr. Hoagland, and outof that mention developed an initial contact and series of emails beginning inthe autumn of 2007. Over the course of these emails, Mr. Hoagland asked forcopies of all my books, which I arranged to send him.After reading SS Brotherhood, Mr. Hoagland began a series of emails with me,concerning a different possibility of analysis of the above texts concerning themysterious “photochemical process” than I mentioned in the book. To be honest, Ihad considered, and rejected, the idea for inclusion in my analysis of thismystery of the Farm Hall transcripts in SS Brotherhood, for a variety ofreasons, not the least of which were the technological difficulties to beencountered at the time, and hence I opted for a less technologicallysophisticated interpretive speculation — cold fusion — in the book.Mr. Hoagland’s analysis and argumentation, however, cause me to reconsider theidea. By presenting his analysis here, and offering what I believe to be someadditional circumstantial information that possibly corroborates this new, farmore radical, interpretation, I hope to exhibit how this speculation actuallyresolves other mysteries from the war not previously mentioned in any of mybooks on Nazi secret weapons research. It is also to be noted that Mr.Hoagland’s interpretation sticks very closely to the transcript text itself, andadditionally, provides yet another rationale in addition to the ones offered inSS Brotherhood for the reason that the transcripts were kept classified for solong.But first, Mr. Hoagland’s analysis.B. RICHARD C. HOAGLAND’S ANALYSIS AND HYPOTHESISOn Tuesday, November 20, 2007, around nine-thirty in the evening, I received thefollowing email from Mr. Hoagland, and it began a series of discussions betweenus.1. HOAGLAND’S ANALYSIS AND HYPOTHESIS: THE EMAILSJoseph,My second point concerns certain “enigmatic” references within the “Farm HallTranscripts.”(Remember, we had already been emailing back and forth discussing other topicsof no relevance here. He continues):Specifically, the (apparent) mystery of what was meant when one of the captiveGerman scientists (Diebner) referred to as a “photochemical (isotope separation)process….” And later, when another one (Wirtz) says — “Well, I would sayphotochemistry or diffusion, ordinary diffusion. They irradiate it with aparticular wavelength — ”And then, everyone in the room (according to the transcriber…) starts “talkingat once” — as if they know they’re being recorded by their British “hosts” andwant to drown out any further tell-tale references…OK, this process is not “mysterious.” It’s well-known — now.It’s called “laser isotope separation.”…Now, lasers (supposedly) did not exist in the early 1940s.However, if the previous reference in these same Farm Hall transcripts youquote, to “artificial rubies,” was accurate, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist(!) to put these references together… and plausibly propose that these obliquestatements to “photochemical isotope separation” could actually refer to apossible Nazi laser project for precisely such isotope separation! At least —theoretically.Broadband, high-intensity lights — even with “narrowband” filters — simply couldnot do the job. It takes the ultra-narrowband (hundredths of an Angstrom wide!),tunable lasers (a second or third generation laser development…) to even beginto do this properly. But —If they had the idea (based on the German development of quantum mechanics), therest was “only” money … and time.Thus, those two (supposedly unconnected) references would seem to argue that theGermans had thought of “lasers” a long time before Townes made it practical… andmay have even made some working systems!…once you’re on the trail — especially, if you have essentially unlimited(Reichsmarks), a lot of later laser developments (like, the invention of“tunable dye lasers”) could have been radically compressed in time; nothing likea war…Anyway, just thought you’d like to know...367[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-367]And there, Mr. Hoagland’s remarkably succinct and breathtaking email ended,leaving my mind running a thousand different directions.As I stated previously, I had considered the idea, and rejected it, largely forthe technological degree of sophistication required to make it work, asophistication Mr. Hoagland himself mentions in his email. But this was not whatreally caught my attention. What caught my attention were two things I had notconsidered, and that Mr. Hoagland very evidently had.In order to see what things really caught my attention in his email, it would behelpful to summarize his argument:1. The German scientists clearly imply a photochemical process of enrichment byreferences to irradiating material with “a particular wavelength”;2. Such a process is well-known today, though in World War II it is decades inadvance of the thinking of the day (after all, the Manhattan Project had notthought of, nor pursued, its development);3. The scientists all begin talking as if to drown out further commentary, as ifthey are protecting a great secret, and confirming the suspicions of manyanalysts that the Nazi scientists knew they were being recorded;4. Korsching’s reference to the manufacture of “artificial rubies” — the lasingcavity for the first known optical laser a decade and a half later — is thuscorroboratory of some sort of laser project in Nazi Germany, “at least —theoretically” as Mr. Hoagland puts it.5. Having thought of the concept of lasers, and laser isotope enrichment, theNazis would then have realized that in order to separate various isotopes ofvarious elements, they would need not a solid state lasing optical cavity, likea ruby crystal, but a gaseous one, one that was tunable to the wavelengths ofparticular isotopes over an extremely narrow bandwidth no wider than a fewhundredths of Angstrom units;6. They “may have even made some working systems!” and finally,7. They may have done so if there were adequate funding — pile of Reichsmarksand enough labor and technical staff — to do it.Note very carefully what Mr. Hoagland is not saying. He is not saying that theyactually did it, but only acknowledging the possibility that they may have doneso, and pointing to the specific remark of Korsching mentioning artificialrubies as an indicator that thinking along the lines of lasers, and perhaps thefirst steps on the technology tree to the tunable laser — the first-generationsolid state optical lasing cavity, a ruby laser — may have been actually taken.But it was precisely Korsching’s remark, and Mr. Hoagland’s reference to whatmight have been accomplished with enough money, that stuck in my mind. I clung(rather desperately, I might add) to the technological difficulty, and respondedto Mr. Hoagland’s email, all the while knowing certain odd facts and mysteriesfrom the war that were not mentioned in SS Brotherhood of the Bell, andtherefore were presumably unknown to Mr. Hoagland, knowing full well that theynot only tended to corroborate his analysis, but even more besides:Richard,Well, laser isotope separation...by Nazis!?!?!? I thought I was pressing thepoint too much with the little cold fusion excursion…! Even mentioning lasers inconnection with it seemed to me to be crawling way out on a limb…. Yes I knew ofthis process (of laser isotope separation)…, but thought I’d be crucified badlyenough for what I did say…But...as you say…nothing like a war and unlimited Reichsmarks to light theway…they had Hartek’s centrifuges, they had Von Ardenne’s mass spectrometerversion of Lawrence’s beta calutrons…so why not lasers?As can be seen, what had sparked my mind to consider the possibility moreseriously was Mr. Hoagland’s reference to “enough money,” implying a seriouscrash program to develop the technology needed for massive enrichment of verypure fissile material in an atom bomb project. More about this in a moment.As can also be seen, my chief difficulty — the one that had prevented me frommentioning the laser isotope separation possibility in SS Brotherhood — wasprecisely the difficulty of the technological sophistication in lasers requiredto pull it off:Interesting observation you have about tunable lasers and the remarks of“irradiating it with a particular wavelength…” Now that does really open aPandora’s Box if indeed this is what Wirtz is referring to! It is, if you’recorrect, just downright scary.If you’re right (and from the purely scientific point of view I see no reason tothink you’re wrong here), then there is even more research to do on what theNazis were really up to. The technological aspect here is the only downside…could they have really pulled that off??368[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-368]In other words, it was not for lack of funding, for the SS, as I had establishedin Reich of the Black Sun and in The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, would have beenresponsible for such a project, and it was awash with money, and able to draw onan almost limitless supply of slave labor and skilled technicians and engineers.Hoagland had, in other words, by his emphasis on money and the wartimesituation, forced me to reconsider the possibility. And as my email response tohim indicates, I was clinging doggedly to the technological difficulty of such aproject.Having fired off this email response, I thought surely the technologicaldifficulty would persuade him of the difficulty of this suggestion ever havingbeen an actual possible project inside the Third Reich.Not so:Joseph,(The) major point in favor of Nazi laser development, or at least, theoreticalexplorations of the same:It was not contrary to existing quantum physics. In fact, many science writersand physicists, over the past decades, have wondered again and again why it tookso long to actually “invent” the laser — given the long history of quantummechanics before Townes finally built one…“Cold Fusion,” on the other hand, was a “lucky accident.”And, because its explanation is not standard quantum physics…its fulldevelopment has been (so far) delayed by almost a full generation (at least —publicly).So far, so good, the science was there. We both knew that. And, interestinglyenough, Hoagland is implying yet another possible alternative and “suppressedphysics” explanation for recent history, namely, the reason that the laser wasnot publicly invented much sooner was that the Nazis had already done so as acomponent of isotope separation for their atom bomb project. Now, while he hasnot stated this in so many words, it is the clear implication of his remarks.And indeed, as I had pointed out in my comments in The SS Brotherhood of theBell which were cited previously, one of the things the British journalistAgoston had in fact explicitly stated was that they had actually built laserswithin the super-secret black projects think tank of SS Obergruppenführer HansKammler! So, the science was there, as I had clearly stated in SS Brotherhoodand as Mr. Hoagland had also outlined in his next email to me, and theallegation was there in Mr. Agoston’s statements that they had actually builtlasers.The case was beginning to build, yet the technological sophistication stillweighed in my mind. Ruby lasers certainly, at the minimum, seemed to be impliedby the totality of the comments in the Farm Hall Transcripts and the widercontext of information known about the Kammler Group (Kammlerstab). And let usrecall what the mission brief of the Kammlerstab was: it was to brainstorm itsway to second-, third-, and even fourth-generation weapons and technical systemsby mapping out the necessary steps of the technology trees to acquire them, andthen actually do it.369 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-369]Then Hoagland reminded me of one more interesting remark in the Farm HallTranscripts, a remark that pointed in a certain direction, a direction that Mr.Hoagland at that point in time did not know of, because he had not yet read mybook Reich of the Black Sun:So, no, lasers would have been a lot easier for the Nazis to imagine… anddevelop.And, those references to “artificial rubies” and “photochemical isotopeseparation” in those transcripts are major clues; you can only do photochemicalisotope separation with lasers — because of the ultra-narrow, ultra-stablefrequency control that’s needed. No other “photochemical light source” will dothe job. Period.So, why mention it…unless you know of the one way it can be done — becauseyou’ve seen it work?370 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-370]This last comment was really what made me consider the idea seriously, and topresent it here. For though he had not yet read Reich of the Black Sun, andhence did not yet know about what this comment suggested to me, as we shall see,his thinking independently was headed the same direction as mine now was, butwithout the aid of knowing what I knew…2. WHAT HARTEK SAW AT I.G. FARBEN AND WHAT MR. HOAGLAND DID NOT THEN KNOW: BACKTO THE AUSCHWITZ “BUNA FACTORY”What Hoagland’s remark about “seeing it work” reminded me of was a shortexchange in the Farm Hall Transcripts that I had cited in Reich of the BlackSun. Having not yet received that book nor read it, Mr. Hoagland could not haveknown why I found that remark so significant. Here is the exchange, placed inthe context in which it occurs in Reich of the Black Sun. The interred Germanscientists have just heard of the American A-bombing of Hiroshima, and aredebating how the Allies could have enriched so much uranium so quickly. I amindenting the block quotation of my own words from Reich of the Black Sun, andplacing the there-cited quotations from the Farm Hall Transcripts in quotationmarks:For Hartek and the other Farm Hall scientists, the problem was not means ormethods, it was simply a labor shortage, a shortage the SS was not experiencing.Later, Hartek is even more specific:“Considering the figures involved I think it must have been mass spectrographs(that the Allies used to enrich uranium). If they had had some other good methodthey wouldn’t have needed to spend so much. One wouldn’t have needed so manymen.”371 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-371]The standard reading of this passage according to the “postwar Allied Legend”is, of course, that Hartek, like all the German scientists, was bemoaning thefact that they simply did not have the money nor labor resources to enrichenough uranium on the scale of the Manhattan Project.But in Reich of the Black Sun I argued that this point within the Allied Legendis simply absurd in the extreme, since the SS with its enormous slave labor pooldid have such labor and monetary resources available. Indeed, following the leadof Carter P. Hydrick and other researchers into the matter, I suggested thatthis whole aspect of the Allied Legend of Nazi nuclear incompetence was adeliberate postwar misdirection to conceal a very large and very successful Nazienrichment process.However, if the misdirection were also being done to keep attention away fromthe Nazi enrichment technology itself — if indeed tunable lasers were one of thetechnologies involved — then there is yet another reason for the misdirection,for it would mean a laser technology that is at least second- orthird-generation technology had been developed to enrich very pure fissileisotopes, which would have allowed for smaller critical masses, and an A-bomb ofmuch lighter weight and smaller dimensions, able to be used as warheads on theirrockets. Mr. Hoagland’s suggestion, in other words, fit the overall context andpractical requirements of the Nazi A-bomb program quite well.It is in this context, then, that I believe one should read the followingexchange between the Farm Hall scientists. Once again, I am citing the contextfrom Reich of the Black Sun; the scientists’ actual conversation is noted by theappearance of their names prior to their individual comments:Korsching responds (to Hartek’s previously cited comments), and a small debateensues, in which a sensitive topic is barely touched upon by Hartek, andBernstein’s editorial comment becomes either an exercise in ignorance, ordeliberate omission:KORSCHING: “It was never done with spectrographs.”(Remember, this is the same Korsching who made the remark about artificialrubies!)HEISENBERG: “I must say I think your theory is right and that it isspectrographs.” WIRTZ: “I am prepared to bet that it isn’t.”This is a highly significant comment, and it is emphasized here. It is highlysignificant because, as I argued in Reich of the Black Sun, Heisenberg and thehigh-profile scientists were probably kept out of Nazi Germany’s real A-bombproject, and used as fronts for the Allies to worry about, while thelesser-known but equally capable scientists, such as Korsching, Deibner, Wirtzand so on, were involved with the real one being run by the SS. Thus, Heisenbergwould not have known, with his own abysmally small laboratory efforts, of anytechnologies of isotope enrichment being developed in uttermost secrecy by theSS. Hence, Wirtz’s comment to Heisenberg suggests that he knows of a technologyfor isotope enrichment vastly less labor-intensive, and much less costly, thanmass spectrographs, a technology that Heisenberg does not know about, or atleast, would not have considered to be practical.And let us not forget, this is the same Wirtz who made the remarks about“irradiating” an isotope with the proper wavelength to begin with!Thus, Mr. Hoagland’s suggestion of laser isotope enrichment begins to offer away of interpreting the statements of the Farm Hall scientists that makesperfect sense of the transcripts themselves, which the Allied Legend of Nazinuclear incompetence ultimately utterly fails to do.But Heisenberg then continues with his own statements that imply very clearlythat some sort of labor-intensive isotope enrichment project was underway inGermany. However, note carefully the remarks of Korsching and Hartek thatHeisenberg’s comments provoke:HEISENBERG: “What would one want 60,000 men for?” KORSCHING: “You try and vaporize one ton of uranium.” HARTEK: “You only need ten men for that. I was amazed at what I saw at I.G.”372[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-372]Before analyzing Korsching’s and Hartek’s comments, it is necessary to cite thecommentary I made in Reich of the Black Sun immediately after this passage:Bernstein’s373 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-373] only commenthere is to note the obvious, that “I.G.” means “I.G. Farben,” nothing else issaid. Either Bernstein is unaware of the Farben “Buna plant” and its mysteriousproperties of consuming more electricity than Berlin and producing no Buna, orhe has intentionally omitted any further clarification of Hartek’s remark. TheAllied Legend, in so far as Bernstein is concerned, is intact.374[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-374]But it isn’t intact at all. In fact, in the light of Mr. Hoagland’sextraordinary proposal about laser isotope enrichment, it would appear to bealtogether shredded.The reasons why are extraordinarily simple, and extraordinarily breathtaking atthe same time.Note the comment of Horst Korsching, the physicist, once again, who made thecomment about artificial rubies: “You try and vaporize one ton of uranium.” Ofcourse, one enrichment technology for which this process of reduction to a gaswould be necessary would be for thermal gaseous diffusion, a relativelyprimitive technology. It was certainly a technology the Germans possessed, butthe resulting purity of U-235 acquired from it would have been rather low, andrequired its deployment en masse in a manner similar to the Manhattan Project.But the other technology which would have utilized it would be precisely uraniumseparation by lasers.However, the thermal process, since it would have required massive amounts ofequipment and labor to run it, would have been labor-intensive, whereas laserenrichment would not. It is this fact that makes nuclear chemist Paul Hartek’scomment which follows so breathtaking: “You only need ten men for that,” tenmen, not thousands! In other words, Hartek’s brief comment by the nature of thecase implies a very advanced and sophisticated enrichment technology inexistence and being used by the Third Reich to enrich uranium! Even the use ofVon Ardenne’s mass spectrographs — a technology very similar to Lawrence’s betacalutrons in the American Manhattan Project — would have required more manpowerthan that, especially if employed en masse.The clincher is Hartek’s final statement: “I was amazed at what I saw at I.G.,”that is, at I.G. Farben.375 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-375]Why is this so significant?It is significant because, first, it points to the so-called synthetic rubber or“Buna” plant I.G. Farben built at Auschwitz, relying upon the massive amounts ofslave labor both to build and man it. However, as I pointed out in Reich of theBlack Sun, none of its signatures are those of a Buna plant at all. Its closeproximity to water, its need for a massive labor pool and technical staff, andits enormous electrical power consumption — it used more electricity than theentire city of Berlin, the eighth largest in the world at that time — and thefact that in the entire four years of its operation it produced not one ounce ofsynthetic rubber all point to the fact, as I argued in Reich of the Black Sun,that it was not a Buna factory at all, but a massive Oak Ridge-sized isotopeenrichment facility.376 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-376]But there are two additional factors that must now be mentioned and considered,for they corroborate the possibility that laser isotope enrichment may in facthave been one of the technologies employed at that plant. The first of these isthat the Buna plant itself was plagued by constant technical difficulties andbreakdowns. This would be inconceivable for a technologically sophisticated andexperienced company like Farben if the technology were only that of synthesizingrubber, or even, for that matter, the technologies of uranium enrichment bydiffusion or by mass spectrometers, both rather simple technologies. Farben’strack record of accomplishments in sophisticated industrial plants would seem torule this possibility out.So how to explain the constant difficulties and breakdowns Farben experienced inits “Buna” plant operations at Auschwitz? If one of the technologies employedwas indeed a primitive tunable laser technology utilizing gases rather thansolid state crystals as its lasing optical cavity, a rather sophisticatedtechnology, then the breakdowns make more sense.But the other reason Hartek’s mention of I.G. Farben is so significant is thatFarben was a chemical cartel; its expertise was in the manufacture of chemicalsand in particular, gases. If the Auschwitz “Buna plant” had only employedcentrifuge or mass spectrographs as its primary enrichment technologies, thenthe selection of an electrical engineering firm such as Siemens to build theplant at Auschwitz would have been far more logical.It is the fact that it was Farben which built the plant that points to theprobable use of other technologies implying sophisticated expertise in thehandling of gases that point in turn to the use of gaseous diffusion as oneprobable technology in use at Auschwitz en masse. This would explain the highelectrical consumption and enormous labor requirements.It is here, however, that Hartek’s remark must be recalled once again, for heclearly states that (1) he was amazed at what he saw, implying something inactual use by Farben, and (2) that what he saw required only ten people tooperate! The gaseous and thermal diffusion techniques known and available to theGermans (and everyone else), would hardly have been a technology to call forth“amazement” on Hartek’s part. It is this fact, plus the facts of its extremelylow labor requirements, and I.G. Farben’s peculiar track record ofaccomplishments in high-technology chemical processes and its expertise ingases, plus the fact of its consistent difficulties in operating the Auschwitzplant, that point to the possible use of some sort of extraordinarilysophisticated and, for the day, advanced technology of isotope separation andenrichment in use there.It points to, and corroborates, the possible use of tunable lasers.Reductions of a metal to gas. Use of light of specific frequency, or color, toaccomplish a transmutation and purification..It sounds a lot like alchemy…But more of that later.For now, let us return to Mr. Hoagland for a moment, and recall that when he waswriting his emails to me, he had not yet read the previously outlined facts inReich of the Black Sun. This makes the comments contained in his next email tome even more stunning, for they independently confirm the previously outlinedargumentation and analysis:Joseph:I guess I need to define “tunable.”…I mean, like mixing “a … lot of chemical compounds, made out of organic dyes,…And, lest it not be remembered, dyes were precisely how Farben and indeed, thewhole world-renowned German chemical industry got its start!...made out of organic dyes, placing them between parallel, reflecting telescopehalf-silvered mirrors (a standard optical technology in the 1940s…), andexciting these compounds with simple light to laser emission…In other words, the technology existed. All that was needed was the science,which was there, and the combination of this technology with the appropriatechemical know-how, which was also there in the form of Farben’s expertise andthe Kammlerstab’s well-known utilization of various technologies in newcombinations! And before we resume with Mr. Hoagland’s email, it should be notedthat Horst Korsching — the scientist who made the cryptic comment aboutartificial rubies — was also recorded at Farm Hall as stating his desire toreturn to Germany to collect his crystals and telescope. 377[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-377]Once the right compound was found (by brute trial and error, if no other way…)Which would be one way to account for the difficulties Farben was experiencingin operating its “Buna plant.”…then that specific compound could be scaled up to an industrial level laserseparation system…and voila, a working laser separation system.“Scaled-up” certainly the Auschwitz Farben plant was!So, the “tunable” part was in the (trial and error?) discovery and preparationof the right “lasing chemistry compound.” Once that was accomplished, separatingthe actual isotopes using this technology would be pretty straightforward…for asociety “making synthetic rubber,” making “synthetic oil,” etc. etc.And Nazi Germany was certainly synthesizing both to an astonishing degree. Inthe final analysis then, there is nothing unusual nor really so extraordinaryabout Mr. Hoagland’s proposal from the technological standpoint. Indeed, as hisremarks clearly imply, though he did not know all the details at the time, hehas certainly seen that the same case could be argued and advanced on a moredetailed basis here, as has been done.Money and political will. The only things ultimately required — if thetheoretical basis for the laser was known by some German physicists early in theWar.Oh, and an absolute dictatorship — to organize the men and materials to make itwork!Nothing else was needed; the science was built into the German quantummechanics…from the beginning.378[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-378]Once again, while Mr. Hoagland is not suggesting that the Nazis actually didthis, he is outlining the necessary parameters for what to look for if thepossibility is to be entertained. And as I have presently argued the case thusfar, a reasonable circumstantial case can be developed that this, indeed, mayactually have taken place, and that such technologies may actually have been inuse by I.G. Farben. There are few other plausible ways of interpreting all ofthe strange remarks in the Farm Hall transcripts.And if this argument actually be the case, it would afford yet anotherrationalization for why the Farm Hall Transcripts were kept classified for sovery long after the war; they implied a technology so far in advance of anythingin use or even envisioned by the Allies in the Manhattan Project, that if anyonewere the nuclear bunglers, it was the Allies, not the Germans.But is there any other evidence that would tend to corroborate the use of such asophisticated technology inside the Third Reich? Indeed there is. But before welook at those possible corroborations, we need to have a closer look at thetechnology itself. The closer look will afford a glance at why I originallybalked at this interpretation of the Farm Hall Transcripts and the AuschwitzBuna plant.3. THE MODERN VERSION OF TUNABLE LASERSWhen Mr. Hoagland first emailed me about his insights into the implications ofthe Farm Hall Transcripts, he included a link to a website where the laserisotope technology is outlined, shown, and explained for a general audience. Itis referred to here as it contains excellent pictures and good generalizeddescriptions of the actual technology and technique used in laser isotopeseparation.The website is that of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and thearticle is entitled “Laser Technology Follows in Lawrence’s Footsteps.”379[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-379] The basic idea of LaserIsotope Separation, or LIS as it is sometimes called, is simplicity itself:The technique is based on the fact that different isotopes of the same element,while chemically identical, absorb different colors of laser light. Therefore, alaser can be precisely tuned to ionize only atoms of the desired isotope, whichare then drawn to electrically charged collector plates.380[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-380]Note two things here that were already paralleled and implied in the Farm HallTranscripts.The first is the reference to ionization, a process that would in fact vaporizethe element, i.e., turn it into a gas. And this, of course, might be the processthat Korsching had in mind when he referred to vaporizing a ton of uranium. Thesecond is the reference to electrically charged collector plates. If such atechnology were employed by Farben at its “Buna plant” at Auschwitz on a largescale and en masse, then this would possibly also account for the plant’s highelectrical consumption just as well as would massive numbers of centrifuges,diffusion machines, or mass spectrographs.One gets an idea of the scale of such a laser from this picture whichaccompanies the article:The three large squares one sees in the picture are the actual separation tankscontaining the element to be separated, while the large tube leading into andout of them are the actual tubes conveying the tuned laser light into thetanks.381 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-381] In the light ofthe German nuclear chemist Paul Hartek’s remarks cited above that referred tosome technology of enrichment in use at I.G. Farben that only needed ten men, itis interesting that one sees just two men barely visible in the laser isotopeseparation facility at Lawrence Livermore Laboratories!But what is the most intriguing thing mentioned in the article is something thattends to corroborate the argumentation I made in the previous section. Thecomment occurs beneath the following picture:022 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_022_r1.jpg]Plant-Scale Tunable Dye Laser at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories382[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-382]The caption beneath this picture states the following information:LIS plant-scale dye laser chains absorb green light from solid state lasers andreemit it at a color that can be tuned to the isotope of interest. For uraniumenrichment, the green light was converted to red-orange light of the threedifferent wavelengths that are absorbed only by uranium-235.383[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-383]023 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_023_r1.jpg]Notice that the tunable gas dye laser is being stimulated by ordinary solidstate lasers to emit its lasing light. This is significant because the solidstate laser is precisely what is implied in Korsching’s remarks about artificialrubies.In other words, fully five decades before the technology at Lawrence Livermore,the Farm Hall Transcripts of the interred Nazi A-bomb scientists are makingremarks that imply the following technologies1) solid state lasers (Korsching’s artificial rubies comment);2) photochemical isotope separation and enrichment (Wirtz’s remark aboutirradiating a substance with specific wavelengths), which imply a tuneablechemical gas dye laser;And now, from Lawrence Livermore, we see why the Nazis apparently wereentertaining both ideas, for in the Lawrence Livermore version of the technology3) the use of the first, the solid state laser, to stimulate the lasing activityof the second, the chemical tunable gas dye laser.In other words, the comments of the Nazi scientists at Farm Hall — which clearlyin Hartek’s case imply an actual technology in use — would seem to indicate thatthey had rationalized the whole process out very thoroughly, and that in turnimplies once again, an actually existing though rudimentary tunable gas lasertechnology.There is another highly intriguing comment made in the Lawrence Livermorearticle:Development efforts to achieve high enrichment efficiency centered on improvinglaser beam uniformity and uranium vapor conditions. Eighty percent of theplant’s enrichment efficiency goal was achieved in several tests, including the290-hour demonstration tests in March 1999 that had laser systems operating atrecord power levels.384 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-384]One may infer from these observations that Lawrence Livermore was encounteringdifficulty in achieving the right vapor conditions for uranium, in controllingthe beam frequency, and also consuming enormous amounts of electrical power.Such difficulties would readily explain the otherwise inexplicable difficultiesI.G. Farben was experiencing operating its so-called “Buna plant” at Auschwitz,for if indeed it was a Buna plant, it should have posed no difficulty to Farbenwhatsoever. But controlling a precisely tuned laser beam from a chemical gas dyelaser being in turn stimulated to lasing action by solid state lasers, all withcrude 1940s technology, would explain it.But the real advantage of such a technology lies not only in its costeffectiveness, but also in the much greater purity of isotope obtained forsignificantly reduced passes through the system, a point which will becomeextremely important in the next section of this chapter:…the LIS process uses only 5 percent of the electricity consumed by existinggaseous diffusion plants, and LIS facilities would cost substantially less tobuild than those for other enrichment techniques such as centrifuge technology.The enrichment of uranium, from natural levels of 0.7 percent uranium- 235(235U) to between 3 and 5 percent 235U, is achieved in a few passes with LIS, agreat improvement over the hundreds to thousands of passes required by otherprocesses. This translates into a much smaller plant and production costssubstantially below those of either gaseous diffusion or gas centrifugetechnology….Indeed, the system is remarkably compact. A vacuum chamber holding one separatorunit produces output equivalent to that of several thousand of the bestcommercial centrifuges. A commercial LIS plant would use 84 enrichment units,compared to more than 150,000 centrifuge machines.…Instead of using uranium hexafluoride, the starting material required by otherprocesses, LIS uses uranium metal, which is less hazardous. Compared tocentrifuge or gaseous diffusion, the laser process requires about 30 percentless natural uranium ore to produce a comparable amount of enriched product,which also minimizes the amount of uranium tailings by about 30 percent.385[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-385]There are several points to be made here, each of which would have been ofsupreme importance to the Nazis, if they were aware of the theoreticalpossibilities of such a technology — and as has been seen there is everyindication that they were — or if they were in possession of some rudimentaryversion of it — and as has been seen a strong circumstantial case can be madethat they were.Note first something that seems to contradict our argument, and that is thatsuch a plant would consume far less electricity than a plant relying on massivebanks of diffusion gates or centrifuges. But I have never argued that only onetype of technology was in use at Auschwitz. However, suppose for the sake ofargument that only one type was in use, and that it was some rudimentary form ofLIS technology. As the above quotation makes clear, even a commercial plantwould require several such laser units, and this would — especially given a muchcruder form of it — still conceivably account for the Auschwitz plant’sanomalously high electrical consumption, especially if that plant were alsoproducing the gases for the lasers.Secondly, not only are much fewer passes necessary through the LIS plant — infact, the required number of passes is reduced several orders of magnitude — butthe result of such passes is much greater amount and purity of isotope material.For the Nazis, in a hurry to miniaturize their A-bombs to mount on their rocketwarheads, this technology is, in other words, an essential and necessarycomponent to that goal. From the standpoint of the exigencies of the war, then,the Nazi development of this technology seems not only logical, but is in acertain sense mandatory. At this stage of the argument, what would rather needto be explained is why they did not develop it if indeed they had known of itstheoretical possibility, which, once again, as seems evident from the Farm HallTranscript remarks of Korsching, Wirtz, and Hartek, they did.Note also, in conjunction with the previous point, that this also means lessuranium ore is needed to achieve the same results. Again, this would have beenanother selling point.The Lawrence Livermore article then produces the following diagram to illustratethe basic process of laser isotope enrichment:024 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_024_r1.gif]Basic Process of Laser Isotope Enrichment386[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-386]The following commentary precedes this diagram:In LIS enrichment, uranium metal is first vaporized in a separator unitcontained in a vacuum chamber. The vapor stream is then illuminated with laserlight tuned precisely to a color at which 235U absorbs energy.The generation of laser light starts with diode-pumped, solid-state lasersproviding short, high-intensity pulses at high repetition rates. This greenlight from the solid-state lasers travels via fiber-optic cable to energizehigh-power dye lasers….Given the several kilowatts of high average power of the dye laser beam, it’s asignificant achievement that the wavelengths are stable to better than 1 partin10 million and that the beam’s ability to travel long distances is nearlyperfectly preserved.Because the ionized 235U atoms are now “tagged” with a positive charge, they areeasily collected on negatively charged surfaces inside the separator unit. Theproduct material is condensed as liquid on these surfaces and then flows to acaster where it solidifies as metal nuggets. The unwanted isotopes, which areunaffected by the laser beam, pass through the product collector, condense onthe tailings collector, and are removed.387[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-387]Note the reference to one final technology involved with LIS, and to thecollection of the refined and separated 235U isotope as a liquid when firstseparated. Additionally, surely the first reference to fiber optic technologywould be beyond anything the Nazis dreamed of!Unfortunately, however, as we shall see in the next section, the idea of 235U —or of any isotope for that matter, existing in a very pure liquid condensatestate, and the idea of fiber optics, all in the historical context of NaziGermany, may, in fact, be just possible.C. OTHER MYSTERIES THAT TEND TO CORROBORATE HOAGLAND’S PROPOSALWere it only for Hoagland’s suggestions concerning the reading of the Farm HallTranscripts as implying some sort of rudimentary laser isotope separation, andwere it only for the more detailed “contextual case” based upon his ideapresented here, one might be inclined to grant the hypothesis a slightpossibility. After all, any such case as might be made for Nazi knowledge, muchless use, of laser isotope separation technology must remain circumstantial iffor no other reason than if that were the case, the postwar Allied Powers wouldbe loathe to admit that they had entirely overlooked the possibility, and spentbillions, and wasted years in the development of other technologies, and thebuilding of huge and costly enrichment plants based upon them, while a much lesscostly, much more efficient, but much more sophisticated and thereforehard-to-develop technology was inherent in quantum mechanics all along, rightalong with nuclear fission itself.But there are, in fact, other mysteries from Nazi Germany and World War II that,examined within the context and by means of the lens of laser isotopeenrichment, begin to make a great deal of sense. And these things in turn tendto corroborate more fully the circumstantial case being advanced for its actualexistence in a rudimentary form within Nazi Germany.1. VAST QUANTITIES OF ENRICHED URANIUM IN NAZI GERMANY IMPLIED BY THE EVIDENCEThe first of these mysteries is the apparently huge amount of uranium ore thatthe Nazis not only possessed, but the large amount of 235U which they actuallyenriched. In my book Reich of the Black Sun I noted that as late as December of1944, an official Manhattan Project document from the chief metallurgist as LosAlamos indicated that American stocks of fissile weapons-grade uranium-235 werestill far short of the needed critical mass for a workable atom bomb.388[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-388] Nor would America,according to the memorandum, have enough of the material for a uranium-fueledbomb at its then current production rates until November of 1945!But curiously, within a matter of mere weeks after the German surrender, thestocks and output of Oakridge of the precious material doubled. As I pointed outthere, this tore yet another gaping hole in the postwar Allied Legend aboutAmerican nuclear physics mastery and German nuclear engineering incompetence:If the stocks of weapons grade uranium ca. late 1944-early 1945 were about halfof what (the Americans) needed to be after two years of research andproduction…how then did the Manhattan Project acquire the large amount ofuranium-235 needed in the few months from March to the dropping of the LittleBoy bomb on Hiroshima in August, only five months away? How did it accomplishthis feat, if in fact after some three years of production it had only producedless than half of the needed supply of critical mass weapons grade uranium?Where did its missing uranium-235 come from?...Of course the answer is that if the Manhattan Project was incapable of producingenough enriched uranium in that short amount of time — months rather than years— then its stocks had to have been supplemented from external sources, and thereis only one viable place with the necessary technology to enrich uranium on thatscale… That source was Nazi Germany.389[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-389]In support of this contention I produced evidence that the German U-boat, U234,which had surrendered to American authorities, contained eighty gold-linedcylinders of what the evidence suggested was most likely highly enricheduranium-235.There were two significant facts that supported this contention. First, the twoJapanese officers accompanying the precious cargo from Germany to Japan wereseen painting paper labels on each of the cylinders, which simply read “U235.”And secondly, gold was used to shield only highly enriched U235, since, as anon-corrosive metal, it would not have corrupted or reduced the purity of thestock.390 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-390] In would thusappear that the U234 was transporting the entire critical mass of uranium-235 toJapan for a bomb, for the cylinders contained about 560 kg of the uranium oxide,more than enough for a critical mass for several bombs!391[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-391]This means that Nazi Germany was enriching uranium on a massive scale, and togreat purity. The question is: how?But there is an even deeper mystery surrounding Nazi Germany’s uranium stocks.As I also noted in Reich of the Black Sun:Germany too appears to have suffered the “missing uranium syndrome” in the finaldays prior to and immediately after the end of the war. But the problem inGermany’s case is that the missing uranium is not a few tens of kilos, butseveral hundred tons. At this juncture, it is worth citing Carter Hydrick’sexcellent research at length, in order to exhibit the full ramifications of thisproblem:“From June of 1940 to the end of the war, Germany seized 3,500 tons of uraniumcompounds from Belgium — almost three times the amount (Manhattan Project chiefGeneral Leslie) Groves had purchased…. and stored it in salt mines inStrassfurt, Germany. Groves brags that on 17 April, 1945, as the war was windingdown, Alsos recovered some 1,100 tons of uranium ore from Strassfurt and anadditional 31 tons in Toulouse, France…. And he claims that the amount recoveredwas all that Germany had ever held, asserting, therefore, that Germany never hadenough raw material to process the uranium either for a plutonium reactor pileor through magnetic separation techniques.“Obviously, if Strassfurt once held 3,500 tons and only 1,130 were recovered,some 2,370 tons of uranium ore was unaccounted for — still twice the amount theManhattan Project possessed and is assumed to have used throughout its entirewartime effort…. The material has not been accounted for to this day….“As early as the summer of 1941, according to historian Margaret Gowing, Germanyhad already refined 600 tons of uranium to its oxide form, the form required forionizing the material into a gas, in which form the uranium isotopes could thenbe magnetically or thermally separated or the oxide could be reduced to a metalfor a reactor pile. In fact, Professor Dr. Riehl, who was responsible for alluranium throughout Germany during the course of the war, says the figure wasactually much higher….“To create either a uranium or plutonium bomb, at some point uranium must bereduced to metal. In the case of plutonium, U238 is metalicized. Because ofuranium’s difficult characteristics, however, this metallurgical process is atricky one. The United States struggled with the problem early and still was notsuccessful reducing uranium to its metallic form in large production quantitiesuntil late in 1942. The German technicians, however… by the end of 1940 hadalready processed 280.6 kilograms into metal, over a quarter of a ton.”392[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-392]I then noted thatThese observations require some additional commentary.First, it is to be noted that Nazi Germany, by the best available evidence, wasmissing approximately two thousand tons of unrefined uranium ore by the war’send. Where did this ore go?Second, it is clear that Nazi Germany was enriching uranium on a massive scale,having refined 600 tons to oxide form for potential metalicization as early as1940. This would require a large and dedicated effort, with thousands oftechnicians, and a commensurately large facility or facilities to accomplish theenrichment. The figures, in other words, tend to corroborate the hypothesis…thatthe I.G. Farben “Buna” factory at Auschwitz was not a Buna factory at all, but ahuge uranium enrichment facility. However, the date would imply another suchfacility, located elsewhere, since the Auschwitz facility did not really beginproduction until sometime in 1942 .393[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-393]There are two significant things to note here: first, Hydrick’s reference to thevaporization of uranium to an ionized gas, and secondly, the fact that large-scale uranium separation is occurring inside of Nazi Germany prior to theAuschwitz facility coming on line in early 1942.The problem is, there is no other such large facility in all the Third Reich orits conquered territories prior to this period. The absence of such a largefacility thus implies the existence of a sophisticated technology, capable ofproducing such stocks of enriched uranium rather quickly and efficiently withoutthe need for deployment in large numbers.We already know what the most likely technology that would be capable of doingthat is…2. THE ALLEGED TEST OF A SMALL CRITICAL MASS HIGH-YIELD NUCLEAR DEVICE ATOHRDRUF IN MARCH, 1945There is, however, yet another piece of evidence that points to the existence ofa highly sophisticated technology of isotope separation inside of Nazi Germanyduring the war, and this is the alleged detonation of a small critical mass — anextremely small critical mass — atom bomb of highly efficient levels of yield atthe troop parade ground of Orhdruf, in the Harz Mountains of Thuringia in southcentral Germany on March 4, 1945. Significantly, Adolf Hitler himself waspresent in the area during the period of the test.What concerns us here is that the test, according to some German sources,involved the detonation of a device with a critical mass of a mere 100 grams.This fact led me to speculate in Reich of the Black Sun that at least one of theprocesses that this test, if it really occurred, had to have employed was“boosted fission,” a technique whereby some neutron emitting source is dopedinto the critical mass to yield an extra burst of fast thermal neutrons into thereaction cascade that would not result from the splitting of the critical massitself. This process served several purposes, for it allowed (1) a lowercritical mass, (2) a higher yield for a smaller investment of material, or, toput it more bluntly and clearly, more bang for the Reichsmark. Under itsordinary uses it also would allow for a slightly lower level of purity of thecritical mass of fissile material to be used.394[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-394]But the extraordinarily small mass for the Orhdruf test — a mere 100 grams! —was far below any weight, even with ultra-pure 235U, that could cause an atomicexplosion. As I pointed out in my next book on Nazi secret weapons, The SSBrotherhood of the Bell, this fact meant that the bomb had to have been fueledby extraordinarily pure plutonium, and moreover, plutonium that was boosted viathe boosting process. However, this introduced a new problematical factor intothe equation, for plutonium can only be synthesized in a nuclear reactor, andaccording to the Allied Legend and the known evidence, all known German attemptsto construct an atomic pile were highly unsuccessful, due either to failures inthe moderators, or design factors, or both.This led me to speculate that if the Orhdruf test did take place — and theevidence on the ground to this day in Germany suggests clearly that it did —then there had to have been a hidden and unknown functional reactor technologyinside of Nazi Germany or its allies at a fairly early date, a technology thatthe postwar Allies have kept hidden to this day, or that they simply did notever discover. And this technology was producing plutonium. I then speculated ontwo possible sources.The first was that the Germans actually built a methane-moderated reactor, forsuch had actually been proposed in 1941(!) by German physicists Fritz Houtermansand Manfred Baron Von Ardenne for the express purpose of manufacture of “element94,” plutonium. And at that point in history, plutonium had only one practicaluse: as fuel for an atom bomb.But there is another source for a possible functioning reactor technology usinggraphite as a moderator, and I only briefly mentioned it in The SS Brotherhoodof the Bell, and that source is Fascist Italy. It was Enrico Fermi’s homeuniversity, after all, the University of Milan, which had taken out the Italianpatent for just such a reactor in 1938, and it was indeed on the basis of thatdesign that Fermi built his first atomic pile in the squash courts of theUniversity of Chicago for the Manhattan Project! While there is to my knowledgeno evidence to support the notion that Fascist Italy had a functioning atomicpile, by the same token, if it did, once again the victorious Allies would havebeen loathe to disclose the fact.A functioning Italian atomic pile also presents certain possible resolutions toother operational mysteries of the war, which must be mentioned here beforeresuming our circumstantial case of some rudimentary laser isotope enrichmenttaking place inside of Nazi Germany. First, as many military commentators havenoticed, the entire Allied invasion of Italy and the subsequent long, slow,hard-fought campaign against Field Marshal Kesselring’s forces seem militarilyinexplicable. A direct Allied invasion of the Balkans — as Churchill himselfadvocated — would have paid the Western Allies far larger operational dividends.So, might the ultimate rationalization for what is otherwise a militarilyinexplicable invasion be, in fact, a very successful Italian atomic pileprogram? Possibly.395 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-395]There is one other thing that a successful Italian atomic pile program mightalso help to explain, and that is simply the case of the several hundreds oftons of missing uranium from Nazi Germany. One place it might have gone wouldhave been precisely Italy, the nation whose scientists had designed the firstworkable large-scale atomic reactor.All this speculation, however, leaves one problem about the Ohrdruf test to beexplained. That something unusual was exploded there, there is no doubt. Thequestion is whether or not it was, as some German researchers now maintain, aboosted fission device, for even if one admits that possibility, it not onlyrequires plutonium and hence a functioning reactor, but once one has synthesizedplutonium, one must then separate enough Pu239, the isotope needed for a bomb,to extraordinarily high purity in order for a boosted fission bomb of only 100grams critical mass of fuel to be possible. One must have, in other words, atechnology capable of separation of isotope vastly more efficient than diffusiongates and mass spectrographs.Something like laser isotope enrichment.3. THE THORIUM AND RADIUM MYSTERIESAn even greater mystery from World War II is the fact that when the Allies’“Alsos” intelligence teams entered the Reich, antennae pulsing with suspicion,snouts to the ground sniffing out any clue or lead into the nature of Germany’satom bomb project, one of the most unusual things they encountered was theextreme German interest in thorium, and the extreme lengths the Nazis went toscour all of occupied Europe for every last granule of the element. It was — andis — a mystery, because no one knows what the Germans were doing with it. AsNazi secret weapons researcher Igor Witkowski puts it: “The U.S. Alsos missionwas unable to explain the high role of thorium in the German research,”396[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-396] a statement calling intoquestion once again the postwar Allied Legend concerning their own nuclearsuperiority, for if they were so superior, why can they not explain thismystery?Witkowski suggests a wider context, however, in which to view it, one which willlead us, finally, back to the Nazi Bell project and its mysterious and“alchemical” Serum 525. In a personal communication to this author, Mr.Witkowski graciously shared with me the latest results of his continuingresearch on Nazi secret weapons, research that will be incorporated assupplements to the pending German publication of his magisterial book in Englishon Nazi secret weapons, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe. In an extendedsupplemental commentary to be added to the end of his chapter on Nazi nuclearweapons research, he appends the following new information for the Germanedition. It is presented here, with thanks to Mr. Witkowski for allowing me toshare it with an English-speaking audience:Compartmentalization was one of the reasons why the subject of German nuclearactivities was not comprehended, but there was another one too — because some ofthe most important facilties were located in the East — in the future Sovietsphere of interest, which proved to be a very significant “obstacle” for Westernresearchers….Recent archival searches have revealed however the existence ofother, similar places. Even more important ones, for in the case of the twopresented below, the allied intelligence reports described them not as “workingon nuclear technology” etc., but expressis verbis as the ones in which thenuclear weapons were manufactured or developed.In one of the reports there is a description of a secret camouflaged undergroundfacility near the town of Sagan, in Niederschlesien:“German soldiers reported on Aug. 1 that 15km from Sagan, on a bearing of 120˚there is an underground factory in the woods with an aerodrome. Factorypresumably manufacturing an atom bomb, rumored to be a new weapon. An aerodromenear Sagan is reported (to be) in process of conversion to experimentalproduction.”Another report seems to be even more interesting, this time pertaining to apreviously unknown research team under the control of Werner Heisenberg (!),formed on the basis of scientists from Dresden:“University of Dresden: Said to be the heart of German development of the secretweapons. At the University of Dresden a group of chemists and engineers, andprofessors are working under the direction of Heisenberg…on by-products ofradium at the Schicht mines in Aussig near radium mines at Jachymov in theProtektorate.”Jachymov (St. Joachimsthal) was, on the other hand, one of the main exploitationareas in the former Reichsprotektorat der Böhmen und Mahren397[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-397] in which the Red Army teamsworked later on. In this case, an entire battalion was dispatched by Smersh,398[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-398] supported by unspecifiedtechnical groups.Only recently has it turned out that their aim was to obtain the German nuclearbombs. Apart from the “revealed” role of Heisenberg and his Dresden team, themention of “by-products of radium” may be equally important. It’s hard not toset it up with another bit of information: the cargo transported by a Japanesesubmarine (I-29) which left the base in Lorient on the 16th of April 1944,heading to Penang in today’s Indonesia. According to accessible sources ittransported, among others, an “amalgam of mercury and radium.”….It’s hard to resist a suspicion that these two cases are manifestations ofsome high-priority and still largely unknown nuclear project — German as well asJapanese .399 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-399]This important quotation contains a number of highly significant clues and bitsof information.First, as Witkowski indicates, more recently discovered archival materialindicates that Heisenberg was leading a team of chemists, engineers andprofessors at the University of Dresden. Such a team, with Heisenberg in charge,one of the founders of quantum mechanics itself, would be precisely the type ofteam needed to develop and deploy a laser-based isotope enrichment technology.Secondly, the fact that it is the University of Dresden that is involved ishighly significant. For as the only major university besides that of Breslau inLower Silesia that is close to the rats’ run of huge SS underground factoriesand bunkers that stretched from the Harz region of south-central Germany downthrough the curve of Silesia to Breslau, the presence of such a team there underHeisenberg’s control — and the fact that its existence if not its function wereat least known to the Allies — finally gives a military rationalization to oneof the most barbarous atrocities ever committed: the firebombing of Dresden andthe horrifying loss of civilian life, under brutal circumstances, toward the endof the war. The Allied bombing, otherwise morally reprehensible andindefensible, has the inexplicable air of desperation about it, one thatWitkowski’s information implies might have had a very secret and covert militaryreason behind it.Thirdly, note that with the mention of radium and its “by-products” we have anindicator of Nazi interest in yet another radioactive material. Putting all theprevious information together, we are now confronted by a massive dilemma: theNazis are showing extreme interest not only in uranium-235 and plutonium-239, anormal interest for any nation pursuing an atom bomb, but in thorium and radium“by-products”, i.e., isotopes, as well. And that wide range of interest impliesonce again the existence of a technology flexible enough to separate isotopes ofseveral different elements, if that is indeed what the Nazis were up to withthese “by-products.” That technology is, once again, laser isotope separation.Even if they were only interested in these materials for the purpose of a speedyproduction of a “dirty” radiological bomb, the means to enrich enough deadlymaterial still had to exist in order for a radiological bomb to be a practicalweapon. This too implies the necessity for a flexible technology of isotopeseparation.4. THE LASER MYSTERYAs we have seen, the Farm Hall Transcripts contain suggestive remarks indicatingthe possibility of the development of a laser technology inside the Third Reicheither before or during the war. The remarks furthermore found not onlycorroboration in the research of British journalist Tom Agoston, but heexplicitly stated that this was one area that the SS was actually experimentingin. But is there any other corroborating data?There not only is corroboration, but it too reveals the depths to which Naziscience had actually penetrated, going far beyond the accomplishments of theWestern Allies or the Soviets even long after the end of the war.On the 16th of November, 1944, a secret war department document addressed toMajor F.J. Smith from Lt. Colonel Merillate Moses, stated the following:g) Experiments with “Death Rays” were conducted by AEG Seimensstadt Berlin atTempelhof in 1939. Guinea pigs were killed at a distance of 200 meters.h) An individual employed “on electrical matters,” not named, or otherwisedescribed, told the prisoner that the Germans had for years been experimentingwith these death rays.i) It is believed that it is a sort of magnetic beam, capable of stopping themotors of planes at a great distance.j) Experiments of which he knew, (1) destroying the functions of aircraft motorswith induced magnetic fields, (2) exploding aircraft in the air by directultra-violet ray.k) This weapon which emits waves or rays based on piezoelectricity is adevelopment of the death ray.400[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-400] It is known that tests weremade in 1938 and that at a distance of eight hundred meters an automobile motorwas successfully stopped.401[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-401]Observe that according to this American War Department document, actualexperiments began on automobiles and such ca. 1938 and 1939, indicating thateven earlier proof of concept experiments were probably performed.While the secret weapon project being described here is obviously not a laser,there is a suggestive reference to “piezoelectrics” which might once againindicate the use of a crystal for the solid state optical cavity of a laser.Shades of Horst Korsching’s remarks about artificial rubies in the Farm Halltranscripts!Finally, notice the firm involved: AEG, or the Allgemeine ElekstrisitätsGemeinschaft, the very same firm that built the power plant of the Bell, underthe direction of future NASA administrator Dr. Kurt Debus!402[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-402]But it gets worse.According to Witkowski, Nazi research was researching X-ray and gamma raylasers:…among other things work was carried out on some kind of “X-ray laser” — asource of coherent X-ray or gamma radiation….025 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_025_r1.gif]German Luftwaffe Document Referring to X-Ray and Gamma Ray Laser Research:Courtesy of Igor Witkowski and The Truth About the WunderwaffeThanks to searches carried out in German archives, it has been possible toestablish that in 1944 a special Luftwaffe research establishment received thetask to develop such a weapon, situated in the town of Gross Ostheim. Materialsrelating to this work are currently located in a civilian establishment — theKarlsruhe research centre (Foruschungszentrum Karlsruhe) and were disclosedseveral years ago…The third and most mature version of the weapon assumed theirradiation of a target 5 kilometers away at a rate of 7 rads a second for 30seconds which, as affirmed in the report, was completely sufficient to totallyparalyze the aircraft’s crew.403[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-403]But what is more interesting is something that Witkowski does not mention, andit occurs in the actual document itself.I have displayed on the previous page the actual document itself that Witkowskirefers to, because its contents are so astounding that one might be inclined tobelieve I made it up, unless the actual document were shown. Before getting tothe actual contents of the document itself, there are two important points toremember when reading it.The first is that in the 1940s, the term laser, standing for “lightamplification by stimulated emission of radiation,” had not yet even beencoined. So the Germans, if they are indeed researching lasers, will have todescribe the concept and principle operative in a laser, namely, a suddencascade of photon radiation emission. The second point is equally crucial.Recall that Richard C. Hoagland, when he proposed his “laser isotope separation”interpretation of the Farm Hall Transcript comments, also indicated that somesort of documentary proof was needed that the Germans had worked out the theory.As this document indicates, they not only had worked out the theory, but hadgone beyond mere optical solid state lasers, i.e., a first generation of thetechnology, but were already thinking in terms of lasing in the high-frequencyrange of deadly X-rays and even deadlier gamma rays.With these points in mind, on to the translation of the document itself:Brief Report concerning the Works, which was performed by the undersigned andhis co-workers at the Institute for X-Ray-Related Natural and Raw MaterialResearch, since April 20, 1943, under the scope of the Research Directive DE6224/0109/43.1.

Proposal for an installation for the manufacture of high voltage and largecurrent intensity according to the Cascade Principle as a basis of a single DRP.Leipzig, May 4, 1994 /s/ Prof. Dr. E. SchieboldWhat is evident from the document, regardless of how one translates certainnuances — which is difficult without the rest of the context!–is that certainpassages are starkly unambiguous in their implications, not the least of whichis the final point which mentions the “Cascade Principle,” the very principleutilized in lasers. Notably, the way the point is phrased, taken in the contextof the rest of the preceding document, indicates that some proof-of-conceptdesign and testing had already taken place, and that the project was moving intofull-scale equipment design and testing.Additionally, point number 16 indicates where the German project is heading, foratmospheric propagation and distortion effects would certainly be of concern tothe Luftwaffe in the deployment of any type of laser.What is also highly significant is the name of the inventor ascribed to the“ray-transformer”: Wideröe. As mentioned before, the name is Norwegian, notGerman, and is in fact the name of one of the pioneers in particle acceleratordesign and development: Rolf Wideröe. Wideröe had in fact built a first linearresonance particle accelerator at the Rhenische-Westfalen Technische Universitätin Aachen, Germany, in 1928. Wideröe’s work in particle accelerators, which hecalled the “ray-transformer,” was crucial in the technology tree leading to thecyclotron.409 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-409]The document thus seems to suggest that the Nazis were attempting somecombination of the linear resonance particle accelerator developed by Wideröe aspossibly the pumping mechanism for an X-ray laser based upon the cascadeprinciple operative in lasers. Thus, the Germans had not only apparently donethe theory, but were developing large scale equipment. Moreover, the use of aresonance accelerator suggests the highly speculative possibility that theGermans were also thinking in terms of a tunable laser.There is one final important point about the document that suggests that theproject was more than theoretical, but concerned with the practical developmentand implementation of equipment on a large scale based on ideas and prototypesthat had already passed the proof-of-concept phase of development, and that isthat the document is a dull, boring “talking points” briefing paper outliningthe points to be covered in a briefing with an unnamed Luftwaffe field marshal!Clearly, if one is shopping for installations of 1.2, 2.2, and ultimately 15million volts, one is beyond the small laboratory efforts and into a moreserious phase of the project.D. A TENTATIVE CONCLUSIONWe have already noted Witkowksi’s reference to that curiously “alchemical” cargobeing carried by a Japanese submarine, a cargo consisting of an amalgam ofradium and mercury! This is the strongest circumstantial clue as to what mighthave comprised the chemical recipe of the Nazi Bell’s mysterious “IRR Xerum525.” Might the heavy interest of the Nazis in radium and thorium — an interestthat seems at the minimum as great as their interest in the fuels for an atombomb, uranium and plutonium — be because these and possibly other elements werenecessary ingredients in the chemical recipe of the Bell’s “Xerum 525”?This question is a crucial one, because Xerum 525, as described in SS generalJacob Sporrenberg’s war crimes trial affidavit in Poland, resembles no compoundmore than it does “Red Mercury” and the alchemists’ “tincture of antimony,” bothin its alchemical “reddish-purple” color, and in its state as a very dense,liquid goo that, like the various materials tested in Kozyrev’s experiments, wassubjected to a variety of stress by being spin and electrically pulsed.But that is the story of another chapter. For now, we may conclude as a highlyspeculative though plausible possibility, that Mr. Hoagland’s hypothesis of someversion of laser isotope separation has a great deal of circumstantial evidenceto support it. And the strange and almost “alchemical” combination oftechnologies suggested by the Luftwaffe document prompts an important question:What, exactly, was the role and influence of alchemy inside of Nazi Germany, andmore importantly, inside of the Nazi party itself. And what role, if any, mightit have played in the conceptualization of the Bell?Get a strong cup of coffee, breathe deeply, sit down, and brace yourself…!"},{"pageContent":"11THE GREATER GERMAN ALCHEMICAL REICH THE GOLDMAKER, THE GOLD, GERLACH, AND“HIMMLER’S RASPUTIN”026 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_026_r1.jpg]“Primal law: ‘Above as below, below as above!’ Therefore in the middle there isa neutral force — (i.e., generational-) field!”Jarl Widar, a.k.a. Weisthor, a.k.a. SS Brigadier General Karl Maria Wiligut410[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-410] During the 1920s and the early 1930s prior to the Nazi assumption of power,Germany was a veritable cauldron of alchemical ferment and other occult andesoteric activity. This phenomenon has spawned a plethora of books on thesubject of Nazism and the occult, some more, and some less, scholarly, but allmore of less coming to the same conclusion: there was, to whatever debatableextent, at least some degree of influence of esoteric and occult doctrines inthe formation of the Nazi Party and later of the Nazi Reich.Curiously, few of those studies have paid much more than passing attention tothe role that alchemy as an esoteric discipline played in those formations. Theomission is peculiar because, as we shall see, one rather infamous alchemicalepisode involving high-level and influential Nazis even caused something of amajor scandal in the ailing Weimar Republic, a scandal that even drewinternational attention and a few articles in Time magazine and the New YorkTimes. The affair is made even more curious because it occurred in more or lessthe same time period that one of Germany’s, and indeed the world’s, mostrespected and capable physicists was writing a newspaper article for the generalpublic in which the possibility of alchemy is mentioned quite explicitly. Thesefacts not only make the lack of serious interest in the subject of alchemyinside of Weimar and Nazi Germany curious, but make more curious the evengreater absence in the literature of any serious attempt to draw connectionsbetween alchemy and physics.But the question demands our attention.Why would senior and influential Nazis be drawn into a self-evidently fraudulentscheme to turn base metals into gold? And why would a prominent,internationally-known and respected German Nobel Laureate physicist be writingan article in a widely-circulated German newspaper about alchemy being a seriousreality? And even more importantly, what are the connections, if any, betweenthe two?To answer these questions, it is best to begin the story in the middle, and workour way backward to the scandal, and forward to Nazi Germany’s most highlyclassified secret weapons project: the Bell, and its precisely alchemical “Serum525.”A. THE STRANGE CASE AND ALCHEMICAL BELIEFS OF “HIMMLER’S RASPUTIN”: SS BRIGADIERGENERAL KARL MARIA WILIGUTMany people are vaguely aware that the Nazis had at least some sort of occultand esoteric influence at work not only in the formulation of their ideology,but in the actual structuring and policy formation of the Nazi state, the ThirdReich. Fewer people have actually studied the matter, but those who have tend toassign this influence to a now typical cast of characters and secret societiesmoving in the background, helping to midwife the Nazi Party into existence: theThulegesellschaft and its own alleged roots in the esoteric, occult, and rabidlypan-Germanic groups that flourished in pre-World War I imperial Germany, andmore importantly, imperial Austria.411[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-411] On the basis of aconsiderable circumstantial case, many of these in turn have speculated thatHitler himself was initiated into one or more or these groups. Yet, thedocumentary proof of this has never been forthcoming.One of the primary sources for this belief was, of course, Baron Rudolf VonSebottendorff’s publication prior to World War II of his now somewhat infamousbook, Bevor Hitler Kam (Before Hitler Came), a book that so infuriated the Nazigovernment once it was in power that they put it on their “index,” prohibitedpublication, and attempted to round up as many copies as they could.027 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_027_r1.gif]Cover, Inside Cover, and Frontispiece from Baron Rudolf Von Sebottendorff’sBevor Hitler KamPart of the reason may lie in the fact that, according to Von Sebottendorff, theinfluence of the Thulegesellschaft on the Nazi Party’s formation and ritual waspervasive, even to the use of its symbols, including the swastika, as thepictures on the previous pages demonstrate, as well as its forms of greeting,including, of course, the Nazi “Sieg Heil!” salute and extended arm.412[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-412]A more important reason for the ban on the work, however, must surely lie in thelists of its members that it contains, not only of prominent figures in thefuture Nazi State, including Nazi Party Reichsleiter and occultist dabblerRudolf Hess, but prominent, very wealthy and powerful, backers, such as HeilaCountess Von Westrapp, then Secretary of the society, and the powerful andwealthy Von Thurn-und-Taxis family, in the person of Gustav Franz Maria PrinceVon Thurn-und-Taxis, as shown on the “honor roll” list of the society’s “martyrsand confessors” on the next page.Sebottendorff also provides the clue, however, to something else, and that isthe possible exact relationship between the SS, its esoteric “culture,” and thehighly advanced paradigm of physics it was investigating with the Bell. Thatlink is “Himmler’s Rasputin,” SS Brigadier General Karl Maria Wiligut, a.k.a.Weisthor. With recent scholarly publications, we are now also in a position tosee the possible connection of alchemy to the SS’ esoteric culture and itsadvanced physics projects via the various conceptions entertained by Wiligut,and passed on to Himmler.In order to appreciate the significance of these speculations, however, one mustplace them against the background of the basic conclusions concerning therelationship of the Nazis to the pre-Third Reich secret societies, a connectionthat has been the more or less basic prevailing view within scholarship sincethe end of the war. This view maintains, on the basis of the numerouscircumstantial connections between personnel, beliefs, and rituals ofThulegesllschaft and other such societies in the pre-Nazi era and the Nazi Partyitself, and its rituals, beliefs and policies, that the influence was direct andimmediate. Such studies often point in turn to the influence on theThulegesellschaft of the pre-World War I pan-Germanic esoteric orders andteachings originating from Vienna, and the Order of New Templars, or as it isalso known, the Order of the New Temple (ONT) of Lanz Von Liebenfels, hisrabidly racist views and racially-based reconstructions of history in his Ostaramagazine. While this is not the place for a detailed rehearsal of all thesescholarly views,413 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-413] oneimpression they invariably convey is that this relationship ran directly toHitler, and on that basis, such researchers often speculate that he was actuallyan initiate into one or more of these three esoteric societies and influences.But as will now be shown, the influence is at one and the same time both moreindirect and more direct, for it is mediated not by any one of these societiesto Adolf Hitler, but by one man — Karl Maria Wiligut, “Himmler’s Rasputin” — andnot to Hitler and the Nazi Party as a whole, but to Himmler and the SS as aninstitution within the Nazi Party and State. As such, it is less accurate tospeak of an occult influence on the entire Nazi State, as it is to speak of anesoteric influence at the uppermost levels of the command structure of the SS.One is, so to speak, dealing with a Black Reich within the Reich, and at theuppermost reaches of the SS, with a very secret esoteric, and specificallyalchemical, belief system.1. HIMMLER’S RASPUTINA. BRIEF BIOGRAPHYWiligut was born on the 10th of December 1866 to an Austrian army officer, and,following in his father’s footsteps, enrolled in the Imperial Cadet School atVienna-Breitensee in 1880, and by 1913, one year before the outbreak of WorldWar I, had been promoted to the rank of major, reaching the rank of colonel bythe war’s end after serving with some distinction in the Imperial army on theEastern Front. On the breakup of the ustro-Hungarian Empire in 1919, he took upresidence in Salzburg.414 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-414]It was during the period prior to World War I that Wiligut also began thepublishing of esoteric works that would make him a well-known esoteric scholarand garner him a certain amount of respect and renown in German-speaking occultcircles.Around 1908 Wiligut came into contact with Lanz Von Liebenfels’ Order of the NewTemple, most likely being introduced to it “by his cousin, Willy Thaler, who wasa member of the Liebenfels circle”415[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-415] and thus entered the milieuof “esoteric nationalism” permeating the occult secret societies of postwarAustria and Germany.A brief word is necessary about Von Liebenfels and his historical and racialideas, for they are to some extent paralleled in those of Wiligut, though thedegree of influence on the latter is a matter for debate. According toSebottendorff and his exposé of Thule Society influence on the Nazis, VonLiebenfels, a former Roman Catholic monk, had — through his knowledge of earlyChristian patristic literature — reconstructed what he believed to have been theactual early text of the New Testament416[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-416] as a component of a largerprogram of historical revisionism based in part on the Theosophical beliefs ofHelena Petrovna Blavatsky, in which various “root races” gradually declined froma golden age past to mankind’s current decadent condition. In Von Liebenfels’hands, this decline was due to the racial corruption of the “pure Aryan” lineageof a white Teutonic race by intermingling of the cultures and blood of inferiorraces, such as — predictably enough — the Jews. Von Liebenfels published hisviews in a notorious book entitled Theozoologie which had, as its raciallyslurring subtitle, On Sodom’s Monkeys. While most scholars of the subject pointout the parallel between Von Liebenfels’ racial beliefs and those of the Nazis,few take note of the larger view of history in which they are cast, namely, thatthere was, eons ago and predating the known classical civilizations of Sumer andEgypt by millennia, a previously existing Very High Civilization. It is thisview, as will be seen in a moment, that is paralleled in the esoteric system ofWiligut, with its own peculiar twists. Thus it is Wiligut, not Von Liebenfels,who actually exercises a direct influence on Himmler, the SS, and itsleadership.In any case, after his retirement from the Austrian army and move to Salzburg in1919, Wiligut “seems to have immersed himself in esoteric studies.”417[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-417] It was during this periodthat Wiligut came to his own version of esoteric “higher biblical criticism” andreconstruction” of Christian history, maintaining that “the Bible had originatedin Germany, and through mistranslation and intentional misrepresentation it hadbeen revised into its present form.”418[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-418] In this he parallels VonLiebenfels.Wiligut quickly became involved in the post-World War I right-wing politics ofAustria and Germany, editing a journal called Der eiserne Besen (The IronBroom), a journal that like Baron Von Sebottendorff’s later ThuleSociety-sponsored Völkischer Beobachter (People’s Observer) — the newspaper thateventually became the Nazi Party’s “official newspaper”! — had as its goal toexpose “the conspiracies of the Jews, Freemasons and Roman Catholics (especiallythe Jesuits).”419 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-419] Duringthis period his marriage began to fail, leading to his wife ultimately, andsuccessfully, getting him declared mentally incompetent and confined to a mentalinstitution in 1924.420 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-420]Even during this period of confinement, however, Wiligut managed to maintaincontact with members and acquaintances within the Order of the New Temple.Eventually released from the asylum in 1927, Wiligut remained in Salzburg andreceived visitors both from Austria and Germany anxious to seek his esotericexpertise, especially from the esoteric German Edda Society. It was during oneof these visits during 1932 that he received Fräulein Frieda Dorenberg, a memberof the National Socialist Party, and herself “deeply involved in esotericmatters” as well as being a member of the Edda Society.421[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-421] Smuggled into Germany laterthat year, Wiligut assumed the pen name Jarl Widar and published importantesoteric articles — about which more later — in the esoteric journal Hagal.These contacts and articles gained him a great deal of notoriety and respect inGerman occult circles, and as a result, one year later, after the Naziassumption of power, Wiligut met Reichsführer SS Himmler at an esotericconference. A short time later, Wiligut joined the SS in September of 1933 underthe pseudonym Karl Maria Weisthor, and thereby his career as “Himmler’sRasputin” began.422 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-422]Two months later “Wiligut was officially appointed head of the Department forPre- and Early History, within the Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt (Main Office forRace and Settlement)” in Munich, and it was in this capacity that a “closerrelationship developed between Himmler and his new adviser on ancienttraditions.”423 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-423] By 1935,continuing to publish in Hagal, WiligutWeisthor had become such a close adviserto Himmler that he was moved to Berlin and given his own villa.While Wiligut’s work to some extent paralleled that of the notorious SSAhnenerbedienst, “his work was essentially separate from that office. Wiligutworked for Himmler personally, whereas the Ahnenerbe was part of a much largerstructure subject to more objective academic standards.”424[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-424] So important andinfluential was Wiligut during this period that he was instrumental in theselection and design of Himmler’s infamous SS “Order Castle” at Wewelsburg, inthe actual design of the SS ring, and the creation of SS rituals, that he issueda “steady stream of reports on esoteric matters of theology, history andcosmology…for the most part directly to Himmler.”425[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-425] This will become quite thecrucial point once we start examining the particulars of Wiligut’s esoteric, andvery alchemical, beliefs.By 1938, however, Wiligut had also garnered powerful enemies within the SS,among them the powerful chief of Himmler’s personal staff, SS General Wolff,426[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-426] who discovered the facts ofWiligut’s mental commitment, and eventually forced him to retire from the SS in1939. Wiligut spent the rest of the war moving, or being moved, from onelocation or SS retirement house to another. Being interred at the end of the warfor a short time by the British, he eventually was released, eventually wound upin Arlosen in 1945, where he suffered a severe stroke, and died on Jan 3,1946.427 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-427]028 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_028_r1.jpg]Karl Maria Wiligut,“Himmler’s Rasputin”B. AND THE SS AHNENERBEDIENSTAs was seen, Wiligut had, as far as is known, no direct contact with the SS’“occult and esoteric research” bureau, the Ahnenerbediest. But as both had adirect influence upon the formation of the esoteric culture of the SS andHimmler himself, a short review of some of the Ahnenerbe’s principal beliefs,set in the wider context of the “occult revival” that took place in WeimarGermany between the wars is in order.(1) THE AHNENERBE, “ATLANTIS,” AND ESOTERIC GEOPOLITICSWhen Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler decreed the creation of the SSAhnenerbedienst in 1935, one of its department objectives was the scientific andarchaeological study of esoteric and ancient lore, legends, and myths, with thegoal of the application of any military potential these may have held. In acertain sense, Himmler had willed into existence an entire governmentbureaucracy to do nothing but military studies of the esoteric, all under hispersonal control. This created an unusual if not unique first in modern history,because for the first time in modern history a technologically andscientifically sophisticated great power was acknowledging, even if covertly,the existence of a very ancient Very High Civilization whose science it wasintent upon recovering. Himmler had decreed, in effect, that the Third Reich wasnot only going to look for a “paleoancient Very High Civilization,” for“Atlantis,” but more importantly, for its science.Thus, while Wiligut’s connection to the Ahnenerbe was such that he was never amember of it, as one of Himmler’s closest prewar advisers, he could hardly havebeen unaware of it. Indeed, “he played an important role in ceptualizing anddesigning certain esoteric aims and practices of Himmler’s elite circle withinthe SS, and this factor alone makes Wiligut a fascinating and unique study.”428[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-428] Wiligut may thus havepossibly been an influencing factor on Himmler’s decision to create theAhnenerbedienst, for his own personal esoteric views were certainly in line withthose held and developed by SS Ahnenerbe leaders themselves. In fact, the firstdirector of the bureau, Herman Wirth, “deeply sympathized with pagantraditions.”429 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-429] Wirth, whobecame the Ahnenerbe director after Himmler’s decree of 1935 that created thebureau, not only “held a longstanding antipathy for Christianity” but made it apoint to promote his idea of a “pre-Christian Nordic-Atlantian … culture” withinthe bureau.430 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-430]Another esotericist with whom Wiligut had close contact was Günther Kirchhoff.While Kirchhoff’s views were rejected by the Ahnenerbe itself, Wiligut’sendorsement to Himmler was enough to win Kirchhoff Himmler’s ear, and as late as1944 he was still preparing reports on occult ideas for Himmler.431[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-431] Kirchhoff’s chief conceptthat seems to have sparked Himmler’s interest was the idea of an esotericgeomantic geopolitics based on his own unique conception of the world grid,i.e., the idea that certain ancient sites were laid out over “power points”designed to draw energy from the earth itself. On his view, this made Vienna thekey to controlling Asia, via certain power points in Asia connected via apattern of hexagons to the European city!432[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-432]In yet another such geomantic geopolitics promoted during this time, one musttake note of another idea promoted directly by Wiligut as a component of his“meta-history” of mankind. In Wiligut’s version, the god Teut, a Germanizationof the Egyptian god Thoth, made the Harz mountains of Germany a center of suchactivity. This may or may not be significant for our purposes, since the Harzregion, as is now widely known, became a center for the SS’ most secret andhighly classified secret weapons projects, being honeycombed with a variety ofunderground installations, laboratories, and factories. Indeed, the Harz region,along with lower Silesia, might justifiably be called the most crucial componentof SS General Hans Kammler’s secret weapons think tank headquartered at Pilsen.(2) THE AHNENERBE AND THE SCIENTIFIC DECODING OF ESOTERIC LOREOne of the most often commented upon, and yet paradoxically overlooked, aspectsof Ahnenerbe research was precisely its interest in ancient folklore:As the example of Herman Wirth demonstrates, the interests of some NationalSocialist and SS-Ahnenerbe academics ran strongly in the direction of folkloreand research into folk-symbols. This included medieval decorative arts,architectural styles…and runes. In literary fields this included folktales. In acertain sense such studies were sympathetic to paganism and also to a kind of“occult” knowledge — it required a trained mind and eye to rediscover and unlockthe ancient symbolic code which had been embedded in folk art, architecture, andlore…. But the obsession with symbolic motifs — and even their “occult” meanings— aside, the aim of this research was to bring such things back out into theopen, not to use them for arcane magical purposes. The ultimate goal was torediscover the repressed ancient national character and to instill in the peoplea sense of nationalistic pride and identity. The same trend and method had beenused in the nineteenth century to aid in the original forging of the Germanstate in 1871.433 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-433]Flowers and Moynihan, whose remarks these are, get it only partly right, namely,one purpose of the Ahnenerbe was precisely to find and popularly promote thepre-Christian and pre-Classical roots of the German Volk and Culture. But theyoverlook the ultimately military and covert purpose of the Ahnenerbe, whichReichsführer SS Himmler’s original decree discloses: the real, ultimate, andultimately covert purpose of the organization was to recover the ancient lostscience of that pre-existing “Atlantean” civilization, and the first step in therecovery of it is to decode its traces and remains in ancient texts, monuments,and symbols.As Wiligut himself would state it in a short article entitled “Zodiacal Signsand Constellations” that he authored for the esoteric journal Hagal under hispen name Jarl Widar:In Atlantean times, then, these original Aryan Runes had a deep meaning byvirtue of their logical ordering in the zodiacal signs, which was apparentlylost as soon as the meaning was changed in an astrologically illogical way as aresult of the variation brought on by the precession of the equinoxes….. So itwas only after the demise of the Atlantean cultural epoch that the zodiacalsigns and their written signs were transferred to the constellations of theecliptic. This caused that confusion of knowledge between the processes in thegreat solar year and those of a terrestrial year. This confusion is stillfundamentally in operation today. But with this knowledge the oldest culturaldocuments known to us can be measured and — viewed not from the perspective ofterrestrial years, but rather solar ones — these can lead us to correctknowledge of the ages.434 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-434]One must pause and carefully observe what sort of program Wiligut is actuallyengaged in here.First, there is the reference to a pre-classical “Atlantean” civilization,which, in Wiligut’s hands, comes to an abrupt end via some sort of cosmiccatastrophe. Second, this catastrophe he implies is “cosmic” in scale becausethe physics is not that of the solar system, measured in terrestrial years, butis truly a galacticallyscaled physics, because the “true year” of the zodiac isthe solar year, measured in terms of the precession of the equinoxes and itscourse through the signs of the zodiac, with each such year thus beingapproximately 25,000 terrestrial years in length! Finally, the runes, laid outin correspondence with this plan, evidence a logical development, an encodedphysics, of this phenomenon.In this, as any reader of my previous books beginning with The Giza Death Starup through The Cosmic War will notice, Wiligut is hardly doing anything unusual.But he is one of this first to view the significance of astrological lore from apurely scientific and astrophysics point of view, and to maintain, on thatbasis, that there is an encoded science and an encoded “meta-history” of thesolar system and of mankind within such lore. Small wonder, then, that he caughtthe attention of Himmler and gained such an important advisory position to theReichsführer!Wiligut lays out this “meta-history” and cosmic catastrophe physics at the verybeginning of another of his papers presented to Himmler — and marked as actuallyhaving been read by Himmler himself on 17 June 1936. In it, Wiligut states thefollowing:Each of these evolutionary epochs which have occurred up to now were, accordingto the oral secret doctrine, brought about by an enormous worldwide catastropheculminated by unifications of our earth with one of the heavenly bodiesattracted into its orbit.….In the process, the remnants of humanity which remained on the earthassimilated with those who came “from heaven” (stars) to the “earth.” Thisassimilation brought about similar intelligences and thus established a newhumanity which instituted new racial types.435[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-435]Once again, with his reference to planetary collisions, Wiligut has anticipatedthe postwar catastrophists such as Velikovsky and Alford by several decades. Andwith his reference to the interbreeding of humanity with off-world, possiblyhuman-like, intelligent life, Wiligut has anticipated the views of some postwarresearchers such as Zechariah Sitchin by several decades.Such views almost compel further speculation.Wiligut’s views on the origins of human life, obviously, would have fit Naziracial ideology quite well. But what is of interest here is that Wiligut’sactual inspiration for such views seems, at best, obscure, permitting one tospeculate. Wiligut claimed to derive them by a secret, and long-held, familytradition that was recorded on wooden runic carvings possessed and maintained byhis family for millennia. These, he maintained, were destroyed in the 1848revolution.436 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-436] But thetextual basis for such views of human origins are wellknown to anyone who hasread certain ancient Sumerian texts, and such texts were in abundance inpre-World War I Europe, the Germans having translated and published many ofthem.437 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-437] One need notappeal to a secret family tradition to have knowledge of such ideas.Similarly, Wiligut ties — almost in Alan Alfordesque fashion438[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-438] — the relationship of“cosmic collisions” of planets and meteors with the earth to the origins andsubsequent “corruptions” of humanity by interbreeding with off-world intelligentlife. In this, he is almost the first on record to work out a completemeta-history of mankind and civilization on the basis of such recurrentcollision-based catastrophist astrophysics.But as my book The Cosmic War: Interplanetary Warfare, Modern Physics, andAncient Texts argued,438 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-438]there are massive problems with such a “paleophysics” model as a tool fordecoding ancient texts. Using celestial collisions as the paradigm, the textsfade into transparency, and reveal nothing. The cosmically-scaled physics ispresent in such texts, thus hinting that the ancient legends of the wars of thegods were not metaphors, but the literal truth, as someone actually weaponized acosmically-scaled physical phenomenon, not of collisions, but of rotatingsystems.And Wiligut is one step away, in this memorandum, from making the sameconclusion.And Himmler himself has read this memorandum.As we shall shortly see, Wiligut himself even avoids the collisionalcatastrophist physics of Alan Alford and so many moderns, but moreover, he evencouches it in terms of rotating systems as his principle paleophysics paradigm.In short, of all the esotericists and occultists within the milieu of Himmler’sSS, it is Wiligut himself who represents the best possible esoteric influenceand basis for some of the SS’ subsequent projects to reconstruct the technologyof that physics. And note, in Wiligut’s hands, the “bloodline myth,” the holyGrail, has taken on a new aspect: for Wiligut rationalizes the SS quest for theHoly Grail, for the “cup of God”, in an entirely new way: the cup — the blood —may indeed contain the blood, not of Christ, but of “the ancient gods,” theoff-world human “cousins” of humanity.D. WILIGUT AND THE BLOODLINE: OTTO RAHNIn this respect, and before embarking on an examination of Wiligut’s esotericand “paleophysics” views, however, mention must be made of yet anothersignificant episode in esoteric and SS history that Wiligut brokered. This was,of course, Himmler’s personal recruitment of an esoteric scholar, historian andarcheologist into the SS, Otto Wilhelm Rahn,439[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-439] author of The CrusadeAgainst the Grail, and source of ongoing contemporary speculations of the natureand degree of SS research into the Holy Grail and the various bloodline myths ofEurope.Indeed, Wiligut maintained, as was seen, that his secret family tradition wasdestroyed in 1848 when ancient records were lost. As a part of this tradition,however, Wiligut also maintained that he himself was personally descended fromthe ancient “god” Wotan, and thus was the real “Secret King” of Germany. And itwas Wiligut with whom Rahn had been in close personal contact prior to joiningthe SS and becoming part of Himmler’s personal staff. In this capacity, Rahnwould inevitably have worked closely with Wiligut.440[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-440]Seen in this light, then, the SS obsession with the recovery of the Holy Grailis less about the recovery of the cup of the Last Supper, or even with therecovery of any putative and alleged bloodline of Christ’s descendants that somany Gnostic traditions of Europe maintained, as it is about the recovery of thelost bloodlines of the ancient gods — the very gods of the ancient Sumerianpantheon — who descended from heaven and sired offspring with humanity, forWiligut maintained adamantly that he was descended from them. We shall have moreto say about Rahn in the Epilogue.2. WILIGUT’S ALCHEMICAL VIEWS: THE “PRIMEVAL TWIST”So what exactly were Wiligut’s “esoteric physics” views? How might onecharacterize them?In a word, they were alchemical.And in being alchemical, they were also to that extent, Egyptian.Consider only the following short stanza from a poem called “Number,”submittedby Wiligut under his pen name of Jarl Widar once again, to Hagal magazine:“Spirit in Matter!” out of Aithar’s formconcealed in the dual-idea —There rests the “twist” as the primal beginning,The ring of “life’s woes.”441[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-441]spirit, the “spirit” of the form of the aether, the transmutative physicalmedium itself, in matter. This is the very quintessence of the alchemicaloperation.But note Wiligut gives a further clue as to how this might be done, for that“spirit in matter” rests in “the ‘twist’ as the primal beginning.” The primevaltwist, the primeval torsion — if one may so interpret his words — is the method,for it is the means by which the diversity of creation itself came about inWiligut’s view.3. WILIGUT’S VERSION OF THE AUGUSTINIZED TRINITY AND THE TRIPARTITE STONEAs if this were not enough, Wiligut also reproduces faithfully and almostexactly the Augustinized Trinitarian formulation we encountered back in part onewith the alchemists themselves and their formulations of the “tripartite Stone.”Indeed, the whole key to deciphering the hidden physics of runes was based upon“the flow of Matter-Energy-Spirit” which was accomplished “by the Drehauge(‘Rotating Eye’).”442 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-442] Eventhe mention of a “Rotating Eye” is suggestive of its own roots in the themes ofancient and esoteric lore, recalling the “All-Seeing Eye” so common to Egyptianmythology.443 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-443]The Triune Stone and the Augustinized formulation of the doctrine of the Trinityare exactly, and very concisely and subtly, wedded by Wiligut in the followingvery significant passage:1. Gôt is Al-unity!2. Gôt is “Spirit and Matter,” the dyad. He brings duality, and is nevertheless,unity and purity.3. Gôt is a triad: Spirit, Energy and Matter. Gôt-Spirit, Gôt-Ur, Gôt-Being, orSun-Light and Waker (Wekr), the dyad;4. Gôt is eternal — as Time, Space, Energy and Matter in his circulatingcurrent....7. Gôt — beyond the concepts of good and evil — is that which carries the sevenepochs of human history....9. …He closes the circle at N-yule, at Nothingness, out of the conscious intothe unconscious, so that this may again become conscious.444[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-444]There are several things of interest in this short passage. First, note theprogression of Wiligut’s “trinity” from unity, through a “middle step of two,”the dyad, arriving finally at the now-familiar triad of the Triune Stone of“Spirit, Energy, and Matter.”If one were to place each of these three terms in the three vertices of thenow-familiar “Augustinian Trinitarian Shield” and place “Gôt” in the centercircle, one immediately sees the connection both to the Augustinian Trinitarianformulation as well as to the alchemists’ triune stone. First, let us recall theoriginal Augustinian Trinitarian shield:029 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_029_r1.gif]Original Augustinian Trinitarian ShieldAnd now, the Triune Stone version of the alchemists:030 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_030_r1.gif]The Alchemical Triune Stone Version of the Augustinian Trinitarian ShieldAnd now, Wiligut’s version of it:031 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_031_r1.gif]Wiligut’s Version of the Triune StoneBut at this juncture, an important question occurs: What does Wiligut mean whenhe states “Gôt is eternal — as Time, Space, Energy and Matter in his circulatingcurrent?” The physics jargon employed — “circulating current” — suggests that hehas in mind precisely a physics metaphor or interpretation for the whole scheme,for a circulating current suggests precisely time as the fundamental componentof his “primal twist.” In order words, the whole pictogram might represent — hadhe known of the terminology–“primeval torsion,” time, as the underlying“hyper-space” unfolding into this world’s manifestations of energy, matter, and“spirit,” as the following diagram suggests:032 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_032_r1.gif]Implied Physics of Wiligut’s Alchemical TrinityThat this implied physics is what Wiligut ultimately had in view is furthersuggested by the last comment in the cited quotation above: “He closes thecircle…at Nothingness…” suggesting that “the cycle is concluded when it returnsto the very same substance,” nothingness, the undifferentiated physical medium,“from which it began.”445 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-445]By invoking a physics terminology with his reference to “circulating current,”Wiligut is implying that this whole alchemical-theological theme is at rootbased in physics and not metaphysics. Thus, as he avers, this “Gôt” is “beyondthe concepts of good and evil.” In a Europe already concussed with loss of faithand a confidence in Christian institutions and morality, such a statement couldonly have disastrous moral consequences, for the whole mistaken thematicidentity of this physical process with the Christian Trinity and therefore withthe whole edifice of Christian morality inevitably led to a similar mistake inethics: if they were based only in a physical process neither good nor evil,then there could be no ultimately good or evil action, only actions now more,now less, in harmony with the process itself. With Wiligut’s “triune Stone” theway was open for the genocidal alchemical transmutation of man himself.A final point should be noted about the immediately previous pictogram. Byplacing “Time” in the center, Wiligut is suggesting the very same type oftorsion physics, with time as an actual participating physical process inphysical mechanics as was suggested in the pioneering experimentation of Dr.Nikolai Kozyrev! But are there more explicit indicators that this type ofthinking was actually a basis for physics experiments inside of Germany?4. WILIGUT’S OPPOSING SPIRALS: THE “SWASTIKA TENSOR” REVISITEDIndeed, there are other statements that connect Wiligut’s views much moredirectly to the “alchemical physics” embodied in Nazi Germany’s most highlyclassified secret weapons research project, The Bell, statements that indicatethat, in part, these esoteric views might have formed part of therationalization for the project, at least, as far as the unscientific leadershipof the SS was concerned.For example, Wiligut, expounding on the nature of the “hooked cross” or swastikaas an ideogram of that physics, states the following from an article entitled“Ancient Family Crest of the House of Wiligut,” published again in the magazineHagal in 1933:TwO HOOK-CROSSES (Hakenkreuz) in both directions of rotation: to the leftturning to the right, absorbing inward; to the right turning to the left,radiating outward. Korschelt was already aware of this differentiation, which isconfirmed by the latest investigations by Heermann Kassel, M.D. In his apparatushe separates inhibiting radiation (with rightward rotation) from the growingradiation (with leftward rotation). An experimental confirmation of thisheraldic symbolism!446 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-446]In other words, for Wiligut, the imagery of the “circulating current” of thecosmos was indeed not only a very deliberately chosen physics metaphor, but alsovery deliberately coupled by him to the view of the swastika or “Hakenkreuz” -in both its orientations–as an ideogram of that physics. Moreover, as he avers,some type of medical experimentation had been underway during or prior to 1933involving precisely the separation of two rotating fields. This, as is nowwell-known and as we shall see in the next chapter, is the very basis of therationalization behind the Nazi’s Bell project!447[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-447] These were the ideograms ofthe “twist as the primal beginning,” the very ideograms of the underlyinghyper-dimensional transmutative medium itself.448[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-448] Wiligut is implying, bymeans of his reference to the swastika and the torsion-based physics itsymbolized, that the fabric of space-time has a spin orientation, just as wasimplied in the actual theorizing and experimentation of Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev.Moreover, he is also implying that as early as 1933 someone in the Third Reichis already performing medical experiments based on this conception, and sincethat person is a medical doctor, apparently the connection had already been madebetween that physics and life processes themselves.449[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-449]Wiligut makes even clearer his connection of this rotating physics view to thatof alchemy by clearly stated references to the most alchemical of all alchemicalmaxims:Primal law: “Above as below, below as above!”Therefore in the middle there is a neutral force- (i.e., generational-) field!Spirals are apparently “contrary” to each other in their rotations and despitethis, form — connected at their longitudinal ends — a “unity” from anoppositional “dyad,”duality…”Wiligut then reproduces the following diagram:033 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_033_r1.jpg]Wiligut’s Double Opposing SpiralsHe continues:From the two spirals, each triply wound and connected by the generational plane(the middle field), is developed the form of the two-ended pointed egg — theconcept of the “World Egg.”450[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-450]Once again, one is reminded of his fellow Austrian Viktor Schauberger’s similarobservations about the spiraling forms of energy which he called “implosion” and“explosion.”451 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-451]Wiligut elaborates on the above conceptions a little further on in the articlein a passage that, if one did not know it was by an Austro-German SS alchemiston the personal staff of Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler, one might be inducedto conclude it had been written in some private diary of Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev!We observe the same process, which is demonstrated here by the snail whoseshells are to be found in massive deposits in all primeval limestone formationsof our earth, and we see this same process in the Al (cosmos) in the form of“spiral galaxies”….therefore:CREATIVE PRINCIPLE:Spiritual direction in Matter through Energy!CREATIVE INFERENCE:Eternal generation, and thus eternal Life and through this an eternalcirculation, through constant “turning” of Life-forms in Matter is implied —from cause comes effect and from this the new cause is formed. From this ensuesthe law of the conservation of Energy, which again implies the “materialcirculatory transformation” — that is, the concept of “eternal life.”452[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-452]This cosmically scaled physics we have already found Wiligut identifying withthe precession of the equinoxes, the solar year, and galactic physics.453[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-453]Wiligut makes one final comment which should be cited here for its possibledirect bearing on the possible esoteric basis for the rationalization of theBell project:FURTHER INFERENCES:Both of the spirals of the “World-Egg” therefore possess two poles. In turning(rotation) these poles are connected as an axis. These are the poles —“Above-Below,” “Below-Above” — which are the World-Axis.454[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-454]So what does one make of Karl Maria Wiligut, a.k.a. Jarl Widar, a.k.a. Weisthor,“Himmler’s Rasputin”?Clearly, his basic conceptions and reconstructions of ancient “paleophysics” isalchemical in nature. Moreover, many of his specific conceptions eerily parallelnot only the thinking behind Kozyrev’s later torsion experiments, but indicatethat some similar sort of experimentation was underway in Nazi Germany as earlyas 1933 using separated and counterrotating systems of fields. Indeed, as wasseen, some sort of connection had already apparently been observed between suchsystems and the life-processes themselves. His views, therefore, since they hadthe ear of Reichsführer Himmler himself, would have sown fertile ground foranyone approaching the SS — or whom the SS approached! — with a more serious,and dangerous, project in mind.A project like the Nazi Bell.And someone like Nobel Physics Laureate Professor Dr. Walther Gerlach, theBell’s eventual project head…B. THE TAUSEND AFFAIR AND PROF. DR. WALTHER GERLACH’S ARTICLEIn my book The SS Brotherhood of the Bell: NASA’s Nazis, JFK, and MAJIC-12 Inoted that Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach, a Nobel Laureate physicist who eventuallycame to be the project head of the Nazi Bell, wrote a short article in aFrankfurt newspaper in 1924. Here, then, is what I wrote in that book about thatarticle, in a chapter entitled “Gerlach’s New Alchemy,” about this article. Icite only the relevant portions here.1. PROF. DR. WALTHER GERLACH TAKES NOTE OF AN ALCHEMICAL PAPER: EXCERPT FROM THESS BROTHERHOOD OF THE BELL“On Friday, July 8, 1924, Nobel Laureate physicist Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach,published an interesting article in the evening edition of the FrankfurterZeitung newspaper entitled ‘The Transmutation of Mercury into Gold’ (see picturepage 285). The article, though brief, opens a Pandora’s box of possibilities andspeculations dark with abysmal promise. The editorial introduction beginsinnocently enough:To yesterday’s telegraphically transmitted note on “Modern Alchemy,” we presentthe following report as a welcome supplement and commentary.And with that short notice, Gerlach’s main text follows in all its significantconcision:In no. 29 of the weekly magazine “Physical Science,” Prof. A. Miethe from theTechnical Higher School in Charlottenburg together with Dr. Staumreich apprisesus (of the fact) that it might be possible to induce the disintegration ofmercury with relatively simple physical methods and to clearly identify gold asone of the chemical and physical products of the disintegration. Until now wehave known of two types of atomic bonding: spontaneous decay that occurs throughno sort of external influence, and that through such external radioactivedisintegration process such as was first carried out by the English physicistRutherford, and as was shortly thereafter repeated in the Vienna RadiumInstitute by disintegrating lighter atoms (for example, lithium, boron, silicon,aluminum and so on) through bombardment with “rays.” The general possibility ofan “alchemy” is no longer in need of proof, since atomic research hasdemonstrated that all atoms are constructed from very simple building blocks,from hydrogen and helium, the lightest things…; various chemical elements mayhereafter be distinguished by the number of components and perhaps through thetypes of atoms they (most readily) bind to.034 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_034_r1.gif]Gerlach’s 1924 Frankfurter Zeitung Newspaper Article on the Transmutation ofMercury into GoldThe point of origin of Miethe’s (investigation) was the observation that mercurylamps … by means of very powerful and fast bombardment formed a darkincrustation on their interior winding. The research obtained greater amounts ofsuch incrustation in the mercury lamps — it was made certain that such mercurylamps were free of any gold material, in the course of 70–200 hours with 70volts potential and loaded with 400–2000 watts — yielding a measurable quantityof gold!....The amounts are small, but they are always between 1/10 and 1/100milligrams, but tangibly weighable and analyzable. …A larger scientificexploration is to be hoped for, because there is every indication these authorshave made a singular and thoroughgoing breakthrough, especially when oneconsiders the astonishingly low stability of mercury when it is stressed.455[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-455]On first reading, the article appears like so many other popular sciencearticles of that era when nuclear physics was on the verge of the discovery offission (by Otto Hahn fourteen years later in 1938): full of promise, yetnaively unaware of the complexities of quantum mechanics that lurked just aroundthe corner. A modern-day physicist would most likely dismiss it as the type of‘wishful thinking’ that so often accompanies scientific discovery, before the‘reality’ of subsequent observation sets in.“But there are problems with that viewpoint too, not the least of which is thatthe article is by Gerlach, and that it does occur before the discovery ofnuclear fission. Simply put, the transmutation being observed by professorsMiethe and Straumreich [sic] appears to be induced precisely by ‘electrolytical’methods, since the ‘bombardment’ being referred to is expressed in conventionalterms of ‘volts’ and ‘watts.’ Yet, the context also indicates that radioactivebombardment — most likely by electrically generated X-rays — is also in mind.“And there are other peculiarities about the article not to be missed, and thatis the name of the professor supposedly who made the discovery: A. Miethe.Readers familiar with the Nazi Legend of the UFO will recognize the name ofMiethe as being one of those allegedly involved with Schriever, Habermol, Epp,Schauberger, and Bellonzo in flying saucer research for the Nazis. Could this bethe same Miethe, or even a relation?“…Whatever the answer to these questions may turn out to be, one thing is clearfrom Gerlach’s article, and that is that he is not thinking in terms of thestandard models of transmutation via neutron bombardment that would obtain afterthe discovery of nuclear fission simply because those models do not yet exist,yet, he is thinking in terms of some form of transmutation via radioactive andelectromagnetic bombardment, or rather, stress. Indeed, for Gerlach, whose 1921experiment in magnetic resonance and electron spin won him the Nobel prize inphysics, these results must have set his own mind buzzing with the possibilitiesof what spin and resonance, under extreme conditions, might be able to achieve,given enough funding, interest, and research. This, I believe, is what must haveactually been in his mind.“These insights make his final two comments darkly revealing. ‘A largerscientific exploration is to be hoped for,’ Gerlach urges, ‘because there isevery indication these authors have made a singular and thoroughgoingbreakthrough, especially when one considers the astonishingly low stability ofmercury when it is stressed.’ It is the familiar cry of a scientist making aplea for research funding. And given his notoriety and that of the newspaper inwhich he presents his plea, there can be only one intended target of hisremarks: the German government and its many corporate financial backers.“But notice the final remark concerning ‘the astonishingly low stability ofmercury when it is stressed.’ Gerlach here enunciates in a few words the line ofinvestigation he wishes such research to take: subject a high-density, viscous,low-stability metal such as mercury to stress. And given the context, we knowwhat kind of stress he intends to subject it to: radioactive and electrical.Gerlach has deduced the obvious: if such simple means can cause minute amountsof mercury to transmute into gold, then this must mean that these conditionsinduce a kind of instability in mercury. And with that, a whole new world ofpossibilities opened up before him, a world he himself calls ‘alchemical.’”456[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-456] And there I let matters lie, at least, insofar as alchemy itself was concerned.But what was, in fact, the wider context of Gerlach’s remarks? What was thatpaper by professors Miethe and Staumreich [sic] to which Gerlach had referred?This is where it gets…interesting…2. ALCHEMICAL PAPERS BY ONE JAPANESE AND TWO GERMAN PHYSICISTSThe story begins when a Japanese physicist named Nagaoka and his associatesperformed an experiment in March, 1924, the same year as the appearance ofGerlach’s article some four months later. Studying various spectral lines ofisotopes of mercury and bismuth, and particularly the spectral lines of gold,Nagaoka and his associates at the University of TokyoDischarged about 15 x 104 volts/cm for 4 hours between tungsten and mercury(terminals) under a dielectric layer of paraffin oil. They used the Purple ofCassius test to detect (gold) in the viscous residue… The black mass waspurified in vacuo, then by combustion with oxygen and extraction with(hydrochloric acid) to yield (gold), either in aqua regia solution or asruby-red spots in the glassware. Microscopic films of (gold) were found onoccasion.457 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-457]Shades of David Hudson!Nagaoka also observed that “In order to be sure of transmutation, repeatedpurification of (mercury) by distilling in vacuum at temperatures below 200 isessential.”458 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-458] Bear thatvery low temperature in mind, for it will become a crucial part of the story inthe next chapter.But what Nagaoka then proposed was breathtaking, for at that time, no high-spinstate nucleus model had then been observed or proposed — at least and as far asis known from the extant literature, not publicly:If the above assumption as to the (mercury) nucleus is valid, we can perhapsrealize the dream of alchemists by striking out a hydrogen-proton from thenucleus by (alpha-)rays or by some other powerful methods of disruption (toproduce (gold) from (mercury)).459[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-459]In short, Nagaoka was suggesting that a proton could be ‘slightly detached’ fromthe nucleus” of mercury and removed.460[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-460] Professor Nagaoka’s methodof removal is obvious from the quotation above: subject the nucleus tobombardment and see if a proton is kicked loose. Such ideas, circulating at thetime, would have surely caught Gerlach’s attention, and indeed one of Nagaoka’sarticles is written in May of 1924, precisely in the German scientific journalNaturwissenschaften. This might have suggested to Gerlach other methods of suchtransmutation, such as high spin, his specialty.But at approximately the same time at the Photochemical Department of Belin’sTechnical High School, Professor Adolf Miethe “found that mercury vapor lampsused as a source for ultra-violet rays ceased to work after a time because of asooty deposit which formed in the quartz tubes.”461[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-461] Testing these deposits hediscovered that they contained gold. On May 8, 1924, he and his associate Dr.Hans Stammreich were issued a German patent, number 233,715, entitled“Improvements in or Relating to the Extraction of Precious Metals.”462[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-462] The amount of golddepended, in part, on the difference in electrical potential, the quantity ofcurrent, and the pressure of the mercury vapor.463[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-463]Such considerations as these would also, let it be noted, have provided afurther stimulus to the possible Nazi development of laser isotope separation,as seen in the previous chapter, for it takes little imagination to see that amore efficient means of separating and even transmuting elements or theirisotopes would be precisely via bombardment by coherent electromagneticradiation — such as laser light — that was precisely tuned to the resonantfrequencies of the elements or isotopes to be separated.But with Meithe and Stammreich’s patent, the alchemical genie was let out of thebottle, and scientists around the world began arguing for, and against, thepossibility and the results of their experiments. And as has been seen, Gerlachhimself had already weighed in, with his article in the Frankfurter Zeitung, infavor of the possibility. For example,O. Honigschmid and E. Zintl determined the atomic weight of Miethe’s mercuric(gold), using potentiometric titration or auric salt with TiCl2. It was found tobe 197.26, which is heavier than ordinary (gold) (197.2). They emphasized theneed for a mass spectrographic analysis.464[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-464]Other scientists weighed in against the whole scenario, arguing principally thatthe methods being proposed for the observed transmutations were simplyinadequate to account for the phenomenon.Then in December of 1924 the magazine Scientific American “announced that itwould arrange for a comprehensive and exact test of the Miethe experiment.”465[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-465] Tests were performed and areplica of Miethe’s equipment actually procured from Germany, but in no casecould any traces of gold be discovered. Some suggested therefore that Miethe hadonly detected it because the original starting mercury contained gold.466[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-466] But perhaps anothermechanism was in play, one that we know from Kozyrev’s experiments and from theobservations of the alchemists themselves: timing of an operation was crucial toits success.The Germans remained undaunted. In 1926, the giant German electrical firm ofSiemens got into the act, announcing in April 1926 that “a 10,000 fold increasein yield had been obtained in the production of mercuric-gold process.” TheSiemens firm had bombarded mercury with “electrons in extremely high vacuum” andobtained a hundred milligrams “from 1 (kilogram) of (mercury).”467[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-467] Siemens und Halske AktionsGesellschaft subsequently obtained a German patent, number 243,760, for theprocess. 468 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-468]The entire affair raged on, with the original performers of the variousexperiments, Professors Nagaoka, Miethe, and Stammreich, quietly handling thecriticism. But “the entire issue was never resolved.”469[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-469]What emerges from the whole affair are two things. One has already been seen,namely, that someone in Germany may have connected the mechanisms at work eitherto spin resonance phenomena, on the one hand, or to the possibility of coherentoptical separation via a “cascade” or lasing principle on the other. After all,what had started the whole affair was pulsing mercury vapors electrically. Whynot pulse them with precisely tuned resonant frequencies of coherent laserlight? Had the Germans asked that question — and as was seen from the previouschapter a circumstantial case can be made that they did — then it would haveinevitably led them, as Richard Hoagland proposed and I argued in the previouschapter, to cohered light — lasers — as the only truly mechanism to accomplishit.But the other thing that emerges from this affair is…3… THE FRANZ TAUSEND AFFAIRWith Franz Tausend, alchemy itself enters the picture quite openly, not hidingbehind scientific papers in obscure journals, for Tausend was self-admittedly apracticing alchemist. And, if one is to believe his claims, he began producinggold from mercury in the 1920s. 470[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-470]But this is not his significance. His significance lies rather in the fact thatby 1925 Tausend was a close associate of none other than General ErichLudendorff, the famous general who led Imperial Germany’s last offensive in thespring and summer of 1918 against the Western Allies, an offensive that cameuncomfortably close to splitting the British and French armies and driving theformer into the sea.And Erich Ludendorff was, by 1925, closely associated with none other than AdolfHitler and a strong supporter of the Nazi party. Tausend managed to obtainapproximately 100,000 gold Reichsmarks from Ludendorff for his experiments, andthe financial backing of other German industrialists such as AlfredMannesmann.471 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-471] This led tothe formation of “alchemical corporations” with Tausend naturally at the center.Its other prominent backers included, of course, Himmler, and later high-rankingSS general Oswald Pohl.There even exists, as the following photograph attests, a postwar letter fromPohl attesting the existence of these “alchemical companies” for Himmler:035 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_035_r1.gif]Oswald Pohl’s Postwar Letter Concerning the German and Nazi “AlchemicalCorporations”The Tausend affair erupted into a something of a national and internationalscandal for the Nazis and their associates, however, for much of the money wentto supporting the scheme’s luxurious tastes, and the process cost more than thevalue of what it produced, eventually leading Tausend to a popularly publicizedtrial for fraud in Germany, a trial that received some international attention,even making, in the first instance, the front page of The New York Times.472[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-472]C. CONCLUSIONSWhatever one makes of the Tausend Affair, one thing is clear if one places itwithin the wider context of the peer-reviewed “alchemical” science of the timesin general, and of the alchemical philosophy of Wiligut in particular, and thatis that there is ample enough conceptual soil for the SS to have pursued,quietly and off the books, an “alchemical” physics. And with the appearancescarcely a decade later of Otto Hahn’s actual discovery of nuclear fission byneutron bombardment, at least one clear method was available, one that theGerman scientists — like scientists elsewhere — readily appreciated could leadto a horrible new weapon of mass destruction, the atom bomb.And there was enough conceptual ferment both within the scientific culture ofquantum mechanics — Germany’s “home-grown” and thus “Aryan” science — that wouldhave also suggested to them a radical and very advanced form of isotopeseparation: laser isotope separation depending on the principle of the photoncascade. As was seen in the previous chapter, there is a circumstantial casethat can be made that this was precisely what they did, fully four decades inadvance of its public disclosure in the scientific literature. Nor in the finalanalysis need one balk at the possibility of such advanced rationalizations oftechnology in that time frame, for a similar process was also very much inevidence with their other secret weapons projects in general, and with the Bellin particular.Finally, with Karl Maria Wiligut, for a brief period prior to the warReichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler’s close personal advisor in occult matters, onehas an alchemical philosopher of the physical medium itself, a medium moreoverthat he viewed as having spin orientation characteristics, a concept that couldnot have been lost on someone like Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach, project head ofthe Nazi Bell."},{"pageContent":"12THE NAZI SERUM “IRR XERUM 525,” THE NAZI BELL, AND THE RECIPE036 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_036_r1.jpg]“…how did it happen that scientists from the 1940s understood exactly where theywere heading?

But one component of the Bell was, andremains, a mystery: its “fuel,” the enigmatic “IRR Xerum 525,” the Nazi Serum.In order to see how, and what this mysterious compound might have been, a reviewof the Bell project is in order. In doing so, many possible “alchemical”connections will become evident.A. THE BLACK PROJECTS REICH WITHIN THE REICH: THE KAMMLERSTAB THINK TANKThe story of the coordinating body for Nazi secret weapons, the SSSonderkommando Kammler (Special Command Kammler), also known as the Kammlerstab(Kammler Staff), has been told in a variety of books by various competentresearchers, but the story first broke to a general public when one of itscivilian members, Dr. Wilhelm Voss, shared his story with British journalist TomAgoston. Voss swore Agoston to secrecy until his death, at which point Agostontold his story in a short book that disclosed the existence of what, for allintents and purposes, was the world’s first “secret weapons think tank,” adeeply classified covert SS think tank whose mission brief far exceeded, orrather dwarfed, that of the American “Manhattan District” atom bomb project.Headed by SS Obergruppenführer — equivalent to a four-star general — Dr. Ing.Hans Kammler, this group recruited scientists from all over Germany andthroughout Europe, and essentially told them to map out the technology trees tosecond-, third-, and fourth-generation weapons technologies and platforms.General Kammler himself was not only the head of this group, but significantly,also the very architect who had designed the notorious Auschwitz concentrationcamps, and who also was head of the entire SS Buildings and Works Department.Thus, Kammler is probably connected to the vast “Buna” factory of I.G. Farben atAuschwitz — a plant that we have previously argued was actually a large uraniumseparation and enrichment facility that employed a variety of exotic separationtechnologies, including perhaps a rudimentary laser isotope separation technique— and as head of the Buildings and Works Department of the SS, he could tap intoa potential slave labor pool of over ten million people.1. AGOSTON AND DR. WILHELM VOSSIt is this probable connection of Kammler to the Auschwitz “Buna” factory thatis significant, for as Dr. Wilhelm Voss told Agoston, the Kammler Group’spurposewas to pave the way for building nuclear-powered aircraft, working on theapplication of nuclear energy for propelling missiles and aircraft; laser beams,then still referred to as “death rays”; a variety of homing rockets and to seekother potential areas for high-technology breakthrough. In modern jargon, theoperation would probably be referred to as an “SS research think tank.” Somework on second-generation secret weapons, including the application of nuclearpropulsion for aircraft and missiles, was already well advanced.480[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-480]The significance of the remark concerning lasers has already been explored inchapter ten in connection with the possible development of a rudimentary tunablelaser isotope separation process by the Nazis and the SS.Here a further clue is provided, for such an advanced technology of isotopeseparation would be valuable not only in the separation and enrichment of neededisotopes for an atom bomb — uranium-235 and plutonium-239481[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-481] — but also in theseparation of elements and isotopes needed as the fuel for any nuclearpropulsion as well.However, there is one more significant point to bear in mind. The term “nuclearpropulsion” as used here is rather vague and all-encompassing; it could mean,and it will be argued subsequently that it does mean, any form of fieldpropulsion or anti-gravity technology that relies on some form of radioactiveisotopes in the creation of those field effects.In this context Igor Witkowski mentions a significant fact, and that is, bywar’s end, General Kammler had also been bestowed the title ofReichsbevollmächtigter für den Aufbau des Forschungszentrums in Pilsen zur Frageatomaren Technologien für den Antrieb von Lenkwaffen und Flugzeugen, or “ReichPlenipotentiary for the Construction of Research Centers in Pilsen concerningAtomic Technologies for Propulsion of Guided Weapons and Aircraft.”482[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-482] Such a title, and theconsiderable authority that went with it, bestowed by Hitler himself, on apractical engineering projects manager such as Kammler, is a strong indicatorthat Nazi Germany had progressed things to the point of practical operationaldeployment of at least some of these technologies, and that other more advancedones were showing signs of imminent success. Success beyond anyone’s wildestdreams.Something like the Bell.2. THE REICHPROTEKTORAT OF BOHEMIA AND MORAVIADr. Voss was assigned to the engineering division of the famous Skoda Munitionsworks in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, after the German annexation of that country inMarch 1939. It was in this department that Kammler set up and headquartered hissecret weapons think tank. When Germany made all of Bohemian and MoravianCzechoslovakia a “Reichprotektorat,” all of Bohemia — including the Skoda Worksand Kammler’s think tank — fell under the jurisdiction of the SS under thecommand of none other than Reinhard Heydrich, Himmler’s virtual “second incommand” of the entire SS.This fact, plus the presence of Kammler’s think tank at Pilsen, effectively madethe Reichprotektorat — the entire province — Nazi Germany’s version of theNevada Test Ranges, a vast secret projects preserve under SS jurisdiction. Andwithin this “secure zone,” with its Gestapo agents crawling the countrysideferreting out sedition, Kammler’s think tank was surrounded with a triple beltof security of political, economic, and technological counterintelligencepersonally headed by none other than close Martin Bormann associate, the head ofthe actual Gestapo, Heinrich “Gestapo” Müller!483[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-483]037 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_037_r1.jpg]Dr. Wilhelm Voss and Nazi bigwigs at the Skoda Works in Pilsen. Dr. Voss is thecivilian in the hat on the right side of the front row3. THE FORSCHUNGEN, ENTWICKLUNGEN, UND PATENTEAnother group connected to Kammler’s “think tank” and tied directly to the Bellproject was the F.E.P., or Forschungen, Entwicklungen, und Patente (Researches,Developments, and Patents) group of the SS, headed by an obscure but apparentlyextremely important SS Obergruppenführer named Emil Mazuw.484[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-484] The mission brief of thisgroup was to scour German and other European scientific journals, personnel, andpatents for anything that could be of value for a potential technologicalbreakthrough and military application.485[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-485] Another mission brief ofthis group concerned the development precisely of theories and technologies thatcould lead to German energy independence.Consequently, with the F.E.P. one has suggestive clues as to some of thepurposes of Nazi research with the Bell project, namely, that in addition to itspossible purpose in the development of field propulsion, yet another purpose mayhave been to access new sources of energy that would free Germany fromdependence on “fossil” fuels and other non-renewable energy sources, which werescarce in Europe.In any case, one of the things that surely would have come to the attention ofthis group were precisely the patents of Miethe, Stammreich, and the Siemenscorporation, and the article of Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach concerning mercury togold transmutations and the scientific possibility of an “alchemy.” This,coupled with the probable SS knowledge of esoteric Sanskrit and other textsconcerning mercury propulsion, and the general “alchemical” climate within theSS that was close to Himmler — namely Wiligut et al. — would have providedfertile group culture for the SS to commit to the study and research of theactual scientific possibilities that such texts could have held. If there was agroup within the SS that would have made such connections, and been capable offulfilling the Ahnenerbe’s brief of the military applications of such texts andtraditions, the F.E.P. was it.4. THE SS ENTWICKLUNGSTELLE IVYet another shadowy group connected to all this highly classified SS secretblack projects relating to the Bell was the SS Entwicklungstelle IV, or“Development Area 4.” While the term “area” may refer to a group investigating acertain “area” of research, there is another possibility, and that is that“area” might indeed refer to an actual geographical location of underground andsecret installations conducting the research. Many such SS research groups wereindeed designated by the actual area where the research was conducted.If this “SS Development Area IV” sounds vaguely familiar, that’s because it is.Well-known UFOlogist Bob Lazar claimed to have worked at a secret area withinArea 51 in Nevada called “S-4”, hidden underground in a mountain near Papoosedry lake, south of Groom Lake, or Area 51 itself. While this author has manydifficulties with aspects of Mr. Lazar’s story and the claims of his associateJohn Lear, two aspects of the story stand out as possibly significant in thecontext of Nazi research into advanced field propulsion concepts.The first is, of course, the designation “S-4,” a dim resonance of “SSDevelopment Area IV.” The second is that both groups appear to have been workingon more or less the same thing: advanced field propulsion or “UFO” technology.But the third is perhaps the most unusual and interesting of them all.Lazar claimed that the “captured alien flying saucers” he was allowed to work onat “Area S-4” utilized element 115 as the fuel for the matter-antimatterreactions that powered the craft. At the time that Lazar first made theseclaims, element 115, now known as unumpentium, had not yet been synthesized.When it was, however, it was done at the high energy physics center inDarmstadt, Germany.These claims constitute, for this author, some of those problematical areas ofLazar’s story, for the underlying physics assumptions implied by these claims isthat the matter-antimatter relationship in the universe is more or less one ofequilibrium, i.e., that the same amounts of both exist. This author does notsubscribe to this view. But the second physics problem posed by this assertionis that Lazar claimed he and Lear actually obtained an amount of it. However,the element’s half-life is far too short for a substantial amount to beaccumulated, much less obtained and held for a period any longer than a fewfractions of a second.However, might the real intention of the episode have been ultimately not todisclose “crashed and recovered UFOs” and a secret black project designed toreverse-engineer the technology, but something else? Might the whole episodehave been contrived by someone — not necessarily Lazar — to point a very clear,though very subtle, finger toward Germany as the source of some of these“extra-terrestrial” technologies, with its references to a secret “Area S-4”dimly evocative of “SS Development Area IV” and to “element 115,” subsequentlyactually synthesized in Germany? Certainly neither Lazar nor his associate JohnLear have ever — to this author’s knowledge — made such claims. But it isinteresting that Lazar subsequently indicated, after going public with hisstory, that he had been contacted by the group in Germany that had synthesizedunumpentium to come to Germany and assist in their research, for they had heardof his story and its mention of element 115! Thus, yet another subtle clue mayhave been released, pointing yet another finger to that country as a “player” inthe development of such technologies.B. THE NAZI BELL, ITS OPERATION, EFFECTS, AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALIZATIONS: AREVIEWBefore proceeding to outline a speculative case of what the mysterious IRR Xerum525 might have been composed of, and what its use in the Bell was designed todo, a brief review of the Bell itself — its construction, operation, effects,and scientific rationalizations for them — is in order. Briefly stated, itsconstruction, operation, and effects, are these:1. While the size of the Bell’s dimensions vary according to which sources oneconsults, the standard size may safely be said to be from 12–15 feet tall, and9–12 feet wide;486 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-486]2. It was cylindrical and bell-shaped in appearance, hence its codename amongthe Germans, die Glocke, the Bell;487[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-487]3. Its outer shell was composed of some type of ceramic or metallic material;488[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-488]4. It was cryogenically cooled by liquid nitrogen or oxygen;489[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-489]5. Around its outside there were several ports for high-voltage electricalcabling, a fact that indicates that the Bell could be transported to varioussites for testing and “plugged in.” Additionally, the Bell made abuzzing-hissing sound when in operation, a fact that led to its nickname amongthe Germans, die Bienenstock, the Beehive;490[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-490]6. Inside the device were two counter-rotating drums capable of being spun atextremely high velocities;491[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-491]a. Witkowski has argued that these drums were nested one inside the other, as ina typical plasma focus device;492[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-492]b. I have previously argued that another possible arrangement was one on top ofthe other;493 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-493]7. The top of the device had some sort of hook-like attachment, indicating thatit could perhaps be suspended from a balance scale or similar device;494[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-494]8. In the central core of the Bell was a stationary shaft, into which a “thermosbottle” containing the Serum 525 was placed;495[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-495]9. Mercury and possibly the Serum 525 itself were placed on the surfaces of therotating cylinders;496 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-496]10. The Bell gave off extremely toxic, and in some cases lethal, field effectsto a distance of some 150-200 meters from the device when in operation.497[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-497] Accordingly, a variety oforganic materials and life forms were tested in its presence. Among its manyeffects, the following two are of noteworthy significance:a. In the case of plants, exposure to its field resulted in the cellularbreakdown of plants within hours to weeks, with the plants decaying suddenly andfinally to a state of a brown-grayish goo;498[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-498]b. In the case of humans, its first tests resulted in the deaths of five of theseven scientists involved. While subsequent tests appear to have mitigated theseeffects, people exposed to its field reported the sensation of “pins andneedles” on their skin, of sleeplessness, and a persisting metallic taste in themouth;499 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-499]c. the Bell’s above-ground test-rig, the so-called Henge structure atLudwigsdorff, shows signs of exposure to heavy ionized and neutron radiation.Additionally, the structure’s steel reinforcement bolts running around the topof the structure appear to have been sheared or broken off by some abrupt andpowerful force;500 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-500]d. the Bell also exploded light bulbs and created damage in electrical equipmentin the surrounding environs during its tests above ground;501[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-501]11. In the case of outdoor tests conducted at night, some concentration campworkers associated with the project report seeing “barrel-like” devicesascending above the tree-lines with a pale blue glow;502[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-502]12. The Bell was tested under the most extreme security around the environs ofLudwigsdorff and Castle Fürstenstein in the mountains of Lower Silesia;503[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-503]13. Approximately sixty of the scientists and technicians connected with theproject were murdered by the SS prior to the end of the war, and the device, andall its project documentation, along with General Kammler and a massivesix-engine Junkers 390 heavy lift ultra-long-range aircraft went missing at theend of the war;504 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-504]14. Its scientific head, Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach, was one of the interredscientists at Farm Hall, who was heard talking mysteriously of magnetic fieldsseparation, vortex compression, the gravitation of the earth’s magnetic field,and so on. Additionally, Dr. Gerlach was the only one of the Farm Hallscientists subsequently taken to the United States for further interrogation.Upon his return to Germany, he never wrote again of gravitation or spinresonance and other subjects that had been his specialty before the war.505[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-505]15. One of the Bell’s project scientists, and the designer of its power plant,the electrical engineer Dr. Kurt Debus, subsequently ended up as a senior flightdirector during the NASA Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space projects at CapeCanaveral;506 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-506]16. A mathematician from the University of Königsberg, Dr. Elizabeth Adler, wasbrought in as a consultant during the project, for reasons never disclosed inthe currently extant evidence concerning the project;507[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-507]17. The Bell’s code names, Das Laternenträgerprojekt, The Lantern-bearerProject, and Projekt Kronos, Project Time, or alternatively, Project Saturn, areevocative of an esoteric and occult influence possibly at work in the backgroundof the project, since “lantern-bearer” or “light-bearer” is a loose conceptualrelationship to Lucifer, the light-bearer, and “Kronos” is the Greek word bothfor time and for the planet Saturn. Thus, the code name Projekt Kronos couldsuggest a project having to do both with the manipulation of time, and with somefield propulsion experiment designed to give lead to access to distant planets,symbolized by Saturn.508 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-508]Finally, there is also a reference to the Bell project also being code-named Toror “Gate” at some point in the literature.509[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-509]The scientific rationalizations of some of these points will now be brieflyexplored, while other points relating to its project environs and history willbe left for later.1. KALUZA-KLEIN, TORSION, AND THE LAYOUT OF THE COUNTER-ROTATING DRUMSIn my book Secrets of the Unified Field, I explored at some length the cogentarguments of Bell researcher Igor Witkowski that the counter-rotating drumswithin the device had been laid out in the form of a typical plasma focus, oneinside the other. Indeed, Witkowski’s arguments are compelling, and rationalizethe device quite well.510 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-510]As outlined in Secrets of the Unified Field, however, a case can be argued thatthe Nazis may have rationalized the device along the lines of the incorporationof some form of torsion tensor in the unified field theories that began to bepublished in the Weimar Republic between the wars and before the Nazi assumptionof power. There I argued that the presence of a mathematician from theUniversity of Königsberg — the same university that saw the development of thefirst such hyper-dimensional unified field theory, that of mathematician Dr.Theodor Kaluza — within the Bell project pointed to a modified form of Kaluza’stheory, that included torsion, as the basis of the project. Additionally, thattheory’s “geometry” was cylindrical.511[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-511]Since one of the effects of torsion is similar to wringing an empty soda canlike a dishrag, producing spiraling folds and pleats in the fabric of spacetimesimilar to the spiraling folds and pleats in the can that result from its“wringing,” I speculated that in order to maximize this torsion effect withinthe Bell, that the counter-rotating drums were analogous to this image: thedrums, in other words, could equally be rationalized to have been placed one ontop of the other, in order to maximize the torsion effect produced by thedevice.A. WILIGUTHowever, as has now been seen in our previous examination of the esotericinfluences at work within the Nazi Party, the SS, and Germany itself between thewars, there is yet another possible conceptual influence hovering in thebackground: the alchemical views of Karl Maria Wiligut, and his very influentialposition in the immediate circle of advisors around Reichsföhrer SS HeinrichHimmler. As noted, Wiligut himself promulgated views that the physical medium,in his understanding of esotericism, was the result of “the primal twist,” animage that immediately conjures the notion of torsion. Moreover, Wiligut alsoviewed the image of the Nazi Party, the swastika itself, as an ideogram of thatphysics. Thus, in addition to the scientific culture of Germany itself, there iswithin the SS an additional impetus to the consideration of such views, namely,the alchemical influence of Wiligut.B. RUDOLF HESS AND NAZI HERMETICISM: THE EGYPTIAN, ALCHEMICAL AND UNIFIED FIELDTHEORY CONNECTIONSThe alchemical views of Wiligut gain an additional significance in this respectwhen little-known connections between alchemy and the various unified fieldtheories then in vogue in Germany are considered. The British researcherGeoffrey Brooks mentions a little-known, seldom-discussed fact about the Britishinterrogations of Rudolf Hess in which Hess makes some disturbing, or —depending on one’s lights — insane statements:Rudolf Hess, interrogated in the Tower of London under the effect of a truthserum, stated that National Socialists valued the occult sciences highly andmight even be, through Hitler, the puppets of a clandestine Directorate in theOrient.512 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-512]Such an insane assertion would surely be dismissed, had it come from anyone elseother than Hess, at the time the actual Nazi Party head as its Reichsleiter, ageneral in the SS as well, and himself highly interested in occult and esotericmatters, having imbibed them from his youth growing up in… Alexandria, Egypt.And the assertion, disturbing as it is, permits perhaps other high speculations.Might Allied knowledge of the existence of such a relationship, or the awarenessthat the Nazis themselves, at the highest levels, believed that such arelationship existed, have been a factor in the Allied declaration that nothingbut unconditional surrender of Germany would do, a declaration that virtuallyassured that the war would be a fight to the literal death of one or the otherof the sides, and of their leaders? Whatever the answer to that purelyspeculative question may be, it is Hess’ and the SS’ interests in the occult,and his connection to Egypt, that is of crucial importance here.As Brooks observes, even thoughThe underlying philosophy of Nazi science is undocumented, it is likely to havebeen the Hermetic tradition. Hitler was a disciple of the Buddhistic thinkerSchopenhauer, and his success stemmed from a profound knowledge of magicalcauses occasioned by reading Schopenhauer’s treatment of Hermeticism. By this ismeant the ancient Trismegistic literature of the Hermetic tradition of whichuncontested Egyptian treatises survive and thus for the second time…we (find)ourselves confronted by the spectre of Ancient Egypt in connection with NationalSocialism.513 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-513]But what has this alchemical connection — for Hermeticism is but another namefor alchemy — to do with physics in general and the various unified fieldtheories of the 1920s and 1930s that were published in Germany?Brooks states the connection as ably as any:Hermetic science states that each element in matter has as its crystal a uniquegeometric form…. All matter, mineral or organic, is merely a molecular structureheld together by a keynote, from which one can infer that everything in thematerial universe is the result of vibration, a fortuitous concourse of atoms….This was the secret behind the philosophy of Schopenhauer, the guru of Hitler,that the material world is only an illusion and no physical object has anypermanent reality. The only reality is the vibration.514[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-514]On this view, the lattice structure of the elements — its “pure crystallineform” — is thus a representation of those vibrations. As a consequence of thisview, the physical forces can in turn be understood to be defects or distortionsin that structure. Bear these views in mind, for we shall encounter them againin the next chapter.Thus arose the idea of “Aryan Physics,” a term coined by two Nobel LaureateGerman physicists, both members and ardent supporters of the Nazi party: Dr.Philipp Lenard and Dr. Johannes Stark.515[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-515] The direct targets of thisartificial paradigm were, of course, the Jewish physics of Einstein representedby his relativity theories. But another lesser known target were the quantummechanical theories of Heisenberg with its apparent lack of structure, and itsuncertainty principle.516 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-516]In short, Stark and Lenard were, like Dr. Kozyrev much later in Russia, veryuncomfortable with the counterintuitive nature of relativistic and quantummechanical physics. While the vast errors and contradictions of their “Aryanphysics” are well-known and almost tiresomely rehearsed as examples of thepersistent breakdown of physics inside of Nazi Germany, the truth in fact maynot be so simple, for if projects such as the Bell existed in Nazi Germany, andif they achieved the sensational results that are alleged for them — and theymost assuredly did — then what “Aryan physics” really represents is an attempt,howsoever clumsy and contradictory, to lay out the outlines and philosophy for awholly different paradigm of physics.In this light, Brooks makes a rather interesting series of observations:Much earlier….Aryan Physics suspected that when Einstein was working on theunified field theory, he realized that relativity could not be accommodated init, but by then it was impossible for him to admit his earlier error. Whiledismissing relativity altogether, Aryan Physics also refuted quantum physics onthe grounds that all unified field theories continued to view space-time inEinstein’s terms. Since Hermetic science accepts other dimensions beyond our owndimensions beyond our own continuum, presumably this, together with theassertion that the sub-atomic world has no independent structure, was what AryanPhysics considered was lacking in quantum theory.517[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-517]In short, Aryan physics is a clumsy attempt to develop the same thing thatKozyrev developed, namely, a science of time and “causal mechanics” based on thespiraling motions and distortions in space-time represented by torsion andcrystal defects, for note what “Aryan Physics” is actually saying:1. The geometry of general relativity is inadequate to the unification ofgravity and electromagnetism;2. when considering certain effects, it would appear there is a substructure toquantum mechanics not yet known, and deserving of investigation;3. higher-dimensional theories are acceptable since the indeterminancy ofquantum mechanics could only be overcome by means of such higher-dimensionaltheories.As I have already argued in my book Secrets of the Unified Field, the work ofGabriel Kron, crucial to any practical applications of unified field theories,no doubt came to the attention of the Nazis and impelled them to the developmentof both the physics and technologies, not of Einstein’s unified field theory,but of Theodore Kaluza’s unified field theory. Moreover, this theory, with itsfour dimensions of space and one of time, was a fully fledged hyper-dimensionaltheory untainted by having been originated from a Jewish physicist.Additionally, Kaluza remained in Germany at various teaching posts throughoutthe Nazi era.If this was indeed what was actually going on behind the scenes in Nazi Germany,as it has every appearance by now of being, then the German physicists could nothave avoided coming to the same conclusion that Kozyrev came to, and with thesame result of having their work highly classified as was Kozyrev’s much later:time was not a scalar, but an active force.That force was torsion.And it was evident in the SS via alchemical influences of Wiligut, thescientific milieu of “Aryan Physics,” the various unified field theory papers ofthe 1920s and 1930s.And it could be engineered.2. TWO TYPES OF ELECTRICAL POTENTIALS AND ULTRA-HIGH SPEED MECHANICAL ROTATIONYet another area of speculative difference between Witkowski’s interpretation ofthe Bell and my own is that Witkowski maintains that the Bell’s electricaloperation was continuous and relied upon normal alternating current. My ownspeculations, developed in Secrets of the Unified Field, were that the Bell’snickname, “the Beehive,” and its characteristic hissing buzzing sound wasperhaps indicative of the rapid opening and closing of a very high voltagedirect current switch, delivering several thousands of high-voltage DC pulses inthe device. Furthermore, the close proximity of a power plant to Bell’s testinstallations may have been further testimony to this possibility, deliveringenormous amounts of power that might not have been capable with immense amountsof batteries.But what would the purpose of the utilization of two types of electricalpotentials be?To answer this question, we must again return to Witkowski’s very crediblerationalization of the Bell’s scientific principles:Yes, plasma sometimes creates a kind of vortex, but this is usually a sideeffect. Nobody yet, nobody after the war — has built a “plasma focus” devicechiefly for the fast spinning of heavy ions…the internal construction of everyplasma is purely static. The conception of rotating or counterrotating cylindersremains unknown. Nobody has struck upon the idea of doing this!518[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-518]I imagined a large, metal drum, in which a small amount of mercury was present.The drum would then be accelerated to a speed of say tens of thousands ofrevolutions per minute. Under the influence of the centrifugal force themercury, as a liquid, would cover the walls of the drum creating a thin layer.After achieving the target speed a high voltage electrical discharge would becreated between the circumference of the drum (the mercury layer) — and its axis— the core. Theoretically this would accelerate the ions of mercury towards thecore, with a speed of many kilometers per second. But since the mercury wouldalready possess a certain torque, in due measure of approaching the core itsangular velocity would increase … thus developing an increase in rotationalspeed. In the case of the drum with mercury this would lead to an overlapping ofthe two speeds — created by a preservation of the torque and a result of theflow of electric current. From my approximate calculations it followed that bythis means it would be possible to achieve a speed of the ultimate “compressed”vortex of the order of even hundreds of thousands of revolutions per second.519[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-519]So far, so good, but as I noted in my book Secrets of the Unified Field, thisrationalizes the rotation but not the counter-rotation of the drums.520[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-520]If such effects were achieved with counter-rotating drums nested one inside theother, then this would have created a kind of sheer effect within the deviceitself, a kind of “temporal neutral zone” between the two counterrotating drumsand the stationary core of the device. Thus, the whole device would not havebeen within this zone, a rather self-defeating exercise if the goal were boththe manipulation of space-time and the creation of a field propulsiontechnology.Hence I argued that the possible configuration of the drums was one on top ofthe other. Here the effect of the discharge is different, while the principlesunderlying Witkowski’s analysis remain the same, for the “neutral zone” iscreated along two axes: between the drums and the stationary core, parallel tothe rotational axis of the drums, or “vertically” so to speak, and a horizontalzone between the drums, extending beyond the device in the plane perpendicularto the rotational axis. Again, the analogy of wringing the soda pop can comes tomind, for the area of maximum stress will be precisely on the rotational planeperpendicular to the axis of rotation.One may extend the speculative analysis further, in a much more speculativedirection. With a high-viscosity, low-stability metal such as mercury, the highspin of the drums will have two possible effects: first, it will squish thenuclei of atoms — or better, the mercuric ions and plasma — into one of thenuclear deformities of high-spin-state atoms, similar to those discussed in theseries of papers referenced by David Hudson. This will in turn induce the “newradioactivities” and models of fission that recent physics papers — decadesafter the war! — have observed and recounted. Secondly, this high-spin-state ofan ionized plasma will in turn produce an electrical charge according to thespin orientation of the nuclei. Note now what happens to the relationship of theplasmas and compounds being spun in the two drums: a slight charge differentialis built up between the two, with the intervening “neutral zone” betweenthem!521 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-521] If the top drum isspun to create a positive charge, and the bottom one a negative one, thedifference will possibly produce a levitation effect, exactly as witnessesdescribed seeing in the Bell’s test environs, when they described seeing paleblue barrel-like objects floating in the sky.With sudden and repeated discharges of high-voltage DC current from the drums tothe stationary core, all other principles remain more or less as Witkowskidescribed, with one additional possible effect. Such discharges would amount ineffect to a “sudden stoppage” of the rotation of the ions, releasing enormousamounts of energy as, for a brief moment, they lost their angular momentum. Thisenergy would be released most likely in the form of very high frequencyradiation: X-rays and gamma rays, in a fashion similar to Hudson’s observedgamma bursts from his high-spin-state platinum group metals, in a kind of“torsion bomb.”In other words, the principle rationalization in evidence once again is that ofmaximizing the sheer effect of torsion in three dimensions — and not the onedimension implied by Witkowski’s analysis — by any practical means availablewith 1940s technology. With all of the massive and repeated “short-circuiting”that such a system deliberately designed into it, it is little wonder that theBell gave off the characteristic buzzing and hissing sound when in operationthat earned it its nickname of the Beehive.If we now assume that the central stationary core was the one utilizing analternating and a direct current on the drums, with the central core given apositive and the drums a negative charge relative to each other, even more sheereffect is created.Of course, the electrical engineering of all this would have been complicated,given the charge differentials, two types of electrical potentials, and the highvoltages involved, and would have required someone with an expertise in suchthings, and with handling tricky high-voltage direct current and its accuratemeasurement and control.Someone like Dr. Kurt Debus, the Bell’s powerplant designer, and subsequent NASAApollo flight director.A. A CURIOUS PARALLEL: THE VARO ANNOTATED EDITIONThe idea of a sudden high voltage direct current pulse of a magnetic vortex —one of the principles possibly in operation in the Bell to maximize torsionalsheer — is one that is found in another very unusual place: in the VaroAnnotated edition of early UFOlogist Dr. Morris K. Jessup’s The Case for theUFOs, the annotated edition of the book being the ultimate source for the originof the Philadelphia Experiment. While an extensive review of that book and itsrelationship to the physics explored here in connection with the Nazi Bell isnot possible,522 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-522] there isone reference that the anonymous annotators make in direct regard to suchconcepts, though little hint is given whence they — clearly not educated asscientists — could have gained it.What happens when a bolt of lightning hits at a point where there is a “node”such as a “swirl” in the magnetic sea or where a mag.

Sea contra gravity especially, what,when the node & bolt both act over bronze inlay.523[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-523]As I remarked there, “interestingly, this annotation seems to hint at some sortof effect achieved by pulsing the center of a magnetic vortex with extremelyhigh-voltage electrostatics….While it is very unlikely that the annotators ofthe Varo Edition, whoever they were, knew of the Nazi Bell project, it is anintriguing comment for them to make.”524[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-524]B. ANOTHER CURIOUS PARALLEL: LYNE AND TESLAAccording to researcher William Lyne, similar ideas — using two types ofelectrical potential in charge differentials — were also at the heart of NikolaTesla’s idea for an electrical airplane:Lyne, summarizing Tesla’s views on the aether and electrical circuits as opensystems, notes that electrical motive force is not due merely to “varyingcurrents” but to “rarefaction and compression of the ether” brought about byrapidly varying and different kinds of currents.525[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-525] The implication was that,while as early as 1884 Tesla had done calculations for his flying machine whenhe first immigrated to the United States,526[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-526] he later claimed that his“dirigible torpedo” could achieve speeds of 300 miles per second, or anincredible 1,080,000 miles per hour!527[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-527]The idea of the compression and rarefaction of the aether via electrical stresscaused by two types of electrical potential, coupled with the idea of thestructure of matter being nothing but vorticular motion in that aether, makesTesla’s views far ahead of their time.528[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-528]This is strange company indeed — the Varo annotators, Nikola Tesla, and theNazis — but nonetheless, it is the same principle that unites them all:utilization of two types of electrical potential and charge differential at highvoltages. And notably, Tesla’s utilization of it was allegedly for the expresspurpose of an “electrical” airplane.3. CRYOGENIC COOLING AND SUPERCONDUCTORSA third principle in evidence in the Bell is that of its cryogenic cooling,either by liquid nitrogen or oxygen. This property, as is well known, is acomponent of superconductors, for the extremely low temperatures lowerelectrical resistance to the point that electrical current circulates “freely”and for all intents and purposes “forever.” Another property of superconductorsrecently observed is also their tendency — as Hudson observed — to lose weight.This is another indicator of how thoroughly the Nazis had scientificallyrationalized the project, and is also another indication that the principle inevidence again is to maximize a torsion sheer effect when the whirling,super-cooled Xerum 525 was electrically pulsed.A. PROFESSOR NAGAOKA’S OBSERVATIONBut there is another fact that should be recalled.In our previous examination of the “alchemical” experiments of transmutations ofminute quantities mercury into gold that were part of the science of the 1920s,it will be remembered that Japanese physicist Nagaoka observed that “In order tobe sure of transmutation, repeated purification of (mercury) by distilling invacuum at temperatures below 200° essential.”529[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-529] Since the paper regardinghis experiment was published in the prestigious German scientific journalNaturwissenschaften the reference could hardly have been lost on the Naziscientists, especially since Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach had himself written anarticle concerning this “alchemy,” since his specialty was spin, gravity, andmagnetic resonance, and even more especially since he was the Bell project’sscientific head!B. A BRIEF NOTE ON THE BELL AND NAZI CENTRIFUGE ISOTOPE SEPARATION TECHNOLOGIESSome have proposed that the Bell was actually nothing other than an advancedform of the Nazi centrifuge isotope separation technologies. While notsubscribing to this view as the Bell’s ultimate purpose or design, it does raiseinteresting questions. What exactly happened to its mysterious fuel, Serum 525,while being spun and electrically pulsed inside the Bell? Given all that hasbeen learned about high-spin states and the actual construction and possibleinternal arrangement of the Bell’s counter-rotating cylinders, it is justremotely feasible that some of its most classified results might indeed havebeen unusual transmutations of the Serum’s constituent elements and theirradioactive properties.4. THE OPERATIVE PRINCIPLE IN EVIDENCE THUS FAR: MAXIMIZING TORSION SHEEREFFECTS IN THE MEDIUMSo, putting all of this together, what do we have?We have:1. The super-cooling of the device, to greatly lower electrical resistance andincrease the spin state of the Serum being rotated;2. The mechanical high spin itself;3. The counter-rotation of the substance in two drums, possibly arranged one ontop of the other;4. The possible rationalization of the device in a modified form of Kaluza’sunified field theory, one which incorporated torsion in a cylindrical geometry;5. The possible use of two types of electrical potential — alternating anddirect current — in the device under conditions of high-voltage stress of theSerum.Throughout all of these things, one principle stands out as the probable basisfor all these things, and that is that every conceivable effect and artifice wasemployed in order to maximize a torsion sheer effect in the physical medium ofspace-time itself.C. THE ALCHEMICAL SERUM: THE PROVISIONAL ROLE OF “IRR XERUM 525” IN LIGHT OF THEPREVIOUS ANALYSISWith this principle in hand, it is an easy and short logical deduction to theconclusion that the mysterious compound, the “fuel” of the Bell, was asessential a component in the actual operation of the device and the achievementof the sought-after effects as all the others, namely, that the substance hadbeen specifically designed and confected to maximize and possibly also tomeasure this torsion sheer effect at one and the same time.1. THE THORIUM AND RADIUM MYSTERIESIn order to argue this case, one must return to a little-noticed comment of IgorWitkowski in his magisterial The Truth About the Wunderwaffe concerning theactual chemical composition of the compound.Before each trial some kind of ceramic, oblong container was placed in the core(it was defined as a “vacuum flask”…), surrounded by a layer of lead approx. 3cm thick. It was approx. 1–1.5 m long and filled with a strange, metallicsubstance, with a violet-gold hue and preserving at room temperature theconsistency of “slightly coagulated jelly.” From the produced information itfollowed that this substance was code-named “IRR XERUM-525” or “IRR SERUM-525”and contained among other constituents the thorium oxide and beryllium oxide(beryllia). The name “Xeron” also appeared in the documentation. It was somekind of amalgam of mercury, probably containing various heavy isotopes.Mercury, this time already in pure form, was also present inside the spinningcylinders. Before the start of each experiment, and perhaps also for itsduration, the mercury was intensively cooled. Since information appeared aboutthe use of large quantities of liquid gas — nitrogen and oxygen, it appearedthat it was precisely these that were the cooling medium. The entire device,i.e., the cylinders and core was covered with the aforementioned ceramichousing, of a bell-like shape — a cylinder rounded at the top crowned with somekind of hook, or fastening. The entire device was about 1.5 m in diameter andabout 2.5 m high...530 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-530].With respect to beryllium oxide and thorium oxide, it is worth recalling thatthe Nazi obsession with the elements was something of a mystery to the Allied“Alsos” intelligence teams entering the Reich and scouring it for every trace ofevidence concerning Nazi nuclear projects. Indeed, this obsession with thorium(and radium) is one of the enduring mysteries of the war, as Witkowski relates:“…the U.S. Alsos mission was unable to explain the high role of thorium in theGerman research.”531 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-531]But why thorium and radium amalgams with mercury?A. ONE EXPLANATION: THORIUM ISOMERSThe answer lies, once again, with the particular form of high-spin states ofnuclei known as isomers. As was seen in the examination of Hudson’s anomalousplatinum group metals in part two, such high-spin superdeformed nuclei have avariety of odd, asymmetrical shapes. Interestingly enough, elements in theradium to thorium range take what are known as “octupole” shapes, and have lowexcitation thresholds to reach their isomeric, high-spin, high-energy state. 532[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-532]Even more significant is a recent discovery emanating from Lawrence LivermoreLaboratory. Researcher Anne Stark, in an article entitled “Researchers MoveCloser to Switching Nuclear Isomer Decay On and Off,” mentioned some unusualproperties of a thorium isomer. It is best to cite her actual words, in order toallow the full significance of the discovery to be exhibited in the light of theprevious chapters:Researchers at Livermore studied an isomer of Thorium-229. This isomer is uniquein that its excitation energy is near optical energies, implying that one dayscientists may be able to transition Th229 nuclei between the ground andisomeric states using a table-top laser.For years, researchers have been fascinated with this isomer because it couldlead to new science and technology breakthroughs. Among them are: a quantummany-body study; a clock with unparalleled precision… a superb qubit (a quantumbit) for quantum computing; testing the effects of the chemical environment onnuclear decay rates. Isomers also may serve as a battery for storing largeamounts of energy.533 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-533]Could the Nazis — if they had developed not only solid state optical lasingcavity lasers such as a ruby laser, but rudimentary tunable gas lasers forisotope separation — have noticed this property of thorium-229’s unusual isomer?The evidence arguing in favor of the possible existence of a rudimentary versionof such a laser isotope separation technology inside the Third Reich’s blackprojects has already been presented. This fact, coupled with the unusually highimportance that thorium had in the Nazi nuclear projects, would seem to argue infavor of the answer to that question being a tentative “yes,” for the presenceof thorium oxide within the recipe of the “Nazi Serum” is best rationalized bythe Nazis having discovered its peculiarly low excitation states.Moreover, its isomeric, high-spin state, in an amalgam with mercury, would alsobe another example of the Serum’s deliberate confection as a substance tomaximize the torsion sheer effects evident in the other operating and designparameters of the Bell. Moreover, it is conceivable, given Serum 525’sreddish-violet color and high density, that it was perhaps a precursor to thewhole “Red Mercury” story and perhaps in its own right a powerful “ballotechnicexplosive.”But there is another clue in the article just cited, and that is its use notonly as a maximizer of torsion, but as a measurer of it.B. ANOTHER HIGHLY SPECULATIVE EXPLANATION: SUPER-DENSE MATTERBut there is another highly speculative explanation, one that deserves mentionin spite of its extremely low probability. Here again, one is confronted withthe supreme mystery of just how radical the Nazi quest for superweapons reallywas.The mystery begins with something I discovered when writing my book on the Naziatom bomb project, Reich of the Black Sun. The mystery was found in a Japanesecommuniqué from the Imperial military attaché to the Japanese Embassy inStockholm to Tokyo, a communiqué intercepted and decoded by the Allies in 1944just prior to the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge (Dec. 16, 1944). Thecommuniqué outlined what Japanese intelligence had learned about German atombomb research, research that the communiqué leaves no doubt is in a high stateof development, and not the eviscerated lackadaisical effort that the postwarAllied Legend of Nazi nuclear incompetence would have one believe.But then, toward the end of the communiqué, a stunning passage occurs,indicating that the Nazis were after more than just mere atom bombs:Naturally, there have been plenty of examples even before this of successfulattempts at smashing individual atoms. However, Part 5. as far as thedemonstration of any practical results is concerned, they seem not to have beenable to split large numbers of atoms in a single group. That is, they requirefor the splitting of each single atom a force that will disintegrate theelectron orbit.On the other hand, the stuff that the Germans are using has, apparently, a verymuch greater specific gravity than anything heretofore used. In this connection,allusions have been made to SIRIUS and stars of the “White Dwarf” group. (Theirspecific gravity is (?6>) 1 thousand, and the weight of one cubic inch is 1ton.) 534 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-534]While I did not comment at length on this passage in Reich of the Black Sun, itis prudent to do so here.Note what the Japanese communiqué actually says:1. The Germans were actually using some sort of material with a great “specificgravity. Given that the Japanese military attaché probably did not have morethan a passing knowledge of physics, he is using the most accurate term he couldthink of to describe the substance. But an important, though radical, clue isafforded in his next statement:2. That the material has some connection to white dwarf stars and to super-densematter.So, putting it together, what the communiqué is saying is that the Germans weretrying to come up with a super-explosive, not via the “conventional” routes ofnuclear fission or thermonuclear fusion, but via super-dense matter.The idea for a super-dense explosive as the fuel for a bomb was certainly notforeign to the Nazi way of rationalizing physics, for as I noted in Reich of theBlack Sun,Was first patented prior to World War II in Austria, and a modification of theidea was patented in Germany in 1943.535[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-535] Its inventor, Dr. KarlNowak, explained the reason for his invention as being to create a superbombwithout the radioactive fallout effects that were evident from atomic andthermonuclear explosions!536[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-536] In other words, the Naziswere already looking past the thermonuclear age toward the creation of secondand third generation weapons systems that would give the same offensive andstrategic “punch” but without the side effects! In theory, the bomb is workable,but was way beyond the technological capabilities of Germany, or any otherpower, in that time period.These ideas, of course, recall the alleged “ballotechnic” properties of RedMercury. But here there is an important difference, for the Japanese communiquémakes it clear that, whatever the material’s density was that the Germans wereusing, it was of a density of matter not normally encountered on Earth. Grantedthat it is highly unlikely if not downright implausible that the Germans laidtheir hands on super-dense “white dwarf star” matter during the war much less amaterial that would weigh a ton per cubic inch, the Japanese attaché isnonetheless very clear that it is of a density far greater than any then knownor discovered element. So, if they did in fact possess some sort of super-densematter, what was it?The answer, once again, lies with thorium and with some highly unusual claimsfor it that a group of scientists has only recently made.On April 29, 2008, Fox News reported that scientists may have found traces ofthe super-heavy element 122 (called Unbibium, with the chemical symbol Ubb), andmoreover, the element was extremely stable, unlike most super-heavy elementswhich decay in a matter of a few parts of a second, and moreover, that theyfound traces of this element occurring naturally, and in thorium.537[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-537] Of course, almostimmediately “mainstream science” stepped in and denounced the results, callinginto question the scientists’ methods, alleging either faulty equipment, faultysampling, faulty methodology, and/or erroneous conclusions.538[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-538]But the authors of the scientific paper making the claim refuse to back off fromtheir assertions and findings, notwithstanding the rejection of their paper bysuch prestigious scientific journals as Nature. Indeed, the scientists making itform a broad international team of eight people, representing Israel, Sweden,France, and two Germans (of course), and two Americans. The paper itself isentitled “Evidence for a long-lived superheavy nucleus with atomic mass numberA=292 and atomic number Z≅ in natural Th.” In other words, these scientistsclaim to have found very minute amounts of element 122, Unbibium, occurring innatural thorium!It is what the abstract and the paper itself says, however, that is even morebreathtaking:Evidence for the existence of a superheavy nucleus with atomic mass number A=292and abundance (1-10) x 10-12 relative to 232Th has been found in a study ofnatural Th using inductively coupled plasma-sector field mass spectrometry. Themeasured mass matches the predictions for the mass of an isotope with atomicnumber Z=122 or a nearby element. Its estimated half-life of t½ >108 (years)suggests that a long-lived isomeric state exists in this isotope. Thepossibility that it might belong to a new class of long-lived high-spin super-and hyperdeformed isomeric states is discussed.The question “how heavy can a nucleus be” is a fundamental problem in nuclearphysics. Experimentally, elements up to Z=118 have been produced syntheticallyby heavy-ion reactions, with the half-lives of the Z=106 to 118 nuclei rangingfrom a few minutes to about a millisecond. However, in a recent study of natural(thorium) substances, long-lived isomeric states with estimated half-lives (of100,000,000 years), 16 to 22 orders of magnitude longer than their correspondingground states have been observed in the neutron-deficient 211,213,217,218(thorium nuclei).539 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-539]Note carefully what the authors of this paper are asserting:(1) A super-dense element — Unbibium or element 122 — may exist in naturalthorium in extremely minute quantities (from 1 part in a quadrillion to 1 partin 100 trillion);(2) The longevity of that element, the feature that makes it stable overmillions of years, is its isomeric state, that is, its stability is gained byits shape and high-speed rotation; and,(3) The element was isolated by more or less standard mass spectrographymethods.And note the implication:(4) If the element is stable for millions of years and separable by “standard”methods of mass spectrography, then theoretically one might accumulatequantities of the element by stockpiling vast amounts of thorium and separatingthe unbibium from it.So, what if mainstream science is wrong, and the authors of the paper are right?Moreover, what if the Nazis, utilizing some prototypical technology of laserisotope separation and mass spectrography, the latter technology which theycertainly possessed, had also noticed something very similar? After all, theirown scientist and one of Gerlach’s most brilliant students, Dr. Ing. OttChristian Hilgenberg, had predicted the occurrence of superheavy elements.540[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-540]However one chooses to view the Nazi obsession with stockpiling massive amountsof thorium, it is clear that their obsession with the element cannot berationalized on the basis of standard nuclear physics. Indeed, as was alreadyseen, this was what most mystified the Allied intelligence and scientific teamsentering Nazi Germany and searching for clues into its nuclear program. In fact,there is no good way to rationalize it other than one of the two previouslymentioned alternatives, and notably, both of these alternatives involve the highrotational state of isomers. And let it also be noted that the extremelyhigh-spin state of isomers is also the best candidate to explain the crypticreferences to Nazi use of super-dense matter in their experiments.There is likewise another possibility that Unbibium also opens up. As wasmentioned in part one of this work, one attribute claimed for the Philosophers’Stone — and indeed for the ancient Sumerian “Tablets of Destinies” that formedsuch a technological centerpiece of an ancient “Cosmic War”541[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-541] — was precisely itsindestructibility. A super-dense matter on the order of unbibium or any otherisomeric stable state matter would also qualify for indestructibility.”2. HOAGLAND’S MEASUREMENT MODEL: TORSION EFFECTS, RADIOACTIVE DECAY RATES ANDSHIELDING, AND A PROPOSALDuring the course of our email discussions on the Farm Hall Transcripts andlaser isotope separation, Mr. Hoagland also mentioned a possible rationalizationof the Bell’s Xerum 525. On this view, he argued that it was less a “fuel” forthe device, and more of an exact measuring device for the amount of torsionsheer and temporal displacements the device actually produced. Again, this viewis fully accounted for by the Lawrence Livermore discoveries outlined above.Under the normal conditions of radioactive or isomeric decay back into anelement’s ordinary ground state, such decays are precisely measurable in termsof time. Thus, if extreme torsion and temporal displacements occur, the besttool for measuring them would be via changes in rates of radioactive decay.Under the conditions of the extreme torsion sheer effect being argued as thebasic principle of the Bell’s operation, however, such decay rates woulddramatically change, and under certain conditions, radioactive shieldingproperties could even result.Consequently, there is much to commend Mr. Hoagland’s hypothesis. Indeed, if onefollows Witkowski’s analysis carefully, this “Serum” was placed within the“thermos bottle” at the Bell’s stationary core and axis of rotation, aneminently logical position for a “measuring compound” to occupy. In thatposition, its high-spin properties are not being employed to further maximizethe torsion sheer effect operative in the device.However, it is this very property that also argues that the Serum was also thefuel of the Bell, with its high-spin mechanical rotation in conjunction with thepossible presence of thorium-229 isomer, the principle of maximizing torsionsheer would again be in evidence. Thus, the best way for the substance tofunction as a measurer is if it were present both in the core and in therotating drums, where, under the extreme conditions of Kozyrev-like “alchemical”stress that it was subjected to in the Bell, any number of strangetransmutations and effects may have been observed by the Nazi scientists, amongthem possibly bursts of gamma ray radiation and asymmetrical nuclear fissiontransmutations associated with high-spin state elements.3. A PROTOTYPICAL TECHNOLOGY AND THREE POTENTIAL APPLICATIONSViewed in all this context, it is together that the Bell and its “fuel,” thealchemical Nazi Serum 525, represent a prototypical technology of a “unified”physics, a technology that like the physics itself was a “unified” technologycapable of a variety of potential applications: first, for “free energy” drawnfrom the medium of space-time itself via a hyper-dimensional “torsion gate” thatthe two constituted.But it is equally the case, if the above speculations and arguments be true,that the two technologies of the Bell and Serum 525 also represent the firstprototypical steps toward a field propulsion technology, via the approach ofmaximizing a torsion sheer effect to manipulate the fabric of space-time. AsWitkowski so concisely and brilliantly observes, such a new physics was not onlynecessary for any really practical manned exploration of deep space, but it wasalso signally important for a much more immediate reason: only “a propulsionbased on a new physics…was the only thing that could change the course of thewar!”542 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-542] The need for anew, hyper-dimensional physics had been foreseen by the Nazis, not only as theonly sound basis for deep space manned missions, but ultimately, for their plansfor global domination as well.But there is a final potential application of the Bell and its Serum 525 “fuel,”and that is as not only a weapons platform, but as a weapon, for a technologycapable of engineering the fabric of space-time for energy independence andfield propulsion is also a technology with a horrific weaponization potential,one that would dwarf the destructive power of the largest thermonuclearbombs.543 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-543] Indeed, if eitherof the speculations concerning thorium above were at work in the Nazi obsessionwith the element, then its role as a possible constituent — given its high-spinisomeric state — in the Serum 525 is virtually assured, since the Bell itselfwas a device reliant upon high-speed rotation.Indeed, if the enigmatic Serum 525 was a compound of mercury and thorium-229isomer oxide, then its alchemical reddish-purple color, its heavy goo-likeliquidity under ordinary room temperature, would make it the ideal candidate forthe type of “ballotechnic” explosive in its own right later claimed for theSoviet “Red Mercury” scare of the 1990s. And given that the Soviets made offwith their own fair share of the Nazi technological spoils, the possibility thatit may even have formed the basis for the subsequent Red Mercury legend andpossible Soviet investigations and synthesis of similar compounds cannot bediscounted. Moreover, as will be seen in the next chapter, there is a tenuouscircumstantial case that one of postwar Germany’s most brilliant physicists mayhave been involved in wartime research of precisely that nature. Serum 525 istestament to the fact that the alchemical Reich may very well have succeeded inall these aims for the Bell project.D. THE MYSTERY OF TWO MORE SCIENTISTSBut there is more to the mysteries of the strange compound than just itschemical composition and uses inside the Bell, and this concerns the case of twomore little-known, but very significant scientists. They are the medical doctorHubertus Strughold, subsequently an Operation Paperclip scientist who ended upin an influential position within NASA’s space medicine community, and thelittle-known but highly important Dr. Pascual Jordan, one of the key developersof quantum mechanics. Both were strong supporters of the Nazi regime, and thework of both in the secret projects of the Third Reich are virtually unknown tothis day. And once again, it is thanks to the penetrating and brilliant researchand insights of Igor Witkowski that the connection of either man to the Bellproject has even been surmised or suggested.1. THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. HUBERTUS STRUGHOLDWithin the rats’ run of secret underground SS installations in Lower Silesiaaround the test environs of the Bell, there was one in particular that appearedto be connected to the medical arm of the Bell project, that arm which sought toinvestigate its effects and means of limiting them on humans. There was,Witkowski writes, “an experimental test station to test the control system ofthe new flying craft and its influence on humans–mentally disabled children,directed by Hubertus Strughold (all in or near Fürstenstein bei Waldenburg)...”544 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-544]Castle Fürstenstein was one of the centers connected to the Bell project, andindeed, there are large underground bunkers located beneath the castle and itsenvirons. Interestingly enough, Witkowski also referred to an interview that Dr.Strughold gave to the Polish author Kakolewski in the 1960s, in which he statedthat he had indeed carried out experiments during the first part of 1945 “inFürstenstein” and with “a simulator of space flight,” presumably a centrifuge orpressure chamber.545 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-545] Thesignificance of Strughold’s involvement in medical experimentation within one ofthe installations and centers directly connected with the Bell project will beexamined at the end of this chapter.For now, however, it is important to note that it is in this context thatWitkowski summarizes the actual size of the Bell project. It was not merely alaboratory project encompassing only one installation, and one device. Rather,if one combines it and all the other super secret classified SS black projectsbeing undertaken by the Kammler Group within and around the Reichprotektorat ofBohemia and Moravia and Lower Silesia, then “we will get an undertaking thatemployed (with the Gross-Rosen [concentration camp] prisoners) well over 60,000people — in fact, something that seems to be the real equivalent of the AmericanManhattan Project. From my perspective, however, it’s much more important forquite another reason — it may, potentially, enable us to understand thetechnology crucial for the future, a completely different approach to gravity,the ‘gateway to the stars.’”546[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-546] And with the presence ofDr. Hubertus Strughold at Fürstenstein Castle, and later within NASA’s spacemedicine program, one has a further clue into the mystery of its strangelyinfluential Nazis.And let us take note of one implication of Strughold in connection with theBell: extreme torsion can alter the normal decay rates of radioactive materials.Thus, if the Bell was doing so, then one significant technology was openingitself to the Nazis for the possibility of radioactive shielding.547[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-547]2. THE EVEN STRANGER CASE OF PASCUAL JORDANThere is, however, an even stranger case of a scientist from Nazi Germany, andthat is Dr. Pascual Jordan, who, along with Heisenberg, Schrödinger and a fewothers, was one of the seminal contributors to the early development of quantummechanics. And with Jordan, we are truly confronted with a significant enigma.Once again, it is Witkowski who ferreted out his possible connection to the Bellproject:It seems likely that yet another scientist played some role in this project,although his name did not appear in the original interrogation protocols; hisunique works could constitute part of the theoretical basis of the experiments.It’s about professor Pascual Jordan, one of the most outstanding physicists ofthe Third Reich (whose career was as enigmatic as Gerlach’s!). During the war heworked on a theory which described the phenomenon of “separation of magneticfields,” linking the isolation of magnetic fields with gravitational effects.Shortly after the war it was “perfected” and combined with the works of anotherscientist — presently it is known as the Jordan-Thiry theory. It is consideredas one of the most fundamental achievements of the XXth century physics andJordan was an almost certain candidate to receive the Nobel prize in 1954.Eventually, however, he was disqualified after his role during the war wasrevealed… the Jordan-Thiry theory forms the basis to analyze relativistic plasmavortices...548 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-548]But this does not constitute the real mystery of Jordan’s work during the war.Part of the mystery consists of the fact that, in spite of being one of thefundamental founders of quantum mechanics and having authored a number ofimportant papers and even textbooks in the subject, he abandoned the subjectprior to the war, and switched to cosmological physics, beginning to elaborateconcepts that would eventually lead to his theory that all the fundamentalconstants of physics were variable over time — shades of Kozyrev!A. HIS MYSTERIOUS ABSENCE FROM WARTIME NAZI SECRET WEAPONS RESEARCHBut the biggest mystery of Jordan was the fact that he was a Nazi, and that,being one of Germany’s most brilliant theoretical physicists, he was — so thepublic legend goes — never a major participant in any of the Third Reich’sadvanced black projects. Joining the Nazi party in May of 1933 he subsequentlyenlisted in the notorious Brown Shirts, the Sturmabteilung or S.A of Ernst Röhm.By 1939 he had enlisted in the Luftwaffe and did some minor work at thePeenemünde rocket development center.However, Jordan was not merely a “joiner,” but a true believer. His “convictionthat the ‘Bolshevist peril’ had to be eradicated drove him into the arms of theNazis.”549 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-549] In spite ofhaving offered the Nazi government a number of proposals for advanced weaponsprojects, Jordan was ignored, or at least, that is the story:This ideological support remained one-sided since (the Nazis) never rewarded himwith a leading position in their weapons research program as they did many othercases. During the 30s, after the Nazis took power, he became increasinglyisolated even within the German physics community…. This explains why severalimportant contributions by Jordan which were ahead of times went unnoticed.550[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-550]There are several ways to construe Jordan’s conspicuous absence from Nazissecret weapons projects.The first, and most obvious, is that he was ignored not only for his seminalrole in the development of quantum mechanics but for his close association withJewish physicists during the pre-Nazi era. Such ideas and associations wouldhave made him anathema to the “Aryan Physics’ ideology being promoted by Lenardand Stark, and a potential “security risk” to the SS which oversaw the secretweapons projects.Such an explanation, however, ignores two salient facts: Jordan’s brilliance,and the SS Kammler Group’s willingness to suspend normal required adherence toNazi ideological proscriptions, for the potential reward that “out-of-the-boxthinking,” of which Jordan was certainly a master, could bring. Simply put, itdoes not stand to reason that the Nazis, or rather, the SS, would not have madeuse of him, and probably in some highly classified project.The second explanation is that Jordan was not made privy to the highest secretsfor much the same reason that Heisenberg and other high-profile scientists werenot: being such a well-known scientist would have made Jordan a high targetpriority for capture or assassination by the Allies. To have entrusted sensitivesecrets to him would have placed those secrets at risk of compromise in theevent he was captured by the Allies and tortured for information.But again, the explanation fails, not only for the previously cited reasons, butalso for the fact Jordan, after joining the Nazi party, appeared only toowilling to abandon quantum mechanics and to pursue the cosmological ideas thatwould eventually lead to his formulation of the idea that the constants ofphysics were variable over time, a conception quite in keeping with the physicsimplied by the Bell.And time variability, as Dr. Kozyrev demonstrated so amply, was an effect oftorsion.Moreover, Dr. Pascual Jordan could read the paper of Kaluza, and do themathematics of the torsion tensor, as well as anyone of his day.This leads us inevitably to the third, and I believe the most plausible,explanation, namely, that the public version of his non-involvement withsensitive Nazi secret weapons projects was just that, a public version promotedto deflect attention away from the fact that his theories dovetailed perfectlywith the conceptual parameters of the Bell project, and that he was, asWitkowski avers, not only possibly involved with it, but probably involved withit. And as will be seen in the next chapter, Jordan surfaces in a most unusualconnection in the postwar period, along with, of all people, Dr. Wernher VonBraun!B. A CONNECTION TO HILGENBERG AND GERLACH?A final speculative connection must be mentioned. As noted, Jordan began toshift to cosmology and to develop views that would eventually lead him toconclude that the constants of physics, including that of gravity itself, werevariable over time. In terms of planetary physics, then, this implies the viewthat a planet’s gravity changes over time because its mass changes as torsionalenergy enters the planet via the now familiar mechanism of its rotation.The linkage between changing mass, gravity and such rotating systems had, infact, also been made by one of Dr. Walther Gerlach’s most brilliant and giftedstudents, Dr. Ing. Ott Christian Hilgenberg, in a series of prewar papers.Central to Hilgenberg’s ideas was even the idea that the earth itself wasgradually growing and expanding as a result of these factors. And Gerlachhimself was, as we now know, not only the Bell’s project head, but also a closefriend to the Austrian physicist Lense, who had predicted dragging effects of(the then theoretical idea of) objects in earth’s orbit, effects which resultedfrom its rotation. With such rich conceptual soil on which to grow projects likethe Bell, and with the close-knit nature of the German physics community priorto the war, it stands to reason that Jordan would have been aware of hiscolleague’s thoughts, and they of his.If Walther Gerlach, ardent supporter of the Nazi regime though he was, was nevera member of the Nazi party, and if, with his own close association with “Jewishphysics” and Jewish physicists before the Nazi assumption of power — after all,his partner in the famous Stern-Gerlach experiment that earned him his NobelPrize was Jewish! — and if, finally, his own spirited defense of relativity andquantum mechanics against “Aryan physics” was not enough to disqualify him fromheading the Bell project and eventually even the Nazi atom bomb project, then ithardly stands to reason that Jordan, not only a Nazi Party member but a memberof the SA and the Luftwaffe, would be excluded from such projects.E. CONCLUSIONS AND SPECULATIONSIt has been argued that Dr. Hubertus Strughold was possibly a member of theBell’s medical research team. If so, then the presence both of Dr. HubertusStrughold and of Dr. Kurt Debus within NASA is a strong indicator that a secretand rudimentary anti-gravity or “electro-gravity” technology was possibly inplay during the Apollo program. Moreover, the fact that Strughold may have beeninvolved in medical experimentation to limit the Bell’s and Xerum 525’s toxicand lethal field effects on humans — using luckless concentration camp victimsin his experiments — and the fact that these experiments appear to have had somelimited success, further buttresses the Two Space Programs hypothesis, an overtone for public consumption, and a covert one based on advanced secrettechnology, a two-track space program that began during World War II, if notbefore.One area of crucial applicability of this speculation is the so-called “ApolloHoax” hypothesis, namely, that we never went to the Moon at all. Many haveerroneously concluded that the program was hoaxed because of the allegedlethality of passing through the Van Allen radiation belts to any humans soweakly shielded from its effects as in the Apollo Command Module. Granting thisproposition for the sake of argument, the presence of a torsion- or scalar-basedrudimentary anti-gravity technology within NASA, a technology based on that ofthe Nazis, then one effect of such technology would be to radically alter whatfor public consumption physics are the unalterable decay rates of radioactivity,and a technology that additionally can shield against it. If the Bell and its“fuel,” Serum 525, could indeed create a kind of “space-time bubble” around thedevice, then it follows that one and the same technology as got us off the Moonmight also have got us through the Van Allen Belts and to the Moon.Hubertus Strughold, like Kurt Debus, is another potential clue that somethingelse is going on within NASA and other American programs besides mere rockets,and that “something else” has been going on since the end of the war. Theirpresence also indicates that the Nazis were, to some extent, exercisinginfluence and control over its development, even in postwar America.For the technological, historical, and political implications of the Bell, ofSerum 525, and of their implied physics are as clear now as they would have beento the rocket-ridden Nazis then: if there ever is to be a practical humanpresence and penetration into deep space, then another technology and physicsfrom mere rockets is altogether necessary. It is a sine qua non for such apresence. This would have been as clear to the Nazis then, as it is to us now,and as we shall see in the next chapter, as it is finally publicly, thoughquietly, admitted by NASA.Thus the implication is as disturbing as it is speculative: it would appear thatthe postwar Two Space Programs hypothesis had its beginning in World War IIitself, with the Nazis rockets representing, as they did for the postwarAmerican and Soviet programs, the “public consumption” program, and the exoticblack projects in anti-gravity, torsion, and the manipulation of the fabric ofspace and time representing the black one.But is there any further proof that the Germans would have scientificallyrationalized things to this extreme extent during the course of the war?While there is no direct proof, there is a very intriguing case of alittle-known German physicist who began thinking along similar lines shortlyafter the war, and who did unusual work for the Nazis during the war, work thatno one seems to know anything about, but which cost him his hands, his sight,and his hearing, but that left him with his genius mind…...and he has only in the last decade come to the attention of NASA...…or at least, that is what the public record would have us believe…"},{"pageContent":"13NASA SHOWS AN INTEREST (WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM THE GERMANS)038 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_038_r1.jpg]“A Heim space is a quantized space comprising elemental surfaces withorientation (spin)…A Heim space may comprise several subspaces…”Walter Dröscher and Jochem Häuser551[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-551] It is appropriate to end this survey of the alchemical wedding of physics andancient hermeticism where it began: in the void, but the void not of thetransmutative alchemical medium, but of space. Even here, however, there areconnections between the two voids, and it took a little-known German theoreticalphysicist to make them with formal mathematical precision. This physicist was,moreover, one of those genuine intellectual giants, for his ideas were formedentirely — like Einstein — in his head, but unlike Einstein, forged under muchmore personally limiting circumstances, for he was almost blind and deaf, andhad no hands, all the results of injuries he suffered during a mysteriouswartime accident doing research for the Nazis.The German physicist’s name was Burkhart Heim.And his theory, Heim theory, is a fully geometrized and quantizedhyper-dimensional unified field theory, a modern-day heir to the line ofclassical unified field theories going all the way back to the first suchhyper-dimensional theory of Theodor Kaluza, himself a German mathematician, in1921, and heir as well of the many versions of the unified field theory putforward by Albert Einstein in the 1920s and early 1930s.But as will be seen, with Burkhart Heim’s theory one is dealing with aconceptual framework that in its extraordinary depth and predictive power is notonly an engineerable and testable theory, but a theory that moreover unites thethreads suggested throughout the previous pages. It is a theory withhyper-dimensions, sub-spaces, hyper-spaces, and most important of all, alatticework of a fully quantized spin-oriented space-time itself, able topredict masses of fundamental particles from first principles. All in all, it isa towering monument of a towering intellect, a monument and an intellect madeeven more mysterious because the theory is almost totally neglected outside ofGermany, save in certain quarters.And what of the man and the intellect behind it? The answer to that questioncontains an even greater mystery.039 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_039_r1.jpg]German Theoretical Physicist Burkhart Heim, 1925–2001A. HEIM THEORY1. GETTING ACQUAINTED: THE BOOKI first became acquainted with the name of Burkhart Heim years ago, when readinga book that is now considered to be something of a classic on UFOs, LeonardCramp’s UFOs and Anti-Gravity: Piece for a Jigsaw. Cramp’s book was unusual inthat it was not the typical UFOlogy book, even in its treatment of the possiblescience of UFOs, for it stuck with analysis based on mainstream, thoughlittle-known, physics. And Heim’s name figured prominently in the text:Burkhard Heim, extremely handicapped by war wounds (he is blind, armless andnearly deaf), has evolved a six-dimensional theory containing the generalrelativity theory, and the quantum theory of fields as special cases. Whichmeans that the formalism of these two theories is derived by neglecting certainmembers in Heim’s field equations. Therefore Heim’s theoretical approach has amore universal character than any other presently treated theoretical approach.In addition it bridges some fundamental contradictions between generalrelativity and quantum theory, which tends to restrict them to the macro andmicrocosmic domain. The reader will not be surprised therefore to learn that B.Heim’s six-dimensional theory yields results which predict physical phenomenamentioned elsewhere in this book.552[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-552]This utterly captivated me, for indeed, if Heim had done what Cramp says he did,and did it in only six dimensions — after all some versions of string theory hadup to twenty-six dimensions and were completely untestable — then he had indeedfound the Philosophers’ Stone, the Holy Grail, of modern theoretical physics:the unification of relativity and quantum mechanics. And the clincher that“sold” the theory were the “physical phenomena mentioned elsewhere in thisbook,” namely, the theory predicted a coupling of electromagnetism, and moreimportantly, of magnetism itself, with gravity, with specific anti-gravityimplications.I was “hooked” on the possibility, and read on, wanting to hear more of thislittle-known German physicist. A short while later into Cramp’s book, I foundit:…(It) becomes obvious that we must look to the very core of gravitation if weare ever to accomplish real space flight. No doubt it is such considerations asthese which led Burkhard Heim to develop his six-dimensional field theory. Hisresults concern in particular “mutual relations between the gravitational forceand the matter which generates it.” Heim postulates that since electromagneticwaves are special cases of material fields, then electro-magnetic [sic etpassim] fields must be accompanied by gravitational ones. Heim’s theoreticalinvestigations have shown that the “meso-field” may exist in two states,“contrabaric” and “dynabaric.”When “contrabaric” it is able to transform electro-magnetic waves directly intogravitational ones, it could induce the acceleration of mass from a directconversion of electro-magnetic waves. Heim believes the energy required for thisphenomenon could be derived directly from nuclear processes.Although hitherto Heim focused attention chiefly on the consequences for spaceflight, it becomes obvious that such an identical conversion process could beemployed to generate kinetic energy from electricity without any wastefulintermediate thermodynamic process, that is, practically free from loss.In the “dynabaric” state, the “intermediary field” is inverted so thatelectro-magnetic energy is directly liberated from matter, without accompanyingheat or other waste. Fantastic prospects would result if engineering techniqueswere available to harness the dynabaric state.In addition, it must be stressed, Heim’s approach does not conflict with knownlaws of nature, in fact it strictly agrees with the quantum theory. UFOresearchers will note the parallel with electro-magnetic saucer effects here.Heim’s theory goes on to predict mutual interactions between inertia forces andelectro-magnetic radiations. Einstein said they were equivalent to gravitationalforces….As an open-minded scientist, A.R. Weyl’s following comments will be encouragingto UFO researchers. Writing on Heim’s work he said:“ In Heim’s theory the member which represents electro-magnetic radiation isrelated, by way of an ‘operator’ (that is, an instruction for carrying outdefinite manipulations of computations in an ordered manner), to a ‘spacedensity variable in time.’ It supposes an inertia force of such a kind that theoperator’s treatment of the electro-magnetic radiation produces effects upon theinertia, from the radiation.“If it were possible to realize this ‘operator’ physically, that is to devisemeans which actually carry out the formalistic manipulation of the theory, thedirect transfer of electro-magnetic waves (for example, light) into mechanicalforce (gravitational waves) would become reality, subject to some efficiencyfactor, of course. Also, mass could be directly converted into radiation withoutthe production of heat.“Heim’s intermediary field (represented by the spirit which motivates his‘operator’) would also show the possibility to neutralize or to reversegravitational acceleration…at direct expense of mass-energy, by way of anelectro-magnetic/gravitational conversion which would impose practically noloss. A dynabaric state of the intermediary field should also be capable ofproducing the direct conversion of mass into electro-magnetic energy, withoutheat of the formation of waste products.“If Heim’s conclusions from his comprehensive theory should prove realizable,certain fantastic consequences somewhat of the kind usually ascribed to ‘flyingsaucers’ (including their immunity from the effects of rapid accelerations)would become attainable.“It would also appear possible to propel space vehicles from external sources ofnatural energy, that is, from the conversion of light or other electro-magneticradiation.”553 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-553]This was a very heady wine to imbibe, for note what Cramp has implied with hisremarks:1. Heim appeared to have developed his theory precisely as a response to theneeds for a genuine human presence in deep space, a presence requiring thedevelopment of a wholly new physics paradigm;2. Heim’s hyper-dimensional theory appeared to predict the gravitationalshielding and even anti-gravity effects, which Heim calls by its moretechnically correct term of “contrabary,” effects, moreover, of some states ortypes of matter, shades of the alchemists and of David Hudson’s American“gold”!;3. Space itself had a “density” that was “variable in time,” shades of thealchemists and Nikolai Kozyrev!Beyond these vague generalized assertions, however, Cramp said nothing moreabout Heim theory.So I purposed to find out more about the man and his remarkable theory….…and ran into a stony brick wall of utter silence.Search as I might and certainly did over the years — and I read of Heim’s workover twelve years ago! — I simply could find nothing else out about the manother than that mentioned by Cramp in his book. I even began to doubt that he,or his theory, ever even existed.2. GETTING ACQUAINTED: THE DOCUMENTARYHowever, one day many years after reading of Heim in Cramp’s book, and quite bychance, I purchased an old used copy of a documentary on UFOs from a localbookstore that also specialized in used movies, videos, and unusualdocumentaries. The documentary was called Above Top Secret, Part Two.554[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-554] As I began watching thedocumentary it became clear that I was not watching the typical UFO featurette,full of wild-eyed hysteria about “coming disclosure” and unsubstantiated talesof abductions and gruesome medical experiments. Certainly the video containedsuch elements, but these were sandwiched between a series of otherwise verystaid interviews with some very unusual people. I would have written thedocumentary off as more nonsense, had it not been for the presence of one manwho made me pull up from my reclining and dozing slouch, and pay very closeattention.The man was Baron Jesco Von Puttkamer, a tall, distuinguished-lookingsilver-haired man in a well-tailored suit, calmly explaining in his heavy Germanaccent what NASA had to do in order to look beyond chemical rockets toward a newphysics and new technology. But that is not what caught my attention. Whatcaught my attention was the video’s description of him as simply an “advisor” toNASA and to Gene Roddenberry, creator of the famous Star Trek and Star Trek: TheNext Generation science fiction television series.But I knew what most viewers of the documentary probably did not know: Jesco VonPuttkamer was no ordinary German who just happened to work for NASA or as aconsultant for Gene Roddenberry. Jesco Von Puttkamer was none other than AdolfHitler’s personal Naval Adjutant to Staff, the Kriegsmarine’s representative tothe OberKommando der Werhmacht (O.K.W.) before and during the Second World War!There is even a picture of a very young Kapitän zur See555[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-555] Von Puttkamer standing withReichsmarschal Göring and Adolf Hitler, who is bent over a map, in the map roomof the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, planning the invasion of France in JohnToland’s celebrated biography of Hitler! Von Puttkamer began the war as aCaptain in the German navy, but by war’s end had been promoted to Admiral.556[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-556]What was Adolf Hitler’s personal naval adjutant to staff doing working forNASA!?!? But before the question had even been formulated in my mind, thedocumentary then cut away for another interlude of hysteria, before returning toanother elderly silver-haired German, talking quite slowly and with measureddeliberation, being interpreted by a commentator.That man — so the caption told me — was Burkhart Heim.As I sat and listened to Heim’s brief remarks, however, it became quite apparentthat the documentary’s producers either hadn’t the faintest clue of thesignificance of his theories, or that they did, and were deliberately going outof their way to avoid talking about them, for Heim himself was merely speakingout against nuclear energy and its environmental consequences and connections tothe military-industrial complex (of West Germany, of course)!The reason why I suspected a deliberate obfuscation of Heim’s theory was thepresence of Puttkamer himself, Hitler’s naval adjutant, for as I was also wellaware, the German Navy, beginning during the Weimar era and continuing into theThird Reich itself, had shown an interest in the development of alternativeenergy technologies such as the Coler Coil,557[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-557] and moreover, a Germanadmiral was somehow involved in the Bell project itself.558[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-558] Nor was the connection ofnaval services to such alternative technologies limited to Germany, for as Ialso pointed out in my previous book Secrets of the Unified Field: ThePhiladelphia Experiment, the Nazi Bell, and the Discarded Theory, the U.S. Navyhad taken such an interest as well, in the form of the Office of Naval Researchand its Project Orbiter-Vanguard committee, which included, among others, Dr.Wernher Von Braun as a possible recipient of the Varo Annotated Edition ofMorris Jessup’s The Case for the UFOs, a book outlining the PhiladelphiaExperiment!559 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-559]I concluded that the inclusion of Jesco Von Puttkamer, and Heim, and the neglectof any mention of the extraordinary implications of Heim’s theory, in thedocumentary was hardly an accident. It had been a deliberate attempt to point asubtle finger once more to Germany, to Nazi Germany, with the subtle message of“look closer, look here.”And that brings us to Heim’s extraordinary theory, and to the even greatermystery of what he was doing for the Nazis that cost him his arms, sight, andhearing.3. THE BASICS OF HEIM THEORYA. MOTIVATIONS OF THE THEORYUnusually, it was when Heim died in 2001 at the age of seventy-six that histheory first gained notoriety outside of Germany, most notably in the UnitedStates, in a series of papers presented at various technical conferences by hisassociates Walter Dröscher and Jochem Häuser, who had revised and extended histheory along the lines Heim himself was outlining at the time of his death.As was noted above, Heim himself, according to Leonard Cramp, began to work outthe details of his theory precisely in reference to solving the problem of apermanent human presence in deep space. Such a presence, Heim reasoned, couldonly be established by an entirely new paradigm of physics, with all of itsimplied revolutionary technologies. In their paper on Heim theory presented tothe 40th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit in July of2004 in Fort Lauderdale, Dröscher and Häuser mention this very problem inconnection with NASA’s “Breakthrough Propulsion Program”:For effective and efficient lunar space transportation as well as interplanetaryor even interstellar space flight a revolution in space propulsion technology isneeded.Regarding the requirements of NASA’s Breakthrough Propulsion Program (BPP) arevolutionary space propulsion system should• use no or a very limited amount of fuel,• possibility for superluminal speed, and• requirement for a low energy budget. This immediately rules out any deviceflying close to the speed of light, since its mass is going to infinity,according to (Special Relativity). A spacecraft having a mass of 105 kg, flyingat a speed of 1% of the speed of light, carries an energy content of 4.5x1017(joules). Even if the spacecraft can be provided with a 100 (megawatt) nuclearreactor, it would take some 143 years to produce this amount of energy.It is understood that the laws of current physics do not allow for such arevolutionary space propulsion system. Propulsion techniques of this type canonly emerge from novel physics, i.e., physical theories that deliver aunification of physics that are consistent and founded on basic, generallyaccepted principles, either removing some of the limit, or giving rise toadditional fundamental forces, and thus providing alternatives to currentpropulsion principles.560 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-560]Since Heim’s theory itself is only published and available in Germany — and froma very unusual source as we shall see — our examination of his theory will bevia its revised form as presented by his associates.In doing so, one must assume that their critiques of the contemporary state oftheoretical physics are reflections of those of Heim himself. Having stated theneed for a breakthrough physics and technology, Dröscher and Häuser point outsome of the fundamental difficulties of quantum mechanics and relativity dogma:(Quantum) theory… in its current form does not lead to an explanation of theelementary structures of matter, and does not lead to a consistent cosmologyeither….In (quantum theory) the existence of matter is taken for granted,defining an elementary particle as a point-like structure. In classical physics,including the General Theory of Relativity…, science starts from the belief thatspace and time are infinitely divisible, in other words, that spacetime iscontinuous (a differentiable manifold in the mathematical sense). Both ideascontradict Nature’s all-pervading quantization principle and immediately lead tocontradictions in the form of infinite self-energies or self-accelerations.561[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-561]Moreover, the general problems of the contemporary standard models go muchfurther, and lead to (intentional?) dead ends:…(Quantum theory) has not been able to deliver the mass spectrum of elementaryparticles, nor is there a theoretical explanation for their lifetimes, neithercan quantum numbers be derived. None of these theories is able to explain thenature of matter and inertia, topics that are essential for the physics of acompletely novel propulsion system.562[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-562]This leads to the first and most fundamental principle of Heim Theory:B. THE GEOMETRIZATION AND QUANTIZATION OF SPACE-TIME ITSELFDröscher and Häuser point out that Heim did not reject one fundamental insightof Einstein, both in his General Theory of Relativity and more importantly, inhis subsequent versions of the Unified Field Theory, namely, that physicalforces could be described geometrically. Thus, forces not only were functions ofthe geometry, the geometry was the forces. But there is one crucial insight toHeim’s version of the theory, borrowed from the standard model of quantummechanics, and that is “the two important ingredients that Einstein did notuse,” namely “a discrete spacetime and a higher dimensional space, provided withspecial, additional features.”563[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-563] Thus, Heim’s theory is alogical extension of the insight of quantum mechanics and the various UnifiedField Theories of the 1920s and 1930s in that all physical interactions aredescribed as geometries, and in the crucial insight that space-time itself isquantized, that is, that it is built not of ever smaller infinitely divisibleunits, but of discrete “smallest possible” units of space and time.564[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-564]Thus, Heim’s theory is not only a “completely geometrized unified field theory”but it is one with profound implications, for it gives rise “to a novel conceptfor an advanced space transportation technology, permitting, in principle,superluminal travel.”565 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-565]This unification is accomplished, in its extended version, by aneight-dimensional quantized “and spin-oriented space.”566[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-566] As a result, its predictivepower is enormous, for it not only predicts fundamental particle properties suchas masses and lifetimes,567 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-567]but also that “a transformation of electromagnetic wave energy at specificfrequencies into gravitational like energy is possible.”568[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-568]In coming to this view, Heim followed the principle of General Relativity anduniversalized it. In General Relativity, matter bends space-time itself, or, toput it differently, matter is a “bend” in the fabric of space-time; “matter andspacetime curvature are equal.”569[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-569] Since the geometry andmatter itself are equivalent, and to that extent, since matter is caused by thegeometry of space-time distortion, then the essence of Heim’s Theory is thatevery physical interaction or fields including gravity, electromagnetism, andthe strong and weak forces of quantum mechanics are distortions in whatotherwise would be a non-distorted undifferentiable space-time. Heim firstpresented this view “in 1952 at the International Congress on Aeronautics inStuttgart, Germany,”570 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-570] adate rather close to the end of World War II, and not without its own suggestiveimplications, as will be seen. Heim further formally developed these ideas inthe first versions of his theory during the late 1950s and early 1960s, theprecise period in which Leonard Cramp’s book appeared, outlining his views forthe first time to an English-speaking general public.C. SPIN-ORIENTATION POTENTIAL OF THE LATTICE STRUCTURE OF SPACE-TIMEThis insight leads in turn to the next fundamental component of the extendedeight- and twelve-dimensional versions of his theory. Dröscher and Häuserpresent this aspect of his theory in the following manner:According to Heim, the whole universe comprises a grid of Metrons or metroniclattice. Space that does not contain any information consists of a discreteEuclidean grid….However, empty space must be isotropic with regard to spinorientation. If all metronic spins of a 6D volume pointed outward or inward,such a world would not have a spin potentiality. Therefore, cells with all spinsoutward have to have neighboring cells with all spins inward and vice versa.This alternative spin structure satisfies the isotropy requirement, but providesempty space with spin potentiality…. Thus empty space is void of physicalevents, but has inherent potentiality for physical events to happen.571[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-571]In other words, the normal void of space itself, absent any informationdistortions such as mass or matter, is a pure potential for “things to happen,”it is the transmutative medium of the ancients. As a void it is anon-differentiated nothing, since there is a balance of spin orientations in allits cells.It is thus when that balance or equilibrium is unbalanced and enters intonon-equilibrium, where a preponderance of spin orientation of one or the othertype prevails, that all physical interaction, and all matter, arises.Non-equilibrium and spin are the very mechanisms not only for thedifferentiations of creation, but therefore are also the very mechanisms of theunification of physics, or, to put it in alchemical terms, for the “em-bodiment”of the medium itself within normal matter. Thus, Heim’s theory incorporates andcorroborates the fundamental insights of Jordan and Kozyrev, for particlesthemselves for they are “geometrical entities that possess an internal structurewhich is changing cyclically in time…Elementary particles are not pointentities, but do consist of Metrons.”572[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-572] Thus, in a sense peculiarlyparalleling some ancient views, “space and time are not the container forthings, but are, due to their dynamic (cyclic) nature, the thingsthemselves.”573 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-573] In Heim’shands, this dynamic view leads to a truly extraordinary cosmology, because thehigher dimensional space is composed of such a lattice of “metrons” there are no“singularities” or infinities that plague the standard models, and that have tobe gotten rid of by the fancy mathematical accounting trick ofrenormalization.574 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-574] Theuniverse thus began as a single metron covering its entire surface (theundifferentiated medium), and as the number of metrons increased, their sizedecreased.575 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-575]In short, the spin-orientation and active force characteristics of time itselfis the fundamental pillar of Heim’s theory.If all this is beginning to sound familiar, hold on, there’s more.In the twelve-dimensional extension of Heim’s original theory, there arefive semantic units, namely, the subspaces R3 (space), T1(time), S2(organization), I2 (information) and G4 (steering of I2) where superscriptsdenote dimension. Except for the 3 spatial dimensions, all other coordinates areimaginary. Several metric tensors can be constructed from these subspaces….Analyzing the metric tensors acting in R4, the theory predicts six fundamentalinteractions, instead of the four experimentally known ones.576[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-576]These two additional interactions are the basis behind the claim that the theoryholds out the promise of a breakthrough in physics and in propulsion and energytechnologies.The first of these reactions, a weak gravitationally repulsive action, which isanalogous to the standard model’s “dark energy,” Heim calls by the peculiar term“quintessence,” a term with its own alchemical associations, as has been seen,and thus perhaps suggestive of influences at work on Heim’s thinking other thanthe purely physics-related, namely, the alchemical. But there is also a“gravitophoton” reaction that “enables the conversion of electromagneticradiation into a gravitational like field.”577[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-577]It will have been noted by the careful reader that Heim’s hyper-dimensionalspace is actually comprised of five sub-spaces, one of which is our normalthree-dimensional space. Put differently, our three-dimensional space isinfluenced by distortions in the higher nine-dimensional space composed of itssub-spaces, recalling esotericist Manly P. Hall’s observation that thesuccessful confection of the Philosophers’ Stone must be realized by oneoperation occurring simultaneously in four separate worlds.It is precisely Heim theory’s prediction of a directgravitational-electromagnetic coupling that Dröscher and Häuser propose as thebasis “for the novel space propulsion concept” that will be presentedmomentarily.578 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-578]D. THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY’S AND THE U.S. AIR FORCE’S ANTI-GRAVITY EXPERIMENT,VERSUS HEIM THEORYTaking as their point of departure a series of experiments sponsored jointly bythe European Space Agency and the U.S. Air Force, Dröscher and Häuser summarizethe experiments and its implications as follows:In a recent experiment (March 2006), funded by the European Space Agency and theAir Force Office of Scientific Research, Taimer et al. report on the generationof a toroidal (tangential, azimuthal) gravitational field in a rotatingaccelerated (time dependent angular velocity) superconducting Niobium ring. INJuly 2006, in a presentation at Berkeley university [sic], Taimar showedimproved experimental results that confirmed previous experimental findings.Very recently, October 2006 and February 2007 the same authors reportedrepeating their experiments employing both accelerometers as well as laserring-gyros that very accurately measured the gravito-magnetic field. Theacceleration field was clearly observed, and its rotational nature wasdetermined by a set of four accelerometers in the plane of the ring.Since the experiment generates an artificial gravitational field, which is inthe plane of the rotating ring…it cannot be used as a propulsion principle. Itis, however, of great importance, since it shows for the first time that agravitational field can be generated other than by the accumulation of mass.579[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-579]Again, the mention of superconductors recalls Hudson’s observations of mass lossanomalies in his strange material, and of physicist Hal Puthoff’s explanationsfor them.But note what Dröscher and Häuser conclude about the configuration of theexperiment: since the artificial gravitational field was generated in the planeof the rotation of the superconductor, and not in the plane parallel to the axisof rotation, no practical propulsive benefit could accrue from the experiment.And this, precisely, is where Heim’s unique theory steps in:…(Theoretical) considerations obtained from (Extended Heim Theory) lead to theconclusion that an experiment should be possible to generate a gravitationalfield acting parallel to the axis of rotation of (a) rotating ring... and thus,if confirmed, could serve as a demonstrator for a field propulsion principle.580[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-580]The authors then propose an apparatus for testing this hypothesis consisting oftwo counter-rotating systems arranged, as per the predictions of Heim’s theory,one on top of the other, exactly as I have conjectured was the actual internalconfiguration of the Nazi Bell’s counter-rotating drums! 581[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-581]040 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_040_r1.gif]Dröscher and Häuser’s Proposed Apparatus for the Testing of a Field PropulsionPrinciple in a Plane Parallel to the Axis of Two Stacked Counter-rotatingSystemsThat this theory would predict so specifically such effects, within such a shorttime after the end of World War II, with its suspicious resemblance to theactual proposed configuration of the Bell’s internal counter-rotating drums, issuggestive that there is perhaps more in play in the formation of Heim’s theorythan meets the eye. And this is only confirmed by the mystery of what sort ofresearch Heim was actually engaged in during the war.B. THE MYSTERY OF HEIM’S WORLD WAR II RESEARCHAs mentioned, Heim performed most of his theoretical work entirely in his head,having lost his hands, sight, and hearing in a wartime accident doing vague andnever-specified research for the Nazis during the war. Try as one might, onesimply cannot find any material or indications on what Heim might have beendoing, so one is thrown back upon threadbare clues and a process of reasonedextrapolation and speculation from them.1. THE ACCIDENTAll that is known about the accident that left Heim handicapped for life wasthat sometime ca. 1942–1943, Heim was drafted to do service in the Luftwaffe. Atsome point during this period he sent a letter to “the Chemical-TechnicalReichsanstalt in Berlin, whereupon he was summoned to work there on thedevelopment of the proposed new explosives. It was here that he met with theaccident...”582 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-582] But whattype of explosives might this have been that so caught the eye of the Luftwaffe?2. HEIM AND HEISENBERG ON A “CLEAN” HYDROGEN BOMB: BALLOTECHNIC EXPLOSIVE WORK?A clue, perhaps, is afforded by the fact that sometime during 1943, apparentlyin the same time frame as this research, Heim actually met the famous founder ofquantum mechanics, Werner Heisenberg. Heim informed Heisenberg “of his plan touse chemical implosion to facilitate an atomic explosion. This design was basedon his idea he developed for a clean hydrogen bomb when he was 18.”583[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-583] But as has been seen in ourexamination of the Soviet “Mercury” and the whole “Red Mercury Legend,” the ideaof a clean hydrogen bomb, one not reliant upon the far dirtier atom bomb as thefuse, required precisely a breakthrough in conventional explosives technologies:the so-called ballotechnic explosive. And as was seen, one proposal for such anexplosive was precisely the high-spin state of certain isotopes known asisomers, which, if induced to “suddenly stop” spinning, would release the energyof their angular momentum in a massive flash of electromagnetic energy in theform of high-frequency gamma rays which, if properly configured in an implosiondetonator, might obtain sufficient energies to initiate nuclear fusion, andunleash the far greater destructive potentials of the hydrogen bomb. Given theprominent and pivotal role of spin orientation in Heim’s subsequent theory, itseems that one must hold out the possibility, highly speculative though it be,that Heim may have been engaged in such research for the Nazis. And if hisaccident is any indicator, that research may have met with some measure ofsuccess. And there is one final factor to recall in this respect, and that isthat Heisenberg, according to the latest research of Igor Witkowski, headedprecisely some group engaged in nuclear research at the University of Dresden!Might Heim’s contact with Heisenberg and his comments about a clean H-bomb infact be related to the otherwise unknown purposes of that research?It seems a possibility that one must entertain.And if Heim’s theory makes such specific predictions as to the nature of thegravity-electromagnetic coupling effect that an experiment can be formulated onits basis using stacked counter-rotating systems, then the connections to theBell and its mysterious Serum 525 — a compound that I have suggested may haveemployed high-spin-state thorium isomers — are even more stunning. It isbeginning to look as if Heim may possibly have been involved in some very secretresearch for the Nazis, and that his subsequent postwar theory, which so closelyapproximates the details of the scientific rationalizations I have advanced forthe Bell project, may have been precisely an attempt to work out in greaterdetail the results of that project!3. HIS CURIOUSLY ALCHEMICAL REFERENCE: QUINTESSENCE, AND HIS PUBLICATION OF HISTHEORY WITH A NEW AGE PUBLISHERA further mystery that surrounds Heim is his persistent mystical nature. As hasbeen pointed out, Heim himself called his fifth physical interaction the“quintessence” force, a term with specifically alchemical roots. As if to hintat this influence, Heim curiously chose to publish two highly mathematical andtechnical books, in German, outlining his theory, not with any scientificpublishing house, but with a New Age publisher! Given what we have learned aboutthe alchemical influences of Wiligut at work in the SS, and its closeresemblances to the actual parameters of the Bell project, once again theconceptual link to Heim’s subsequent formalized theory is curious, and addsfurther weight to the speculation that he may have had some connection to theproject.4. PASCUAL JORDAN AND WERNHER VON BRAUNAs if to make the strange connection of Burkhart Heim to Nazi secret researcheven more compelling, shortly after word of the nature of the firstsix-dimensional version of his theory circulated throughout Germany, Heim wasvisited by both Wernher Von Braun and none other than Pascual Jordan, whose owntheories shared many similarities with Heim’s. Both men praised his work ascontaining breathtaking implications!584[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-584]So what does one have with the quiet German physicist, Burkhart Heim, a man whodeliberately avoided learning English so that his astonishing theory would neverbe circulated outside of Germany?585[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-585] One has, at the minimum, abrilliantly penetrating intellect with a possibly dubious past working for theNazis in some very sensitive projects, a past that he perhaps deliberately triedto atone for with his sincerely-felt postwar advocacy for peace and for forms ofenergy production that were not based on nuclear power or non-renewableresources.In this theory, a fully geometrized and quantized space and time were for Heimthe very nature of the transmutative physical medium itself.Space is, in some sense, the Philosophers’ Stone, for in order for there to be agenuine human presence in deep space, it will require, as Heim — and the Nazisbefore him — saw, a breakthrough in physics, a breakthrough dependent upon theability to embody the transmutative medium in the matter of human technology, anembodiment that will, in some sense and for good or ill, “alchemicallytransform” mankind himself. And that, in turn, might in fact require theconfection of some new Serum 525, to be utilized in some new Bell.Or, to put it differently, the old Serum and the old Bell have simply continuedto be worked upon, somewhere, in utmost secrecy, and brought to a perfectiononly hinted at in the original Nazi experiments."},{"pageContent":"14EPILOGUE IS PROLOGUE THE HOLY GRAIL OF PHYSICS AND ALCHEMY041 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_041_r1.jpg]“First and foremost, Otto Rahn was a modern-day alchemist…”Nigel Graddon586 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-586] With Heim’s hyper-dimensional theory, complete with its spin-oriented space, itsview of space as a lattice of information, as a “crystal” whose defects mirror,and indeed are the physical forces, we have come full circle, and ended where webegan: on the plateau of Giza, gazing up at the massive crystal of the greatestalchemical, hyper-dimensional machine of mankind, the Great Pyramid. We endwhere we began, with the view of space and of the physical medium itself as atransmutative medium whose differentiations — giving rise to the universe —arose from a “primary differentiation,” from an ultimate asymmetry andnon-equilibrium, from the physics of a “primal twist” (to employ Wiligut’ssuggestive phrase) whose ideogram is the swastika. If there is one thing thatunites the three alchemical quests for the “triune Philosophers’ Stone” examinedin the previous pages — the American “Gold,” the Soviet “Mercury,” and the Nazi“Serum” — it is rotation, spin, torsion.This latter point may best be illustrated by once again appealing to thealchemical version of the Trinitarian shield of the Augustinian formulation ofthe doctrine of the Trinity, a formulation that, it was suggested back in partone, was actually nothing more than a formulation of physics in the guise of ametaphysical and religious doctrine. If one places the “Philosophers’ Stone” ofthe concepts of “spin and torsion” in the center circle, and each of the threeexotic substances we have examined — the American “Gold,” the Soviet “Mercury,”and the Nazi “Serum” in each of the three vertices of the shield, one sees thelink:042 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_042_r1.gif]The Triune Stone: Spin and Torsion as the Unifying ConceptThe truly paradoxical thing about this journey has not been its alchemicalnature, however, but that so much not only appears to have been known (or atleast, preserved) both by the alchemists, but known or at least rediscovered bythe Soviets and the Nazis. With Hudson, we encountered a paradoxical, thoughlargely accidental — and for that reason all the more compelling — rediscoveryof the Stone, and by processes indeed very similar to those within the tenuoustechnological grasp of the alchemists. With Kozyrev and the Soviets, theprinciple of rotating open systems, of ever-changing torsion and time, confirmedyet another alchemical insight: that timing was everything to the performance ofa successful alchemical confection of the Stone. With Kozyrev, accidentaldiscovery had been abandoned for real science, for real testability, and forreal engineering of the forces of time. One senses with the Soviets a closelyrationalized development. Perhaps in the end the Red Mercury legend is really atestament to the explosive success of their research.But it is with the Nazis that we find all the threads fully rationalized: theactual esoteric and occulted influence of alchemy in the SS via Wiligut, theprofound understanding of the swastika as an ideogram of that “primal twist,”the alchemical nature of space-time itself, the blend of accidental discoveryand a well-conceived program to recover that science of the control ofspacetime. All the threads led to, and came together in, the Nazi Reich, theBell and Serum 525, and again afterward in its Project Paperclip survival insidethe USA in the form of some of the personnel — Debus and possibly Strughold —who worked on it.The story, however, does not end there.In chapter eleven, “The Greater German Alchemical Reich,” the connection betweenReichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler and SS archaeologist and esoteric scholar OttoRahn via “Himmler’s Rasputin,” Karl Maria Wiligut, was mentioned. But there ismore to Rahn than being merely some sort of Nazi “Indiana Jones” or Himmler’sfavorite SS esotericist, for the modern apocryphal rumors surrounding him arealmost as strange as the man himself.A. OTTO RAHN, THE GRAIL, AND THE LANGUEDOCOtto Rahn’s claim to fame rests on a very few seminal works on alchemy and thequest for the Holy Grail. Indeed, it was Otto Rahn, on the basis of hisscholarly exposition of the whole legend as first embodied in Wolfram VonEschenbach’s mediaeval Grail epic Parzifal, who first suggested that thecharacters and place names in the epic could be traced to specific individualsand places in the strange province of southern France known as the Languedoc.Rahn, following Eschebach rather closely, was not of the view that the Grailconstituted so much the lost cup of Christ, but rather, a lost stone or tabletof knowledge. Eschenbach described it in rather vivid terms:Guyot, the master of high renownFound, in confused pagan writing,The legend which reaches back to the prime source of (all) legends…On an emerald green achmardiShe bore the perfection of Paradise.It was the object called the Grail.587[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-587]The reference to an emerald-green achmardi recalls the esoteric and alchemicaltradition that Thoth, the Egyptian wisdom god the Greeks would later call HermesTrismegistus, inscribed all his lore and science on an Emerald Green tablet. Italso recalls similar tales from Sumerian mythology regarding the lost Tablets ofDestinies, over which many wars of the gods were fought.In short, Rahn was decoding the alchemical tradition, and this, as has beenseen, was a primary concern to the upper and innermost circles of Himmler’s SS.For Rahn, the Grail was not a lost cup, but a lost stone:The etymology of the word Grail was said by French mystic-philosopher RenéGuénon to derive from: Grail = Gor = precious stone and Al = stylus, combinedgiving precious engraved stone. This Grail reveals the Book of the Key or thefinal secret. The stones were engraved by a race of pre-Flood, Ayran superman,residents of Hyperborea (Thule, White Island)….588[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-588]It was not, therefore, hidden treasure or the lost cup of Christ that the Nazis,through Rahn, were searching for in the Languedoc of southern France, but lostknowledge, lost science, and lost technology. Indeed, during Rahn’s trip therehe wrote a letter in September 1935 directly to Wiligut, “telling him excitedlyof a place he was visiting in his search for the Grail and asking for completesecrecy except for Himmler.”589[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-589]Indeed, as Rahn researcher Nigel Graddon points out, it is this lost knowledge,this lost antediluvian stone tablet, and its possible location in the Languedocthat might have formed a completely hidden and occulted agenda behind both thegenocidal Albigensian crusade in the region launched by the papacy and the kingof France, and the later massacre of French peasants in the village of Ouradourby the Waffen SS in the same region centuries later in 1944.1. THE GRAIL, THE STONE, THE FLEECE, AND THE COSMIC WARRahn, moreover, like alchemists before him, believed on the basis of hisresearch that the Golden Fleece of mythological fame was one and the same thingas the Philosophers’ Stone.590[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-590] But there was a furtherconnection that Rahn had made:Raoul Lefèvre wrote his Histoire de Jason in 1456 in which the remarkablefeature is the inclusion of both the Golden Fleece and the parchment of theEmerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus. A king called Apollo received a parchmentfrom the god Mars containing “all the mysteries that should be preserved toachieve such a lofty thing.” The lofty thing is the Fleece.591[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-591]The reference to the planet Mars, ancient god of war across so many ancienthuman cultures, makes the connection between the Philosophers’ Stone,Thoth’s-Hermes’ Emerald Tablet, the ancient Sumerian Tablets of Destinies — aconnection first mentioned in part one of this book — and the suggestive themeof Mars and a Cosmic War. The connection is disturbing, for if this was apparentto Rahn — and there is no direct evidence that it was — then it would mean thathis presence and the Nazis’ interest in the Languedoc was to find and militarilyexploit this lost knowledge.They were trying to recover it.2. THE FIRST RUMOR: THE VRIL SOCIETY AND THE TIME PROJECTYet another rumor associated with Rahn, or rather, with his SS masters, was thatthe SS, as far back as its pre-Nazi forebears in the Vril Society, wasattempting to construct the technologies of time travel.592[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-592] While there has as yet beenno real evidence for this beyond a much-repeated telling of the story, Graddondoes mention that the Nazi interest in Tibet may have some connection to thisstory, and that “the time-technology work of Dr. Karl Obermayer, Nikola Tesla,and Rudolf Steiner” on behalf of a so-called “Prometheus Foundation” wassupposedly “carried out allegedly to thwart the worst excesses of Hitler’s trueagenda,” an agenda he strongly implies was that of controlling time.593[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-593]3. THE SECOND RUMOR: OF SUPERCONDUCTORSA second rumor connecting Rahn to these mysterious goings-on in connection withtime-control technology is that there are rumors to the effect that some objectwith superconductive properties was smuggled out of Germany to the U.S.A.sometime in 1938.594 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-594] Ifindeed Rahn was closely associated to Himmler’s Rasputin, Wiligut, as his letterto him suggests, then it is just possible that Rahn had figured out this aspectof the lost science and wisdom he found in his studies of esoteric texts.4. PROTO-STAR-CLOUDS AND MICRO-DIAMONDSIn a final tantalizing bit of information, Rahn researcher Nigel Graddon alsomentions the legend of Asteria, “who hung millions of crystals by silver threadsinside the heavenly dome and called hem her stars.”595[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-595] He also cites a passage inverse from a section of the Vedas called Indra’s Net:There is an endless net of threadsThroughout the universe.The horizontal threads are in space.The vertical threads are in time.At every crossing of the threads,There is an individual.And every individual is a crystal bead.The great light of absolute beingIlluminates and penetratesEvery crystal bead, and also,Every crystal bead reflectsNot only the lightFrom every other crystal in the net,But also every reflectionOf every reflectionThroughout the Universe.596 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-596]As was already seen in part one, it is part of the lore both of astrology and ofalchemy that every star and planet has its own unique association with aspecific type of gemstone, or crystal. And as was also seen, in Heim’s theoryspace-time is not only a latticework of spin-oriented cells, but the veryphysical phenomena of objects and forces are themselves distortions and defectsin that “crystalline” latticework.Graddon then points out a peculiar recent discovery:In 1992 the annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference held in Houston,Texas, reported that an analysis of studies carried out at the InfraredTelescope Facility at Mauna Kea in Hawaii indicated that molecular cloudscontain a most unusual carbon atom bonded to a hydrogen atom and to three othercarbon atoms. Further analysis showed that these blobs of gas and dust, whicheventually give birth to stars, are full of floating micro-diamonds. Is it justaccident that ancient peoples believed that the twinkling stars in the heavenswere crystals, or did they have information from a time long lost in the distantpast?597 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-597]Given what we now know of Wiligut, Rahn, and the whole mission brief of the SSAhnenerbedienst, one would have to speculate that the Nazis had already answeredthat question in favor of the passing down of information from a remote past.B. WORLD WAR II: AN ALCHEMICAL WAR TO CONTROL THE TECHNOLOGY OF TIME?In a final piece of tantalizing information, Nigel Graddon states thatWriter Elizabeth Van Buren regards (World War II) as a colossal attempt by thedarkside [sic] of humanity to harness the secrets of Time. Similarly, MauriceMagré believed that the swastika symbolized the power of Time. Thor’s hammer,Mjolnir, is associated with the alchemical characteristics of the swastika,symbolizing the transmutation and origins of matter.598[../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-598]But if World War II was, in some sense, a war to create and control thetechnology of the manipulations of space-time, then in that sense, it was analchemical war.Close scrutiny and consideration of this radical and highly speculativeproposition will reveal its profundity, for Nazi Germany had to free itself fromthe alchemically-based financial system of the West imposed on Weimar Germany inthe Treaty of Versailles. It had, in short, not only to find but to fund thephysics in order to break free of the dynastic cartels of international financecapital and the few supremely private and wealthy hands that controlled it.Modern fiat money and reserve banking is indeed a manifestation of thetransmutative “nothingness” of the Philosophers’ Stone, for from the creation ofcredit out of nothing, gold is produced. By nationalizing that institution andwresting it from private, secretive hands, and using it to fund the alchemicalphysics it was beginning to develop as the ultimate energy source, as theultimate power to transport mankind, and as the ultimate power for destructionon a doomsday scale, the Nazis indicated that they had understood the nature ofthe Stone. They had seen, and fully understood, the connection betweenalchemical physics, and alchemical finance. And they were willing to put it tosupremely evil uses.But that connection between alchemical physics and alchemical finance is,perhaps, a relationship that requires its own exposition….Epilogue is Prologue…."},{"pageContent":"043 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_043_r1.jpg]BIBLIOGRAPHY044 [../Images/jose_9781932595611_oeb_044_r1.jpg](No Author) (Intelligence intercept) Inter 12 Dec 44 (1.2) Japanese; rec’d 12Dec 44; Trans Dec 44 (3020-B).

Yet the truth is that NASA was born in a lie, andhas concealed the truths of its occult origins and its sensational discoverieson the Moon and Mars. Dark Mission documents these seemingly wild assertions.Few people are aware that NASA was formed as a national defense agency adjunctempowered to keep information classified and secret from the public at large.Even fewer people are aware of the hard evidence that secret brotherhoodsquietly dominate NASA, with policies far more aligned with ancient religious andoccult mystery schools than the façade of rational science the government agencyhas successfully promoted to the world for almost fifty years.Why is the US government intent on returning to the Moon as quickly as possible?What are the reasons for the current “space race” with China, Russia, evenIndia? Remarkable images reproduced within this book provided to the authors bydisaffected NASA employees give clues why, including spectacular informationabout lunar and Martian discoveries.Former NASA consultant and CBS News advisor Richard C. Hoagland and Boeingengineer Mike Bara offer extraordinary information regarding the secret historyof the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the astonishingdiscoveries it has suppressed for decades. Co-author Mike Bara is an engineerwho has worked for Boeing and other aeronautic firms.The Freemasonic flag seen on the cover was brought to the Moon by 32° astronautBuzz Aldrin, and later ceremoniously presented to Scottish Rite headquarters inWashington D.C."},{"pageContent":"1 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c01_r1.html#Ref-FTN-1]Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach, „Die Verwandlung von Quecksilber in Gold” (“TheTransmutation of Mercury into Gold”), Frankfurter Zeitung, Freitag, 18, Juli1924 (Friday, July 18, 1924), cited in my SS Brotherhood of the Bell, p. 273.The full English translation is given on pp. 272–273, with the German originalof the newspaper article reproduced on p. 274.2 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c01_r1.html#Ref-FTN-2]Even such a well-known alchemist and the man that many regard as also laying thefoundations for modern science, Sir Francis Bacon, Lord Verullam, complains ofthe practice of alchemy being “full of Error and Imposture,” On the Making ofGold, from Century IV of Sylva Sylvarum, or a Naturall Historie in ten Centures,London, 1627.

It wasthe famous British physicist, the brilliant E.T. Whittaker, whose paper “On thepartial differential equations of mathematical physics,” analyzed themathematical scalar potential into pairs of bi-directional longitudinal waves ofstress and rarefaction in the medium itself, moving superluminally. In otherwords, the normal dimensionless “scalar potential” became an entity possessed ofa discrete and quantized structure; quite an accomplishment, especiallyconsidering that his paper was published before Special Relativity (in 1903 ascompared to Einstein’s paper of 1905), and this some three decades beforequantum mechanical theory began to be fully fleshed out. This remarkable paperis rendered even more remarkable by the fact that Whittaker clearly implies thatthe physical substrate or aether not only has dynamic structure of stress andrarefaction, but that he clearly implies that it is a kind of sub-space ofnormal space, or, alternatively, that it is a kind of “hyper-dimensional” spacelying “inside of,” or “behind,” or “above” normal space. These “hyper-spaces,”moreover, Whittaker clearly implies to exist in a kind of harmonic series, i.e.,their defining characteristics are in terms of frequency resonance. Again, aswill be seen in part three, similar conceptions lie behind a breathtakingphysical theory now gaining some quiet attention in the corridors of engineeringand applied science institutions and agencies.205 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c04_r1.html#Ref-FTN-205]Hudson’s sources are cited at www.asc-alchemy.com/hudson.html[http://www.asc-alchemy.com/hudson.html], pp. 55–59.206 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c04_r1.html#Ref-FTN-206]A.O.

Hence, if thiswas the ultimate rationalization of the invasion, the Allies would have beenmore likely to invade further north than they did.In support of the idea of some sort of Italian atomic research, however, is thepeculiar and curious fact that Fascist Italy had begun to modify several of itsfour-engine long-range bombers for possible eventual use on the USA in one-wayatom bomb suicide attacks.

That the German Empire was the crowning achievement ofPrussian statecraft and generalship cannot be gainsaid, but little is known ofthe possible role that the “Society of Lizards” and other lineal descendants ofthe Teutonic Knights may have played in this, beyond their obvious connection tothe Von Hohenzollerns themselves.

The presence of Wiligut’s ideas in the SS, and the fact that he is a closepersonal advisor to Himmler, the fact that his ideas at least conceptually bearsuch a strong resemblance to the actual operative parameters of the Bell, andfinally the fact that he himself states that some experimentation was alreadyunderway in separating these rotating fields is yet another argument in favor ofmy contention that the actual modern historical investigations and applicationsof this physics began in Nazi Germany.450 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c11_r1.html#Ref-FTN-450]Karl Maria Wiligut, a.k.a.

The reference to the code name “Gate” has led many tocontact me concerning the possibilities that the intention of the project wasreally to open a kind of “hyper-dimensional gateway” to contact“extra-dimensional intelligences,” and other extreme forms of speculation. Whilethe physics implied in the Bell certainly indicates that one of its directproject goals was precisely the manipulation of the fabric of space-time, suchextreme speculations cannot be supported from the evidence. At best, they remainjust that: extreme speculations. That said, there is another more mundane, butequally far-reaching series of implications. If indeed the Bell was conceived assome kind of “hyper-dimensional gate” to allow energy to pour down into ourlower-dimensional world, that would certainly fit in with the stated aims of theF.E.P. to render Germany energy-independent. Such a technology and physics alsoinevitably implies a weaponization potential far beyond that of mere nuclear andthermonuclear bombs. Hence, such an interpretation provides a basis for why theNazis would have classified the project as “War Decisive,” and why some sourcesmaintain that the Nazis were indeed working in areas of “doomsday physics.” (SeeSS Brotherhood of the Bell, pp. 192–241).510 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-510]See the summary of his interpretations and extrapolations in my SS Brotherhoodof the Bell, pp. 179–185.511 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-511]See my Secrets of the Unified Field, pp. 262–288.512 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-512]Geoffrey Brooks, Hitler’s Terror Weapons: From V1 to Vimana (2002), pp. 26–27,citing OSS Interrogation Archive document #12678 Nazi Occult Organizations.513 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-513]Brooks, Hitler’s Terror Weapons, p. 27, emphasis added.514 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-514]Ibid., emphasis added.515 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-515]Brooks, Hitler’s Terror Weapons, p. 27.516 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-516]Ibid., p. 28.517 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-517]Brooks, Hitler’s Terror Weapons, p. 28, emphasis added.518 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-518]Witkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p, 250519 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-519]Witkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 251.

Seealso my discussion in Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 228–231.The principle being utilized is this the creation of three electrical chargedifferentials between 1) the two counter-rotating drums themselves relative toeach other in the vertical axis of rotation, as between positive and negativecharge, producing a horizontal “neutral zone,” and 2) between the twocounterrotating drums as one system, and the central stationary core, as anothersystem. If this rationalization be true, then it is the closest anyone has cometo conceiving of an electrical “tri-pole,” and is an indicator that the Naziswere rationalizing their “electro-gravity” to an extraordinary degree.522 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-522]See my Secrets of the Unified Field, pp. 45–85.523 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-523]Varo Annotated Edition of Jessup’s The Case for the UFOs, cited in Secrets ofthe Unified Field, pp. 281–282, cited here without the annotators’ peculiarcapitalizations, italicizations, underlinings, and other emphases.524 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-524]Farrell, op. cit., p. 282.525 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-525]Ibid., p. 71.526 [../Text/jose_9781932595611_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-FTN-526]John J.
