IF SO , where is it located? Who areits members? What has it been up to? Ever since writing The Nazi International,people have been asking me these questions. Indeed, I have been asking themmyself, and in other books—Covert Wars and Breakaway Civilizations and CovertWars and the Clash of Civilizations —I have been attempting to lay thegroundwork necessary to answer that question. This book now attempts to do sodirectly. In point of fact, some of the material presented in this book I hadgathered years ago when researching and writing The Nazi International, but Ihad decided not to incorporate it in that book, because that book was, as itstitle suggests, focused on the international extent of postwar Nazism and someof its activities.But the answer to those questions is both disconcerting, and disconcertinglysimple, for the answer is immediately implicated in any consideration of theAugust 1944 meeting of German industrialists and Nazi Party leaders at the HotelMaison Rouge in Strasbourg, France. There the Nazi leadership and the Germanindustrialists agreed to create a worldwide system of front companies, and asystem of corporate-Nazi Party liaisons to maintain a covert coordination ofParty and corporate interests and goals for postwar Germany and Europe. Carefulconsideration of the implications of the Hotel Maison Rouge meeting indicatethat the principal field and center of action for the postwar extraterritorialstate that I have called the Nazi International remained centered in Europe, andwas concentrated into the centers of German corporate power. The NaziInternational is a thus constellation of corporate relationships bestcharacterized as cartels and trusts, behind which lurks an unreconstructed andunreformed Fascist ideology of the fusion of corporate and state power.It is that fusion of corporate and state power that was really at the root ofthe Morgenthau Plan, brainchild of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’sSecretary of the Treasury during World War Two, Henry Morgenthau Jr. For aperiod of a brief few months during the final stages of the war, the “MorgenthauPlan” became the official Allied policy for postwar Germany. Under the plan, theReich was not merely to be occupied by the Allied Powers, but broken up intothree or more independent states, and completely de-industrialized. There was acertain ineluctable logic to the idea, for only by the complete destruction ofthe massive German industrial plant could the power of the large Germancorporations and their hold and influence over the German state be broken.Morgenthau’s Plan, while little more than a memorandum for revenge, did haveanother rationale, and that was that American experts were fully aware of whatGermany’s war aims in both World Wars was: the creation of a pan-Europeanfederation under German dominance and leadership, and therefore, under thedominance of the industrial-capitalists of the Rhine. It is the consistency ofthose aims, and the patterns and techniques used to pursue (and, it should benoted, ultimately achieve) them, that is the subject of this book, for asalways, the devil is in the details.The Morgenthau Plan was, however, dead almost as soon as the ink was dry on thesurrender instruments signed at the end of World War Two by the German military,and for a very important reason: as will be seen in the main text, the Nazis hadmade it one of their chief aims and goals to liaise and utilize the pro-Germansympathies of the American financial and corporate elite, a power structure inwhich they recognized their own Fascist ideology. The objective was to steer acareful course, a “middle” or “third way” between the Western and Communistblocs until such time as a “European Reich” could be created of sufficienteconomic power and military potential to be a counterbalancing force between thetwo blocs, and until such time as the “rollback” of the Communist bloc could beachieved. This “third way” was to be, as we shall see, neither the financecapitalism of the West, nor the state socialism of the East, but thefinance-cartel capitalism and state socialism that became the hallmark ofImperial Germany, and remained as a fundamental structural feature of Germandomestic and international politics ever since.The favored patterns and techniques of this power structure surveyed in thisbook thus concentrate on a number of areas:1)The organization of the functions of the state around, and their integrationin, cartel-like and trust-like corporate structures, which in their turn imposeregulatory state bureaucracies by-passing legislative processes in favor ofbureaucratic regulatory systems;2)These structures in turn also incorporate the “cartelization of currency” intoa German-dominated currency zone, which were definite war aims of the Nazis andtheir cartel allies. These aims were not only explicitly stated during World WarTwo, but detailed plans were made to implement them after the war. In theretrospective of history, the outcome of the war did not modify nor affect thoseplans, it merely delayed them;3)The relationship between finance and physics that I have outlined in previousbooks 1 [text00006.html#fn1] was continued by the Nazis not only during the warwith their advanced research projects and their deep connections to large Germancorporate combines, but after the war. In this connection, in my book The NaziInternational I have detailed the “fusion” project of Dr. Ronald Richter inArgentina after the war, and its peculiar connection to the A.E.G. company,which was also heavily involved in the Nazi Bell project. That connection ofhigh finance and corporate cartelism is examined in this book in connection withCERN’s Large Hadron Collider project, a project that I have called “theCosmology Cartel,” for reasons that will become apparent in the main text. Heretoo, the persistency and consistency of the patterns of history are disturbinglyprofound. However, this topic could only be broached once the historicalbackground was adequately laid in Babylon’s Banksters and Secrets of the UnifiedField, where I first surveyed the groundbreaking work of electrical engineeringgenius and theorist Gabriel Kron. My examination of the Large Hadron Colliderproject is without any doubt extremely speculative, and one of the mostdifficult chapters in any book I’ve ever written, due to its terriblecosmological implications. These, as the reader will discover, are verydifferent than the world-destroying scenarios being bandied about by mostconspiracy theorists speculating about the Collider, for they are of a verydifferent nature and go directly to the cosmological and philosophicalimplications of quantum mechanics and little-considered aspects of the CERNproject. 4) Yet other patterns in evidence and reviewed here are the consistentand persistent use by the Euro-German cartel elites of radical Islam, and thesupply of advanced weapons technologies to “pariah states” as a means ofdestabilization in which the interests of the this cabal can be advanced as theleader of the West, America, rushes around the world trying to plug the leaks inthe dike. One may view this as the “weaponization of radical religion,” atechnique and program begun under the Kaiser, and continued unabated by theNazis. Viewed in such a context, the “War on Terror” may be a convenient way ofdisguising a “War with the Nazi International.”There is a final and most important matter that this book attempts to outlineand explore, though admittedly, the topic would require of thick volume of itsown in order to treat it adequately. That matter and topic is one of thoseobvious things that, until one points it out, one does not notice it. Indeed, itis so obvious it is in my opinion astonishing that no author or researcher has(to my knowledge at least) either stated it, nor attempted to deal with it andspeculate on what it might mean for historiography and the interpretation ofevents, particularly the events of the stormy post-war American domesticpolitical scene, from the bewildering rush to expose “security risks” within thepostwar departments of American government in the activities of the HouseUn-American Activities Committee, the various McCarthy episodes and his SenateCommittee on Government Operations, to the efforts of the McCarran Committeeinvestigations of Mafia operations, to the political assassinations of the1960s.There is a historiographical problematic staring us in the face during this era,and it has always perplexed me that no one has stated it nor attempted to dealwith it, much less speculate on what its presence might portend for subsequentevents. That problematic may be bluntly stated as follows: It is undeniable thatthere was deep, and pervasive, Communist infiltration and influence within theFederal Government, beginning during World War Two. The recent declassificationof the Venona intercepts, America’s decryption of wartime and postwar Sovietcommunications, have revealed the pervasive and high-reaching extent andinfluence of this infiltration, causing some authors to reassess the whole imageof one of its most notorious expositors in American politics. Some of the mostfamous names in American politics achieved their early rise to power beinginvolved with this effort: Senator McCarthy, of course, is the one that springsto most people’s minds. But equally, Robert Kennedy and Richard Nixon begantheir political careers through direct involvement with these efforts, andseveral other careers were launched as a consequence of them or played a keyrole in them: Barry Goldwater, Everett Dirksen, Hubert Humphrey, Karl Mundt.Yet, similarly, it is also an undeniable fact that the USA deliberatelyrecruited Nazis for its postwar black projects, and, moreover, made anincredibly Faustian bargain with the head of German military intelligence on theEastern Front, General Reinhard Gehlen. Here again, the postwar influence ofNazis within American governmental structures and policy formation has been asubject of historical research and speculation. 2 [text00006.html#fn2]To put the point succinctly, by the early 1950s, the national security apparatusof the United States contained within it both a Communist faction and a Nazifaction. Yet, no one seems to have noticed this very obvious fact much less havespeculated on what it might mean or imply for the interpretation of postwarevents. Could it be that behind the uproar of the late 1940s and 1950s over “theRed scare,” that a much deeper covert warfare was being waged between these twofactions, as each sought to expose and remove the influence of the other withinthe Federal government? While the answer to that question would, as indicated,require a volume or volumes of its own to answer in detail, I believe that theanswer to it might be a tentative “yes,” and that answer is explored in thethird part of this work. As we shall see, there are details lurking in recenthistorical reevaluations of the career and allegations of the period’s mostnotorious representative, Senator Joseph McCarthy, that tie directly to themes Ihave explored in other books, themes of hidden systems of finance, Axis loot,obfuscated gold, and a Fascist International, that the revisionist historians,by remaining fixed only on the substance of the Senator’sallegations—Communism—overlook.Joseph P.

That’s where Nazism has to be defeated.”Sergei Glazyev, Russian economist and advisor to Russian President VladimirPutin 1 [text00008.html#fn1]I N 1950, THE GERMAN GEOPOLITICAL CENTER IN MADRID , a thinly-disguised Naziorganization, circulated a lengthy and remarkable top secret document among itsmembers, outlining the geopolitical policies and goals for a remarkable group ofhighly connected people, a group I have variously called The Nazi International,or The Fascist International. One might reasonably call it the Post-War AxisInternational, a kind of extra-territorial international Axis state comprised ofelements of the militaries, intelligence apparatuses, propaganda and foreignministries of the former Axis powers and their satellites, a crazy patchworkquilt of Japanese naval officers, former Kempai Tei, Yakuza, German veteransfrom all services branches, elements of Joachim von Ribbentrop’s ForeignMinistry, the Nazi Party Chancery, the SD, veterans from the Italian Fascistparty and the Regia Marina, Belgian Rexists, Dutch Nazis and CroatianUstashi…they were all included. What united them was a common ideology andpurpose: the ideology was power—raw and naked power—and a determination tooppose and ultimately defeat Communism, and then the West’s major power, theUnited States of America. To achieve this end, they allied themselves with thosewithin the target blocs who shared their ideology of an international corporatesocialism, of an international Fascist order.It was, and remains, an elite of evil, connected to the very highest echelons ofwestern power and to the very depths of international criminal organizations.And judging by the plunge of western “democracies” and “republics” into the mostdraconian police states imaginable—with a camera at every stoplight andfundamental freedoms going back to the Magna Carta under assault, whilebanksters who have perpetrated some of the most massive fraud in history notonly are not behind bars, but have awarded themselves fat bonuses, while elected“representatives” are increasingly evidently but two sides of one Fascistcoin—they have been wildly successful not only at surviving, but intransplanting their ideology into the very institutions of power of their formerenemies.In short, if the United States, or the United Kingdom and British Commonwealthnations, or the European Union, or NATO, the policy pronouncements of the IMF orBIS (Bank of International Settlements) look increasingly Fascist, then this isbecause it is the result of the bargains and deals struck with the Fascist devilby elements of American intelligence at the end of the Second World War.Germany surrendered, but the Nazis did not. 2 [text00008.html#fn2]A.

It contents—besides the “Madrid Circular”—consist of aseries of magazine articles and oped pieces from various West German mediaorgans and officials of the government of West Germany’s first post-warChancellor, Konrad Audenauer, which, Tetens argued, were either staffed withformer Nazis or which were beholden to them.However, there are two problems with the document. The first is that thedocument—so far as this author has been able to verify to the present time—hasno provenance. It exists nowhere else, and in its entirety, other than inTetens’ 1953 book. The second is that notwithstanding this lack of provenance,the breathtaking geopolitical scope of its contents are so sweeping that thecurrent structures of the European Union are implicated, and this in a bookpublished in 1953! Indeed, when one reads the Madrid Circular, many aspects ofthe document strike one as being almost surreally applicable to the geopoliticaland financial world of 2015, and not 1950, the year of its purportedcomposition.This implies that one method to verify or disprove its provenance is to examineits contents in detail, and seek to verify those contents with respect to Germanwar aims going back to the First World War, and structures and statements fromGerman and other European Union advocates after World War Two. Parallelisms willthus tend to establish authenticity.B. The Contents of the Madrid CircularThe document itself is titled “The War in Korea and World PoliticalPossibilities for Germany and Europe,” and is classified “Top Secret!” 3[text00008.html#fn3] Its purported distribution includes a very short list,attached to the end of the document, which reads simply, and somewhatmysteriously:Dr. M.v. T., BonnRomBarcelona,Buenos Aires,Z.A. 4 [text00008.html#fn4]While I have been unable to identify either of the two personal names—the Dr. M.and “v. T., Bonn”—what does emerge from this rather vague list is that theMadrid circular had a rather broad distribution to all the typical centers ofthe postwar Axis International: Bonn, Buenos Aires, Rome, and Barcelona. 5[text00008.html#fn5]Additionally, the document is divided into the following sections:1. The World Situation Five Years After Potsdam 6 [text00008.html#fn6]2. The Role of Germany and Europe in the Present Crisis 7 [text00008.html#fn7]3. Korea—A Risky Gamble for Washington 8 [text00008.html#fn8]4. The Political and Military Strength of the United States 9[text00008.html#fn9]5. Has Germany an Obligation towards the United States? 10 [text00008.html#fn10]6. The Expellees (“Die Heimatvertriebenen”) 11 [text00008.html#fn11]7. Weltanschauung and World Power Politics 12 [text00008.html#fn12] Prospectsfor the Future 13 [text00008.html#fn13]Finally, the document purports to have been composed in September of 1950. 14[text00008.html#fn14]Such incidentals are far removed, however, from the explosive contents of thedocument itself. In order to aid in a review of those contents, I have dividedthe document into different subject headers to illustrate its contemporarysignificance.1. The Cold War, Europe, and The Third WayAccording to the Madrid Circular, the beginning of the Korean War affords theperfect opportunity “to Germany if she follows a prudent foreign policy; infact, Germany has already gained many advantages thanks to the present warsituation.” 15 [text00008.html#fn15] These “great opportunities” can only berealized, however, by avoiding any “development whereby Europe will be destroyedbetween the Russian and American millstones.” 16 [text00008.html#fn16] In otherwords, West German, and hence wider European, foreign policy must simultaneouslyexploit tensions between the Soviet Russian bloc of the East, and theAnglo-American bloc in the est, while keeping those tensions focused away fromthe European heartland. If this sounds vaguely similar to French and Germandiplomacy in the wake of the current crisis in the Ukraine, that’s because itis.But there’s more.“The aim of German policy, and that of Europe as a whole,” the GermanGeopolitical Center informs us, “must be to remain neutral in any new worldconflict no matter the circumstances .” 17 [text00008.html#fn17] What isnoteworthy here is the confident tone of the statement, not only formulating apolicy position for Germany, but for the whole of Europe, which at this stage ofhistory, was only beginning to form itself into the Common Market. The Europeanmonetary union was still decades in the future, and a common European politicalstructure of union still remains to be achieved. As will be seen momentarily,the goals of a common customs, monetary, and political union are all goals ofthe German Geopolitical Center in Madrid, and thus its sponsoring “AxisInternational.” Thus, the statement is not mere bravado or wishful thinking; itis policy, and the attitude formulating it is one of a brutally cynicalRealpolitik view of the postwar world.This cynicism becomes immediately apparent when this policy of neutrality “nomatter the circumstances” is explained a little further on:England and France today are perhaps more dependent on the United States thanthe still occupied West German Republic.Europe, on the one hand, is today in an unenviable strategic position, but, onthe other hand, it enjoys the advantage of being the geopolitical center astridethe Soviet colossus and the U.S.A. Present circumstances make it thereforenecessary for Europe to be on guard against both sides in other to avoid beingswallowed up by one of the two colossi. The dollar imperialism is certainly inno way less aggressive or reckless than communism. The British and French,although former “allies” and “victors” feel the impact of that arrogant dollardiplomacy to a greater extent than we Germans whose sympathy they (USA) hope togain.Today Western Europe is relegated to the role of a satellite acting on behalf ofAmerica. Schuman in France, and Bevin in England, dance to the tune of the piperin Washington. Europe is being used as the playground for the impudent andshameless dollar diplomacy. Thanks to their solid political education, middleclass and labor in Germany have been able to grasp the whole situation in time .18 [text00008.html#fn18]There are a number of important and subtle points in this passage:1)the statement notes that Europe, while at that time divided by the IronCurtain between the Warsaw Pact and the emerging Atlantic-NATO alliance system,was—at least as far as the Western half went—a potential power bloc of its own;2)the passage also is one of the first in postwar literature to note that thebasis of American power was what it calls “dollar diplomacy,” a phrase which inthis case one may take to be a shorthand expression for the instrumentalities ofAmerican financial power:a)the Federal Reserve, the US sovereign securities markets, the ExchangeStabilization Fund,b)the institutions and mechanisms of international finance established in thewake of the Bretton-Woods agreement, i.e., the IMF and World Bank; and last, butsurely not least,c)the American use of some of the recovered Axis plunder from Europe and Asia inthe establishment of a mechanism of hidden finance for covert operations againstCommunism and as a mechanism for financing a long-term technologicaldevelopment, 19 [text00008.html#fn19] a system of finance which, in itsutilization of that Axis plunder, the German Geopolitical Center in Madrid, oneof the vital components of the postwar Nazi International, would almostcertainly have had at least some knowledge of;3)finally, the passage points out that the German population, a mere five yearsafter the war, was still to a great extent under the influence of the Nazieducation system, and as such was “able to grasp the whole” geopolitical anddiplomatic “situation in time,” a clever and euphemistic generalization for theperception that Nazi indoctrination created the perception that both SovietCommunism and Western capitalism were antithetical to Europe’s, and Germany’s,best interest. National Socialism, Fascism, was that “third way,” the middlesynthesis, of the two antithetical systems.It is when one begins to contemplate the implications of the fact that theMadrid German Geopolitical Center certainly knew of the vast Axis lootunderpinning much of that “dollar diplomacy” in the form of a covert actionslush fund against Communism 20 [text00008.html#fn20] that the cynicism of thedocument becomes more evident, for that knowledge meant that while Americandollars were flowing into Western Europe in the form of American “aid,” some ofthat aid was in the form of Axis plunder. Thus, the German Geopolitical Centerand the long term Nazi postwar policy benefits twice from one “investment” inthat it profits from that “dollar diplomacy” while simultaneously stokes thefire of resentment for the subservient status it brings to the European powersand their populations.As a result, the Circular states its first long term foreign policy goal in nouncertain terms:During the forthcoming months, Germany’s foreign policy must be geared to asubtler exploitation of the conflict between the eastern and western blocs. Ouraim in the immediate future must be to regain full sovereignty for WesternGermany which will eventually result in the restoration of freedom of action tothe whole of Europe. With accelerated speed we are approaching the point atwhich we must liberate Europe from American control. It is up to us to determinethe method and the timing. 21 [text00008.html#fn21]Note that once again regaining of “full sovereignty for Western Germany” iscoupled to the idea of a “freedom of action” for “the whole of Europe.” In otherwords, the German Geopolitical Center has seen the reality of the politicalsituation clearly: against the two immense powers of the USA and USSR,traditional European power politics have no place for the simple reason that theEuropean powers individually—Italy, France, Great Britain, and Germany—haveneither the economic strength nor the military and strategic depth to competewith them individually.Additionally, the goal of an “America-free” Europe is enunciated for the firsttime, and this in a context that seeks to preclude any independent French orBritish rapprochement with Russia:There is the danger that France or England—perhaps even both jointly—will returnto an independent policy. One or the other of these powers might come to anagreement with Russia and, in either case, this would be at the expense ofGermany and the United States. Such a possibility must be avoided at all cost.Germany must remain the decisive factor in European politics and it is up to herto give the word at the right time.German foreign policy must be directed with a view to steering Europe clear fromanother world conflict. Conditions for such policy are favorable. The Europeannations long for peace. The self-interests of France and England categoricallydemand that a new holocaust must be avoided. The interests of the Vatican runalong the same lines. Our paramount attention must be devoted to thepreservation of German strength and its native potential (“Erhaltung derdeutschen Substanz”). 22 [text00008.html#fn22]In other words, the other two major European powers must have their freedom ofaction restricted and bound to that of Germany.And that, of course, is best achieved through some sort of European federation,by binding the economic, and eventually political institutions of Western Europetogether. In the context of a European federation, the European train will gowhere the German locomotive goes.Noting that “the prevalent mood in every country of Europe is against war, andin England broad masses of the people are convinced that the next war will beone provoked by America,” 23 [text00008.html#fn23] the Madrid Circular thencynically notes that “A war of exhaustion between Russia and America in whichEurope could be spared, would automatically result in the upsurge of a thirdpower bloc,” 24 [text00008.html#fn24] namely, a German-led Europe itself. 25[text00008.html#fn25] In pursuit of the goal of “liberating Europe fromAmerica,” the Circular advocates a “conscious policy of neutrality, going handin hand with close economic cooperation with the East,” a policy which “would,from a long range point of view, supersede a merely pro-Soviet orientation. Theformer would finally bring about our freedom, while the last would keep us inthe status of vassals.” 26 [text00008.html#fn26] Oddly enough, this appears tobe precisely the policy that Germany, and hence, Europe, has followed vis-à-visRussia and Asia, in the form of the powerful BRICSA bloc of Russia, China,Brazil, India, and South Africa, since the German reunification in 1992. To thisend, the Circular advocates yet another policy that has become a familiar policyof recent French and German governments and indeed, a familiar policy to thewider European Union:We must not forget that Germany has always considered orientation towards theWest as a policy of expediency or one to be pursued only under pressure ofcircumstances. Such was the case in Napoleon’s time, after 1918, and also after1945. All of our great national leaders have constantly counseled the long-rangepolicy of close cooperation with the East; thus, Frederick the Great, Count vonStein, Bismarck, von Seeckt, Brockdorff-Rentzau, and, in the past 30 years, allour leading geopoliticians. 27 [text00008.html#fn27]The pertinent question here is whether the resemblance between currentGermano-European policy and that of the Madrid Circular is merely coincidental,or whether the Madrid Circular’s policy recommendations are reflective of deepereconomic and ideological goals and players.While the answer to that question remains to be seen in the coming chapters,what is significant in the above list is the mention of von Seekt. Generaloberst28 [text00008.html#fn28] Hans Von Seeckt (1866-1936) was the post-World War Onehead of the small German military permitted by the Versailles Treaty, theReichswehr. This was restricted to an army of no more than 100,000 men, and asmall coastal defense navy with capital ships limited to a mere 10,000 tonsdisplacement. The army was further restricted to artillery of not larger than15cm caliber, and was not allowed to possess tanks or combat aircraft. VonSeeckt, far from seeing this as a limitation, understood it as an opportunity,and drilled the small German Army relentlessly, creating a nucleus thereby of avastly expanded officer corps which, when conscription was eventually restored,would result in that army becoming the core of a highly competent andprofessional, and quite large, officer corps thoroughly trained in staff workaround which conscripts could be grafted. Von Seeckt also insisted on the secretprotocols to the Rapallo Treaty (1922) between the Soviet Union and the WeimarRepublic, which allowed German soldiers to train secretly in Russia using thevery tanks, aircraft, and heavy artillery not permitted to them under theVersailles Treaty. Under this secret arrangement between the two European pariahstates of the time, the Germans built factories for the production of tanks,artillery, and aircraft in the Soviet Union, which provided the weapons to theRussians and Germans training there. It is an irony of this arrangement thatmany of the German and Russian officers who trained together in the 1920s, facedeach other as enemies during Operation Barbarossa. 29 [text00008.html#fn29]The mention of von Seeckt is thus highly symbolic, for he represents thedeliberate and early, pre-Nazi era intention to secretly circumvent any armslimitations imposed on Germany by treaty, a symbolism that could not have beenlost to the German leaders reading the post-World War Two Madrid Circular. Thepolicy was carefully followed by post-World War Two West Germany as well, whichbegan various covert rearmaments programs with other “pariah nations” following“the Rapallo Template,” including atomic bomb programs with South Africa andIsrael, and more recently as we shall see subsequently, Iran(!) designed tocreate a German nuclear deterrent via proxy nations that would do the actualdevelopment and testing of a weapon, utilizing German technology. 30[text00008.html#fn30]Von Seekct also symbolizes something else, and that is the extent to whichWeimar Germany remained a continuation of the German Empire of Kaiser Wilhelm.Indeed, post-Wilhelmine Germany was but a mirror image of the Kaiser’s: the samecorporate and military elites held power, only the symbolic head of theregime—the Kaiser—had been changed. Not surprisingly, the Madrid Circularalludes to the persistence of this very same elite after World War Two as well,in yet another of its policy recommendations, one in which the clear long termgoal is stated in all its naked Nazi goose-stepping glory:What Germany needs in the future is not democracy but a system of statecraftsimilar to that of the Soviet dictatorship which would enable the political andmilitary elite in Germany to organize the industrial capacity of Europe and themilitary qualities of the German people for the revival of the German race andthe re-establishment of Europe as the power center in the world. 31[text00008.html#fn31]The question of continuity between the Madrid Circular’s assertions and theactual realities of postwar Europe has once again resurfaced in yet anotherform: are there any indicators that that elite is continuous from the Kaiser,down through the Weimar and Nazi periods, to the post-war (West) German FederalRepublic (Bundesrepublik Deutschland)? That answer to that question, and toother questions of ideological, policy, economic, and conceptual continuity mustawait future chapters, but for the present, it is to be noted that the MadridCircular simply assumes it to be the case. The assertion in the statement issubtle, but nonetheless very clear: the German political and military elite hascontinued after the war.2. More Madrid Circular Cynicism: The Korean War, The British Problematic, TheAmerican Economy and MilitaryAs if all of this generalization was not enough, the document begins to show notonly the true depths of its cynicism but its true subtlety when it begins todwell on specifics, in this case, the postwar Great Britain and the unwinding ofthe British Empire in the context of the emerging Korean War. “There are,” notesthe Circular,indications that the British have supported United States policy in Korea onlyhalfheartedly. If the Americans are thrown out of Korea, then British prestigein the whole of Asia would suffer; but even if the Yankees should provevictorious, then the hatred of all Asia would be roused with the same intensityagainst the British as against the Americans. The British view with greatdistaste the clumsy hand of Washington meddling in their Asiatic affairs. Londonremembers with great bitterness the noisy pro-Indian propaganda carried on inthe United States during the war. London realizes that not Russia but the UnitedStates must be blamed as the gravedigger of the British Empire. The UnitedStates entered the world war supposedly to save England, but worked with greatzeal to junk the British Empire. 32 [text00008.html#fn32]It does not take much reading between the lines to understand that what theCircular is proposing is to exploit disenchantment among the British elite atthe policies advocated during and immediately after the Second World War by theRoosevelt Administration. The goal is equally obvious, though not explicitlystated: this exploitation of the grievances of the British oligarchy would befor the purpose of enticing Great Britain to abandon its centuries’ longdiplomatic policy of maintaining its sovereignty aloof from continental politicsand entanglements, unless the European balance of power was so fundamentallyaltered as to endanger British national security. In this case, the circular isnot-so-subtly pointing out that the real potential threat to Britain came fromits former colony across the Atlantic. 33 [text00008.html#fn33]With similar analytical precision, one heavy with implications given theCircular’s later vague reference to exploiting Islam and to asymmetric warfare,the Circular points out that the American military, while technologicallyformidable, has an Achilles’ heel, in that its very technological prowess meansthat “its armed forces are limited and extremely expensive.” 34[text00008.html#fn34] A little further on, this assessment is buttressed withsome typical Nazi arrogance, coupled with a penetrating diagnosis of America’sinability to sustain long term warfare due to lack of popular support, and itsreliance upon alliances formed by “dollar diplomacy” rather than shared economicand geopolitical interests:Although they can throw billions of dollars around, they do not possesstop-notch statesmen, planners, military leaders, scientists, nor a peoplewilling to make sacrifices and capable of accomplishing great historic feats.They do not even have an attractive ideal. The crux of American miscalculationis the belief that allies can be bought with dollars. Alliances are not cementedwith ideologies but rest squarely on common interests. Alliances too arerespected as long as interests remain mutual. But America’s interests do not runparallel with those of Asia or Europe, not even with those of Britain or LatinAmerica. 35 [text00008.html#fn35]While one can argue (as if it needed any argument) that Nazism is hardly “anattractive ideal,” the remainder of the analysis is again eerily prescient ofcontemporary conditions, as American actions on the world stage increasinglyalienate allies, and as the recent Ukrainian-Russian sanctions crisis evidences:Europe has very little to gain, and much to lose, by American confrontation withRussia, especially since so much of Europe’s energy supply comes from Russia,and so much of its trade is directed not toward the USA, but to Asia.But contemporary contexts aside, what did the statement mean for the MadridGerman Geopolitical Center in September of 1950? For the Madrid Circular, itmeant that West Germany’s position vis-à-vis the United States was quiteconvenient, as “The Yankees are willing to pay a high price for our help.”Indeed, as I have noted elsewhere, a scant four years later, Nazis in theservice of the CIA and General Reinhard Gehlen would aid Gamel Abdul Nasser’soverthrow of King Farouk and kick the British and French interests out of Egypt.36 [text00008.html#fn36] That willingness to “pay a high price for our help,”moreover, was made clear to the Madrid German Geopolitical Center was made clear“from all confidential reports which we have obtained from circles close to theAmerican High Commissioner.” 37 [text00008.html#fn37] This is a rather stunningadmission, for in 1950, the American High Commissioner for Germany was noneother than John J. McCloy (1895-1989), who served in that capacity from 1949 to1952. McCloy, it will also be recalled, pardoned over 70,000 Nazis (allowingthem entry into postwar West German politics), was the American lawyer for I.G.Farben before the war, shared Hitler’s box in that capacity during the 1936Berlin Olympics, and was also a member of the Warren Commission investigating(or rather, covering up) the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. 38[text00008.html#fn38] In other words, the Madrid Circular is stating, clearlyand unequivocally, that it was gaining intelligence from the offices of John J.McCloy, American High Commissioner for Germany, who in turn had deep andextensive connections to the massive German chemicals and armaments combine,I.G. Farben!3. The Five Years Since Potsdam and the Post-War Nazi Diplomatic Offensivea. The Postwar Nazi Propaganda OffensiveIt is when the Madrid Circular turns specifically to its chief concern, Germany,that some of its most amazing assertions are made, assertions that, on firstreading, seem ludicrous but which upon a little reflection seem to be confirmedby its confident analysis. Here one must spend some time unpacking theseassertions.Germany has emerged from the world war as the chief beneficiary. That is ourgreat asset in the ledger of the 5-year period since Potsdam. For the first timein the history of nations it has been proven that clever propaganda, especiallywhen it is camouflaged and directed through other channels, accomplished farmore than then mightiest army or the best diplomatic service of asmoothly-functioning state.…We are not wholly innocent in the shift of America’spost-war policy. For us the war has never stopped and, as is well known, in warevery ruse is permissible. We cannot repeat too often that Germany never hasceased to carry on the war with political weapons and propaganda, with economicsabotage and other means. In order to protect Germany against total destructionof its military and economic potentials, as planned at Yalta, we blueprinted abold plan and created a flexible and smoothly-working organization which, at theend of the war, provided the precondition for all the gains that by necessityemerged for Germany out of the chaos of the postwar period.… Today, however,five years after Potsdam, we can look back with pride on our accomplishments. 39[text00008.html#fn39]Observe very carefully what is being asserted here:1)The war “never stopped” for the Nazis, a statement oddly condign to the factthat, as I pointed out in The Nazi International, there was no representative ofthe Nazi Party signing at any of the German surrenders in 1945, nor was thereany declaration that the Nazi Party was declaring itself a criminal organizationand signing itself out of existence, a codicil of the surrender instruments thatseems curiously and oddly missing, given the fact that the Allies—France, GreatBritain, the USA and USSR and smaller powers—could have insisted upon thepresence of a Nazi Party representative and on such a codicil. In this respect,therefore, the assertions of the Madrid Circular seem oddly corroborated by thecircumstances of the German surrender(s) itself/ themselves; 40[text00008.html#fn40]2)Additionally, the Circular is also asserting that, the capitulation of theGerman Wehrmacht notwithstanding, for the German state (Reich) the war did notstop. Again, this seems like the height of lunacy on first glance, for in 1950,Germany was still digging out from the rubble. Yet, the assertion is again veryoddly corroborated by the circumstances of the two German surrenders in Rheims,France, on May 7, 1945, and again on May 8, 1945, in Berlin, for at bothsurrenders, only representatives of the German military signed any surrenderdocument. There was no signatory for the Nazi Party, nor was there any signatoryfor the Reich Government itself, at that time headed by Grand Admiral KarlDönitz, Hitler’s designated and official successor as Reichpräsident. The onlysignatories of those surrender instruments were General Alfred Jodl(at theRheims surrender), and Field Marshal Keitel, Admiral von Friedeburg, and GeneralStumpff at the Berlin ceremony, each representing the three service branches ofthe German Wehrmacht. 41 [text00008.html#fn41]3)Finally, and most significantly, the Circular is taking credit for thederailment of the Morgenthau Plan for postwar Germany, approved by PresidentRoosevelt, and subsequently approved by the other two principal Allied Powers,Great Britain and the Soviet Union at the Yalta conference of 1944. This plan,with which we shall be subsequently concerned, would have completelyde-industrialized Germany, reduced its population—by what means is unclear—byover fifty percent, and split the country permanently into three smallernations.b. Managing the Collapse of the ReichBut these wild though strangely corroborated assertions are followed up witheven more sweeping claims:Future historians will one day reveal the great vision with which responsibleleaders of the Third Reich created with confident determination those measureswhich subsequently smashed the united front of the enemy and made Germany againa much-desired partner in a new politico-strategic alliance.… By no means didthe political and military leadership of the Third Reich skid into thecatastrophe in an irrational manner as so many blockheads and ignoramuses oftentell us. The various phases and consequences of the so-called “collapse’(“Zusammenbruch”) were thoroughly studied and planned by the most capableexperts (“faehigsten Koepfen”). Nothing occurred by chance; everything wascarefully planned. The result of this planning was that, already a few monthsafter Potsdam, the conditions of the victors went on the rocks. 42[text00008.html#fn42]To the above list of assertions one may now add two more:4)The postwar fracturing of the alliance of France, Great Britain, the USA, andUSSR was to some extent aided and exacerbated by the activities of the postwarNazi International; and,5)The phases of the immanent collapse of the Third Reich in the final months ofthe war—one may assume from the German defeat at Stalingrad in early 1943—wasstudied and “carefully planned,” presumably with a view to mitigating as muchlong-term damage to German heavy industry and military potential as possible.This study may have been, and in this author’s opinion, probably was conductedin conjunction with the strategic evacuation plans that Martin Bormann and othertop Nazis began to put into play after the Stalingrad disaster. 43[text00008.html#fn43]c. Utilizing the Pro-German American Business and Financial EliteIn addition to this “management of the phases of collapse,” the Madrid Circularalso places these statements in the context of an indicator of how thatmanagement—and eventual recovery—was to be accomplished: by the fullestutilization of the pro-German business connections that had existed before, andeven during, the Second World War:The decision for a Western or Eastern orientation was influenced by factors ofRealpolitik. In the light of conditions prevailing in 1945, we could expect fromonly the West—or rather from the United States—moderate conditions for anarmistice, measure of relief, and a sympathetic understanding. Only in Americadid there exist at that time a small but influential group who had not fallenvictim to the hate and revenge outcry of the Jewish triumvirateRosenfeld-Morgenthau-Baruch, but had maintained in a well-concealed butconsistent manner throughout the war its sympathy for Germany. 44[text00008.html#fn44]In a certain sense, this slurring reference to the Roosevelt administration asthe “Rosenfeld-Morgenthau-Baruch” triumvirate speaks to the possibleauthenticity of the Circular’s origins within the postwar Nazi high cabal. Moreimportantly, while volumes of material have been written about the pre-war,wartime, and postwar financial connections between American business and Nazism,45 [text00008.html#fn45] these studies tend not to view the connections betweenAmerican and German business in any sort of connection with the emergence of theEuropean Union. As we shall discover in this book, there is ample reason to doso.In any case, the Circular then goes on to make, in this context, yet anotherastonishing assertion:In order to bring the Americans back to reason and away from Potsdam, weorganized chaotic conditions in a thorough and systematic manner (“haben wir mitgruendlicher Systematik das Chaos organisiert”). It was a subtle politicalresistance, seemingly unorganized and seldom visible, but nonetheless having adeadly effect. The peasants were delivering almost next to nothing to thecities; no coal was brought up from the pits, the wheels of industry were notturning, the people came near to starvation; the monetary systems weredisintegrating—there remained nothing for the Yankees to do but give in andscrap the Potsdam program.…As a consequence, not only did the front of our enemies break wide apart, butthe Soviets too were forced to abandon their mad program of destruction inEastern Germany.…This could only have been achieved by the leaders of the ThirdReich through superb planning in the realm of psychological and politicalwarfare within the United States before and even during the war. 46[text00008.html#fn46]There are two ways to read these assertions: either the postwar collapse of theGerman infrastructure and commercial activity was entirely a consequence of thecollapse of the Reich under the Allied onslaught, and the postwar NaziInternational is simply laying claim to having orchestrated it, or the collapsewas, as the document asserts, to some extent organized and exacerbated bydeliberate postwar covert activity of the surviving Party organizations.Given the organization of the ratline activity of these organizations to aidNazis, Fascists, Utashi, Belgian Rexists and other national fascist groups toescape Europe, I am inclined to take the second view, that the postwar collapseof the German economy in all the Allied occupation zones was to some extentaided and exacerbated by these groups. The result, as the document itself avers,was the abandonment of the Yalta-Potsdam program of the completede-industrialization of Germany, for as the tensions between the western Alliesand the Soviets ratcheted up, both sides saw in the industrial potential ofGermany a useful ally against the other. So successful was this program that theCircular itself observes that the crack-up of the wartime alliance and the grantof limited sovereignty to West Germany was accomplished fully ten to fifteenyears ahead of the schedule that the Nazi leadership had predicted. 47[text00008.html#fn47]More importantly, the Circular suggests something else, namely, that this planwas accomplished by psychological operations inside the USA itself, doubtlessutilizing the very same business connections that it confidently states earlierthat it relied upon. As will be seen eventually, this too is not very wide ofthe actual mark, yet another indicator that the Circular may indeed be anauthentic document.d. The Appearance of the Lack of OrganizationAccording to the Circular, one key feature enabling the covert management ofthis “collapse” and “recovery” was the “deliberate” collapse of the Nazi Partyitself, and the sudden postwar emergence of “aid” societies, often in the formof societies whose names—Evangelical Relief Society and so on—would seem to havenothing to do with National Socialism. The other aspect of this program was thereemergence of the political parties that had been banned by the Nazi statebefore the war, thoroughly infiltrated by the Nazis, of course:Even after the collapse, the National Socialist Party continued to work in acamouflaged way (“getarnt”) in dozens of seemingly innocuous societies andgroups, in order to keep alive and undiluted the national outlook of the Germanpeople. In the same way as many small brooks go toward making a mighty stream,the various nationalistic and radical groups in the Zonen-Reich carried out,almost without exception, worth-while and powerful propaganda.…The more diverseand unconnected these groups appeared on the surface, the less they were apt toarouse suspicion (of the Occupying authorities) that they were directed andinfluenced by a central organization. 48 [text00008.html#fn48]In other words, behind a plethora of small, seemingly harmless relief, aid, andcharity organizations, and even behind the re-emergence of less radicalizedpolitical parties such as the Christian Democratic Union of Social Democrats,lurked the Nazi Party, which had driven itself underground and, like a secretsociety cum intelligence organization, was coordinating all the activity. Thistechnique, incidentally, we shall encounter again, in a very different context.4. Dollar Diplomacy, Spies, and an “Anti-Dollar Diplomacy”Bloca. The Predicted Failure of American PolicySome of the more prescient long-range predictions the German Geopolitical Centermakes in its 1950 Madrid Circular regard the strategic implications andconsequences of the policies that the USA embarked upon in the immediate postwarperiod, consequences that, in the detailed exposition of the Circular, seem alltoo contemporary, as the USA encounters increasing opposition from its EuropeanAllies, attempts to “pivot to the Pacific,” and is dealing with a rash ofdestabilizing activities in the Muslim world. The Circular contextualizes theseclaims within a general framework:After the failure of their amateurish policies in Asia, the Americans will oneday experience a far more painful and devastating smashup in Europe. The outcomewill be as we predicted as long ago as 1944: they will rouse the whole worldagainst them. 49 [text00008.html#fn49]To put it in a somewhat more historical context, the Circular is maintainingthat the ultimate outcome of American “dollar diplomacy,” an outcome itmaintains the Nazi leadership predicted in in 1944, would be no more successfulthan the Most Serene Republic of Venice’s “ducat diplomacy” centuries before,for then too, “ducat diplomacy” led to a general corruption and a diplomaticduplicity and heavy-handedness that eventually led the whole of Europe to form acoalition for the permanent destruction of Venice in the War of the League ofCambrai. 50 [text00008.html#fn50]Indeed, during this prolonged and “extended transitory period” of “profoundchange in international power relations,” the Circular offers the observationthat “it should prove possible for Germany to build up a new political bloc outof Europe, Africa, and Latin America.” 51 [text00008.html#fn51] Again, one isstruck by the prescience of the Circular, for while contemporary Germany isstill very much the central and most important component of the European Union,and not a formal member of the BRICSA bloc—Brazil, Russia, India, China, andSouth Africa—Germany is nonetheless a large trading partner with the two largestBRICSA powers, Russia and China, and is on friendly terms with the other three.It is, in a sense, an informal “member-observer” within that bloc. Moreimportantly, the Circular offers this insight about the creation of a “newpolitical bloc” in the context of an “anti-dollar diplomacy” alliance, which theBRICSA bloc is increasingly turning out to be. And all this, again, in adocument allegedly composed in 1950, and first published in 1953!But Nazis are Nazis, after all, and there is no limit to the degree of their owngrandiosity and duplicity, which the Circular spells out in no uncertain terms:It would then depend entirely on our diplomatic and propaganda finesses when andhow we would take over an America enfeebled by its foreign and domesticpolicies. Such a plan would have the advantage of preventing a third world warfought between United States capitalism and the Soviet bloc—a war which wouldhave the most destructive consequences for the Western world. Such a designwould still guarantee for some time the preservation of the resources of theWestern world and then, greatly strengthened, we will enter—under Germanicleadership—the phase of a final showdown, between the white race and the Slavicworld. In the event of such a showdown, we must endeavor to bring to our sidethe Arab bloc and as many of the Asiatic peoples as possible. Germany is in thefortunate position of not having aroused the hatred of Asia. There we can stepin as the leading spokesman for the underdog. 52 [text00008.html#fn52]In other words, the Circular is proposing that the ultimate goals of the NaziInternational are1)The takeover of the United States by a covert cooption and coup d’etat fromwithin, implying that it has an extensive covert network within that country todo so; and,2)The subsequent use of American military and economic strength to for a finalannihilating showdown with “the Slavic world,” i.e., Russia. All talk ofreconciliation and an eastward orientation are simply a kind of masque anddeception operation, true enough of the coordination of European-German-NaziInternational interests in the mid-term, but not true over the ultimate range ofits goals.One way that the Circular proposes to accomplish this silent coup is by“economic difficulties” that “will one day plunge the United States down fromits present dizzy heights.” This type of widespread “catastrophe can be broughtabout through crafty manipulations and through artificially engendered crises,”53 [text00008.html#fn53] crises made all the easier to orchestrate if such apostwar Nazi International knew of, and had some influence within(as it almostcertainly did) the hidden system of finance created by the USA to fund itsanti-Communist covert operations and secret research projects. 54[text00008.html#fn54]b. The Exploitation of IslamJust how all this grandiose vision is to be achieved is itself quite remarkableand prescient, for the Circular makes it clear that the keystone in the arch ofits plans is the long-term destabilization of Anglo-American interests in theMiddle East, thereby threatening its oil and petroleum lifelines:The tenacious work of enlightenment carried out by Germany and Italy in the Arabworld is now bearing fruit. Anti-British and anti-American resentment is gainingmomentum in the entire Middle East. Britain will not long be able to keep itshold on the Suez Canal, 55 [text00008.html#fn55] nor maintain her influence inIran and the rest of the Middle East. The coming revolt of the Arab world willprove another setback for the amateurish world planners in Washington. 56[text00008.html#fn56]In a previous book, The Nazi International, I have alluded to the fact that NaziGermany aided and sponsored contacts with radicalized Islamicist-terroristgroups, and even fostered their creation.As we shall discover in this book, however, the whole idea of jihad is as much acreation of the German elites and oligarchs as it is a Muslim one. Thus, whilethe Circular in 1950 predicts the end of Anglo-American influence in Iran, theCIA, at the instigation and influence of the British MI-6, overthrew thegovernment of Mohammed Mossadegh and installed the regime of Shah Reza Pahlavi,thus ending—for a period at least—the Iranian challenge to Anglo-Americandominance of that country’s vast oil resources. As we shall discover insubsequent chapters, however, with the regime of the Ayatollahs and theirongoing controversial nuclear program, there is yet another unpleasant, andvirtually unknown, German connection. Jihad, in other words, is but another toolin the Nazi International’s arsenal.c. The Pivot to AsiaThe list of the Madrid German Geopolitical Center’s prescience of the widerpattern of alliances and events of subsequent decades only grows, for theCircular also advocates a policy of a German “pivot to Asia”:Germany’s industry will regain its previous position: the markets in East andSoutheast Europe, in Latin America and in Africa. China and the rest ofSoutheast Asia offer us a great future. There we can eliminate the British andAmericans from competition, especially if we conduct our negotiations with theSoviets in a smart way. Our increasing economic power and ability to elbow ourway politically, must be employed alternately. A prudent and undeviating policywill make it possible to establish some day (sic) a new political order in theworld which will supersede the present colossi—the United States and theU.S.S.R. 57 [text00008.html#fn57]Notice that the Circular is essentially advocating the creation of what amountsto the current BRICSA trading bloc of nations: Brazil(Latin America), Russia,India (Southeast Asia), China, and South Africa (Africa), as a means for theexpansion of German trade and hence, for the expansion of German heavy industry,the combustion engine that has driven German military power throughout thenineteenth and twentieth centuries. Again, one is confronted in such statementsby a stark choice of alternatives: either the Circular has an uncanny andunrealistic ability to predict long-term developments, or its accuracy is due tothe positioning of carefully placed corporate and political agents provocateurwithin the postwar world, a positioning that would be required, and easilyachieved, given (1) the German-American business contacts prior to and duringWorld War Two, and (2) the probable knowledge of and participation in thepostwar hidden system of finance, established by President Truman in 1947, 58[text00008.html#fn58] of the Axis elites in that system.d. Voiding NATO by American AggressionOne of the most stunningly prescient observations and techniques advocated bythe Madrid Circular to void the influence of the United States within theAtlantic system of alliances—NATO—is to rely upon American aggression andunipolarism to do so:All these possibilities would come to naught if a new world war were to layEurope waste. It must therefore be our supreme duty to place ourselves in thevanguard of the struggle to keep Europe out of any future war. If we succeed inthis, we will surely gain the trust of the people and undisputed leadership inEurope, not excluding Britain. In such a roundabout way we would be able toestablish the foundation for future world leadership. The world is longing todayfor the millennium. In the role of champion for peace, we would gain stature inworld public opinion and create for ourselves an unshakable moral position. Thepropaganda against German “militarism” would subside entirely, old charges wouldbe forgotten and Europe would then be willing to follow German leadership. Sucha policy can be pursued successfully, especially in view of the present attitudeof the Vatican. The Pope is a realist in politics…and knows well enough that, inthe age of the Atom bomb, there is too much at stake for the Church and forEurope as a whole.The Atlantic partners will always be able to find an opportunity to evade theirobligations by pointing out that the provocative behavior of the United Stateshas foolishly brought about a conflict for which the Russians cannot be chargedas the aggressor and, therefore, all contractual obligations to help becomevoid. 59 [text00008.html#fn59]Once again, the Circular has proven to be oddly accurate in its forecasting ofevents and the techniques by which Europe in general and Germany in particularwould respond to American unipolarism, for it is not only predicting theemergence of that unipolar attitude, it is providing the mechanism for Europe’swithdrawal from it: aggressive activity on the part of the United States wouldvoid any treaty obligations of the European powers under the NATO system, a factbrought home in recent months by Germany’s resistance to American actions in theUkraine, a resistance that has included publication within the German media ofarticles challenging and falsifying American claims of Russian invasions of theEastern Ukraine, complete with German spy satellite photos to drive the pointhome.5. The First Sensational Statement: The Nazi Plan for a United EuropeAs if all of this were not enough to convince one of the extraordinaryimportance of the Madrid Circular, the document makes two final and almostunbelievable assertions. The first of these is not only that the idea of a“United Europe” was a Nazi goal, but also that this was a policy goal of certaincircles in Washington, D.C. itself after the war. The objective of this policy,however, was to create a United Europe, with Germany as the locomotive,precisely in order to create a bulwark against Communism. 60[text00008.html#fn60] However, this United Europe Plan, and its NATO corollary,was as much about hedging in German power, as it was about confronting Russianpower. 61 [text00008.html#fn61] This, however, was fully known to the MadridGerman Geopolitical Center, which saw in the creation of such a scheme amechanism whereby Germany could fulfill ambitions that went back to the time ofWilhelm II’s Kaiserreich, as we shall discover in subsequent pages.6. The Explosive Assertion Regarding the Bomb Plot against Hitler in July 1944No one can read the bizarre political testament that is the Madrid Circular andcome away with anything less than a queasy feeling of disgust, horror, and evena kind of unwilling admiration for the audacious accuracy of its predictions andgoals. But one thing in particular within its tapestry of policies, goals,techniques, assertions and claims, more than any other, will shake the itsreaders’ perceptions to its very foundations, challenging all the carefullyorchestrated bland statements and stories of “officially sanctioned”historiography.These assertions concern the bomb plot assassination attempt against AdolfHitler of July 20, 1944, a plot that was led by Colonel Klaus Graf(Count) vonStauffenberg, and a plot moreover, we are told, that failed in its objective ofkilling Adolf Hitler.If that was its real objective…Here, as elsewhere, the Madrid Circular stuns and shocks, for according to it,the elimination of Hitler was not the real purpose of the plot, nor of itsaftermath:It was most difficult for the German press to deal delicately with the events ofJuly 20, 1944. The less these events are discussed, the better it will be forGermany’s future. A split among the German people on this question would provedisastrous. There are many angles which obviously cannot as yet be discussedopenly. There were thousands who had reason, or were even ordered to protectthemselves by camouflaging as “anti-Nazis” (“Hitlergegner”). Persons who were atthat time reported as having been shot are still among the living today. Let usalso bear in mind that Dr. Ley’s statement about the “blue-blooded swine” servedthe definite purpose of deceiving the enemy. Our leaders must see to it that theever-recurring discussions about the events of the 20th of July be eitherstopped or, if possible, passed over lightly. Previous directives remainedvalid; no information whatsoever should be revealed about the background of thataffair. 62 [text00008.html#fn62]If one reads this passage carefully, it makes two distinct assertions thatraises many conundrums and implications for the whole bomb plot itself:1)The anti-Hitler resistance was, to some extent, the creation of the Nazihierarchy, as a massive deception and disinformation scheme designed to misleadAllied and Soviet intelligence; 63 [text00008.html#fn63] and,2)The aftermath of the July Bomb plot, with its many thousands of executions,was itself a disinformation masque, designed to deceive Allied and Sovietintelligence by “killing” prominent Nazi leadership. After all, if General “X”or “Minister Y” had been executed, why bother looking for them after the war?These two possibilities raise a disturbing third one: that the Bomb plot itselfwas part of the massive deception operation, leading to more disturbingquestions: was Hitler actually killed? Or was it even the real Hitler who waspresent on July 20, 1944 at the Rastenburg Führerhauptquartier? 64[text00008.html#fn64]Howsoever one answers these questions, it is clear that the Madrid Circular isimplying that the Bomb Plot of 1944 was either a deliberately conceivedoperation from start to finish, or, if it was a genuine act of the Germanresistance, that it was used by the Nazi leadership as a crisis of opportunityto “execute” several perpetrators and provide a convenient cover for “newidentities” and usefulness to the postwar Nazi International after the end ofthe war.And either way one interprets it, one is left with the eau de Cologne de Bormannwafting through the air of the whole affair.C. Conclusions and IndicationsSo what are the indications of the Madrid Circular? How might one summarize itsbizarre and grandiose contents? What specific things must one look for to verifyits breathtaking assertions? When one piles it all up, one is left with thesepropositions:1)The idea for the creation of a “United Europe” was the brainchild both of Nazielites, and certain circles in Washington D.C., which parties had very differentmotivations for the creation of such a bloc:a)On the American side, the idea was advanced both as a bulwark against theSoviet bloc, and as a mechanism for the containment of German power and theprevention of a German hegemony in Europe;b)on the Nazi side, the idea was seen as an opportunity for Germany to achievesuch a European hegemony by political and economic, rather than military, means;2)For the Nazi International and its Madrid German Geopolitical Center, therestoration of German dominance of Europe was to be accomplished in three broadphases:a)In the short term to intermediate phase, a pro-Western orientation, duringwhich a variety of small “false front” organizations, including variouspolitical parties, would be used to advance basic Nazi and Fascist goals withinEurope, inclusive of the creation of the European federation itself;b)In the intermediary phase, the build-up of German and European ties withRussia, China, southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, with the goal ofexpanding German and European trade with those regions, and hence, building upEuropean, and particularly German, heavy industry and its military potential, ina Germano-European “pivot to Asia”;c)In the final phase, the covert cooption of the United States by an impliedcoup d’etat and engineered economic crises against “dollar diplomacy,” with aview to forcing a world-wide revolt against the USA in a kind of War of theLeague of Cambrai moment, and subsequently, after control over America isobtained, by utilizing American power for a final confrontation with the East ingeneral and Russia in particular;3)All of this was in turn to be achieved by relying upona)Nazi ties with the Muslim world to create destabilizing effects in theoil-rich Middle East, threatening the Anglo-American energy life-line, utilizingMuslim concepts such as jihad to do so; andb)German-American business contacts and relationships to challenge and overturnthe Morgenthau plan for the deindustrialization of postwar Germany and break upthe Anglo-American-Soviet wartime alliance and to exacerbate East-West tensionsin the Cold War, creating maneuvering room for Germany.If one looks at these three components and their sub-components, one has thetemplate and structure of the subsequent chapters of this book. Detailedexamination of each of them will thus tend to confirm and corroborate, orfalsify, the claims of the Madrid Circular.Unfortunately, it may be stated, here and now, that most if not all of itsgrandiose and sweeping assertions can be corroborated. But the devil—or in thiscase, the Nazi, and even sometimes Communist, devil—is in the details.1 [text00008.html#fn_1] Sergei Glazyev, “Putin’s Economic Advisor Warns WW3 HasBegun, States Russia Must Defeat US Nazism to Solve Ukranian Crisis!,”http://www.silverdoctors.com/putins-economic-advisor-warns-ww3-has-begun-states-russia-must-defeat-us-nazism-to-solve-ukranian-crisis/[http://www.silverdoctors.com/putins-economic-advisor-warns-ww3-has-begun-states-russia-must-defeat-us-nazism-to-solve-ukranian-crisis/]See also http://archive.larouchepac.com/node/31157[http://archive.larouchepac.com/node/31157] .

These observations prompt another: if one accepts, for thesake of argument, that there is indeed some hidden “fascist hand” in theformation of the European Union, then this factor would also impact the policyof Washington and Moscow. As I’ve observed in many numerous blogs and videos,the American base closures in Western Europe and deployment of troops eastwardinto former nations of the Warsaw Pact such as Poland and Romania may be aresponse to prevent the break of Western Europe from the Washington Axis as muchas it is a response to Russia. Such deployments allows easy US interdiction ofRussian energy supplies to Europe, as well as easy interdiction ofEuropean-Russian and European-Asian trade. The risk, however, is that it alsoplaces American military assets in the hot zone between the armed forces ofEurope and those of Russia, in the old post-Versailles cordon sanitaire of theBaltic States, Poland, and Romania.26 [text00008.html#fn_26] T.H. Tetens, Germany Plots with the Kremlin, p. 212.The Circular also notes that “Our present policy must be to overcome theconsequences of our previous mistakes. An emasculated Germany should never allowitself to be used as a spearhead in an attack against the Russian colossus. Thiswould be an insane act (Wahnsinnsexperiment) and would spell our final doom,whereas Germany as the exponent of European neutrality could gain far-reachingconcessions from the Soviets.” (p. 213) The obvious reference here is toHitler’s failed anti-Soviet campaign, Unternehmung Barbarossa (OperationBarbarossa). What few people realize, however, is that Adolf Hitler was actuallyon the verge both of military as well as political success in the early monthsof that campaign. Louis Kilzer,in his book Hitler’s Traitor: Martin Bormann andthe Defeat of the Reich, recalls the offer of peace that Stalin extended toHitler in September of 1941, in the wake of the crushing annihilation of thevast majority of the Red Army’s strength by the Wehrmacht in the opening weeksof the campaign:“On October 7, Stalin told (Marshal) Zhukov that Russia could not win the war.Secret negotiations between the two powers would begin on a compromise peace.Stalin was prepared from the start to cede the Baltic States, Byelorussia,Moldavia, and part of the Ukraine. Stalin, Beria, and Molotov called in theBulgarian ambassador to explain their offer and ask for Bulgaria to be theintermediary to the Führer. Only Molotov did any talking for the Soviet side.“Hitler had won. He could have his lebensraum. He would have all the resourceshe needed to prosecute the war. He would control the Baltic. If he accepted whatStalin offered, Britain would surely not be able to continue the war.“Why did Hitler not take victory? The whole truth may never be known. Ribbentropsaid that Hitler refused the offer, sent through King Boris of Bulgaria,‘because he was convinced he could stand the immediate test and emergevictorious in the end.’“In general, it appears that Hitler became a victim of his success.” (Kilzer,op. cit. pp. 109-110).27 [text00008.html#fn_27] T.H. Tetens, Germany Plots with the Kremlin, pp.212-213.28 [text00008.html#fn_28] Generaloberst, i.e., Colonel-General, the equivalentof a four star general. The German ranking system of that time until the end ofthe war was as follows: Generalmajor(1 star, the equivalent of an AmericanBrigadier General), Generalleutnant (2 stars, the equivalent of an AmericanMajor General), General der Kavalrie/Artillerie/Infanterie/Panzertruppe (3stars, the equivalent of an American Lieutenant General), Generaloberst (4stars, Colonel-General or equivalent of an American General),Generalfeld-marschal(Field Marshal, equivalent of General of the Army).29 [text00008.html#fn_29] In this respect, it is also worth noting that VonSeeckt was also ultimately responsible for the domestic spying program of theGerman Army on various right-wing and left-wing political groups, the very sameprogram that ultimately saw Adolf Hitler emplaced as one such spy to monitor thedoings of a young political party: the National Socialist Party.30 [text00008.html#fn_30] For this virtually unknown aspect of current Germannuclear capability, see Barbara Rogers and Zdenek Červenka, The Nuclear Axis:The Secret Collaboration Between West Germany and South Africa (New York: NewYork Times Books, 1978).31 [text00008.html#fn_31] T.H. Tetens, Germany Plots with the Kremlin, p. 213,emphasis added.32 [text00008.html#fn_32] T.H. Tetens, Germany Plots with the Kremlin, p. 214.33 [text00008.html#fn_33] The Circular also makes another interesting statementregarding the Korean War: “The motives for the American adventure in Korea arestill shrouded in mystery, but this much is known: Washington waited long for agood opportunity to put its economy on a war footing and to accelerate hermobilization with full speed. The effects of this step on world economy and itspolitical consequences become clearer and clearer day by day: in the course oftotal mobilization for war, not much will be left of ‘democracy.’” (Tetens, op.cit., p. 216) While the motivations may have been opaque at that time, as Iindicated in my first book dealing with an alternative history of the Naziperiod, Reich of the Black Sun, there is highly suggestive evidence that theatom bomb project of Imperial Japan, as well as Nazi Germany, was much furtheralong than the postwar Allied Legend would allow. As I indicated there, thisbomb program, according to the research of Robert Wilcox, was centered upon theChosin Reservoir in northern Korea, thus providing a hidden intelligence contextand agenda behind MacArthur’s Inchon landing and subsequent march into thenorth, and defeat at the Reservoir. The invasion, in other words, may have beenan attempt to (1) learn the exact state of Japanese nuclear research, and (2) toprevent that research from falling into the hands and benefitting the nuclearprograms of Mao’s China and Stalin’s Russia.34 [text00008.html#fn_34] T.H.

What is beingstated is merely that some of this resistance was a carefully coordinated masqueby the German oligarchy and Nazi elites.64 [text00008.html#fn_64] For this point, see the novel-spy thriller by CollinForbes, The Leader and The Damned. In the guise of fiction, Forbes presents thescenario that the bomb plot against Hitler in March of 1943, a very real plot,during which General Henning von Treschkow placed two bottles of wine that werein fact pressure activated bombs on Hitler’s plane, actually succeeded. Thisevent is dramatized in the opening of the Tom Cruise film Valkyrie, with vonTreschkow played by British actor Kenneth Brannaugh. In the Forbes scenario,Hitler had flown to Smolensk to discuss an audacious plan to move sixtydivisions from the West Wall – virtually stripping Europe of its Atlanticdefenses – for use in the summer 1943 offensive against the Kursk Salient, anoperation which, if completed, would have almost certainly have been successful.In Forbes’ scenario, the bombs exploded, Hitler was killed, and Bormann thensubstituted one of Hitler’s many doubles for the Führer, and conducted the restof the war himself. Forbes also strongly implies that Bormann was thestill-unknown Soviet mole within the headquarters of the O.K.W. (Oberkommandoder Wehrmacht). While I have never subscribed to this view, it does raiseinteresting possibilities if one considers that Bormann was not a Soviet mole,but that he did go on to escape the Bunker to make his way eventually to LatinAmerica, as I argued in The Nazi International (pp. 88-128). At the end of hisnovel, Forbes attaches an author’s epilogue, indicating that the novel was basedupon a story he had been told by a British intelligence insider after the war."},{"pageContent":"2THE FASCIST PHOENIX FROM ARYAN ASHES : THE BAD CHANCELLOR , THE CUNNING MINISTER, THE GOOD CHANCELLOR , AND THE CONTINUITY OF AN IDEA FROM BETTMANN -HOLLWEGTHROUGH RATHENAU TO ADENAUER“A year before that, at a press interview in Washington, the Chancellor’sprincipal diplomatic assistant, State Secretary Walter Hallstein, defined thearea to be liberated as reaching ‘up to the Ural Mountains.’” T.H.

Tetens 2[text00009.html#fn2]T HE IDEA OF A POLITICALLY, CULTURALLY, AND ECONOMICALLY UNITED EUROPE under astrong central authority is as old as the Roman Empire itself and,notwithstanding the ultimately disastrous reforms of the Emperor Diocletian,found its cultural and central authority expression, and even to some extent,its financial expression, in the Byzantine-Papal cultural domination of theMiddle Ages. Later still, it found political and economic expression in NapoleonBonaparte’s “continental system” of alliances and the economic bloc he attemptedto form from it, a system that ultimately led to his disastrous invasion ofRussia to enforce its stipulations, and to the final dissolution of French hopesto dominate a “United Europe.” Somewhat before that, during the earlyrevolutionary period, it also found expression of a sort in the plans and goalsof the Bavarian Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt to overturn all “princes andpriests” in an effort to return to the idea of a political simplicity (απλοτης),a “universal brotherhood of mankind” all under the illuminated Masonic guidanceof an international Pan-European technocratic elite, Weishaupt’s new elite, anelite which was, not surprisingly, dominated mostly by Germans. But nowhere didit find a more consistent expression and detailed planning than in the policiesof the German elites from the Kaiserreich of 1871-1918, through the Weimarperiod and throughout the entire era of the Nazi Third Reich, and down to ourown time. It is the consistency of this vision both in breadth, depth, anddetail that gives one pause, and it is therefore necessary to survey thathistory both as briefly and yet in as much detail as possible, both todemonstrate that consistency and to expose the underlying geopolitical visioninforming the Madrid Circular, for the reality of contemporary European powerpolitics is that like it or not, Germany’s is by far and away Europe’s largestsingle industrialized economy and population base, and every European powerknows this, and has known it since the modern united Germany first announceditself on the world stage at the proclamation of the German Empire at Versaillesin 1871 upon the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian War. It was then and remainsnow an uneasy symbiotic relationship between the rest of Europe, and its premierpower. 3 [text00009.html#fn3]In short, to understand the European Union, one simply must understand thehistory of the German visions for its creation, and their plans for dominatingit once it was formed. Indeed, the “hidden history”—though it really is not allthat hidden if one bothers to look carefully—of the two world wars is really thehistory of the struggle for its creation. As was noted at the end of theprevious chapter, the devils are always in the details, and in this case, thosecorporate and economic devils are very illuminating.A. The Bad Chancellor: Theobald von Bettmann-Hollweg1. And Germany’s First World War AimsTo some extent, the modern history and structure of the European Union begins inthe years immediately prior to World War One, and find their first fullestexpression in a statement of German War aims drawn up by the imperialReichskanzler of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Theobald von Bettmann-Hollweg, in theearliest days after the outbreak of World War One.001 [Image00003.gif]Theobald von Bettmann-Hollweg, 1856-1921, Reichskanzler from 1909-1917In September 1914, a mere month after World War One had begun in earnest, and inthe same time frame that Germany was to suffer defeat at the Battle of the Marnewhich would lead to four years of deadlocked trench warfare on the WesternFront, and mere days after the stunning German victory of Generals Ludendorffand Hindenburg at the Battle of Tannenberg on the Eastern Front, vonBettmann-Hollweg circulated a secret memorandum to the German industrial andmilitary elite in which he outlined what Germany’s war aims were. This becameknown as “the September Program,” and a mere glance at its provisions willdisclose not only how consistent its aims are with the Madrid Circular, but moreimportantly, how consistent its aims were with the contemporary realities ofEuropean Union power politics:1. France. The military to decide whether we should demand cession of Belfortand western slopes of the Vosges, razing of fortresses and cession of coastalstrip from Dunkirk to Boulogne.The ore-field of Briey, which is necessary for the supply of ore for ourindustry, to be ceded in any case.Further, a war indemnity, to be paid in instalments; it must be high enough toprevent France from spending any considerable sums on armaments in the next15-20 years.Furthermore: a commercial treaty which makes France economically dependent onGermany, secures the French market for our exports and makes it possible toexclude British commerce from France. This treaty must secure for us financialand industrial freedom of movement in France in such fashion that Germanenterprises can no longer receive different treatment from French.2. Belgium. Liége and Verviers to be attached to Prussia, a frontier strip ofthe province of Luxemburg to Luxemburg.Question whether Antwerp, with a corridor to Liége, should also be annexedremains open.At any rate, Belgium, even if allowed to continue to exist as a state, must bereduced to a vassal state, must allow us to occupy any militarily importantports, must place her coast at our disposal in military respects, must becomeeconomically a German province. Given such a solution, which offers theadvantages of annexation without its inescapable domestic politicaldisadvantages, French Flanders with Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne, where most ofthe population is Flemish, can without danger be attached to this unalteredBelgium. The competent quarters will have to judge the military value of thisposition against England.3. Luxemburg. Will become a German federal state and will receive a strip of thepresent Belgian province of Luxemburg and perhaps the corner of Longwy.4. We must create a central European economic association through common customstreaties, to includeFrance, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Austria-Hungary, Poland (sic), and perhapsItaly, Sweden, and Norway. This association will not have any commonconstitutional supreme authority and all its members will be formally equal, butin practice will be under German leadership and will stabilize Germany’seconomic dominance over Mittel-europa.5. The question of colonial acquisitions, where the first aim is the creation ofa continuous Central African colonial empire, will be considered later, as willthat of the aims to be realized vis-à-vis Russia.6. A short provisional formula for a possible preliminary peace to be found fora basis for the economic agreements to be concluded with France and Belgium.7. Holland. It will have to be considered by what means and methods Holland canbe brought into closer relationship with the German Empire.In view of the Dutch character, this closer relationship must leave them free ofany feeling of compulsion, must alter nothing in the Dutch war of life, and mustalso subject them to no new military obligations. Holland, then, must be leftindependent in externals, but be made internally dependent on us. Possible onemight consider an offensive and defensive alliance, to cover the colonies; inany case a customs association, perhaps the cession of Antwerp to Holland inreturn for the right to keep a German garrison in the fortress of Antwerp and atthe mouth of the Scheldt. 4 [text00009.html#fn4]Beyond the obvious facts that Bettmann-Hollweg intended to impose warreparations every bit as punitive to France as the Allies would eventuallyimpose on Germany in 1919 in the Versailles Treaty, and that he intended toannex various strategically important strips of France directly to theKaiserreich, what emerges as the central core of this document is somethingentirely different from direct military domination and territorial annexationsand, if one strips away the all the references to those annexations, somethingapparently “benign” emerges that begins to look like a familiar pattern:1)The document clearly advocates a “customs” union, i.e., a common economictrading zone comprising the bulk of western and central Europe, and Scandinavia;2)This customs union, lacking a unified central or, to employ Bettmann-Hollweg’sterminology, constitutional authority, will thus easily be dominated by Germanyas the de facto central authority;3)This customs union would be held together by a series of German garrisons andbases scattered throughout Europe as the “enforcement” of its policies.To put it as succinctly as possible, in spite of the popular image and even theAllied propaganda of the day, the German Empire was not seeking to “invade,conquer, and annex” whole swaths of European territory to the German Reich, butrather, to impose its idea of a “common market”—for in effect that is what acustoms union is—on the rest of Europe. It meant to dominate Europe politicallyby dominating it economically. The military aspect of World War One, as far asBettmann-Hollweg and other members of the German elite were concerned, wassimply “diplomacy by other means” to that very end, to cite the adage of vonClausewitz. And notably, in Bettmann-Hollweg’s version of the scheme, verylittle had changed since the time of Napoleon, for both men intended their“continental system” to be just that, a continental system excluding GreatBritain.Nor did von Bettmann-Hollweg simply dream these ideas up, whole cloth, under hisown inspiration and steam. Rather, they were deeply reflective of the strategic,political, and economic thinking of the German elite, including some in theGerman General Staff, in the years immediately prior to the war. For example,the industrialist Walther Rathenau, chief executive officer of the Germanelectrical giant, A.E.G. (Allgemeine Elekticitäts Gesellschaft), 5[text00009.html#fn5] proposed in a conversation with Bettmann-Hollweg in 1912“that German policy should be directed towards the creation of a centralEuropean customs union, and secured the Chancellor’s agreement.” 6[text00009.html#fn6] Rathenau followed this up in 1913 and again in 1914 withmemoranda outlining these policies as German war aims. 7 [text00009.html#fn7]Nor was Kaiser Wilhelm II opposed to such ideas. On the contrary, prior to thewar, to the very same Rathenau, Wilhelm outlined his own ideas “for an economicunification of the Continent as a defensive measure against the Americanreprisals policy of high tariffs.” 8 [text00009.html#fn8] In other words, evenbefore World War One, already the idea of a continental-wide system of economicintegration was being discussed—and by the Kaiser himself!—as a means ofcounter-balancing growing American power.2. Russia, and “Mitteleuropa”In 1912, Bettmann-Hollweg had just returned from a tour of Russia during whichthe idea of an economic union was fleshed out, not with respect to the growingpower of America, but rather, to that of Russia. The Chancellor…saw Russia’s “wealth of natural resources and of crude physical man-power” asthe bases for the development of “an expansive and gigantic industrial power”which might one day crush Germany. Germany could resist this power only byexpansion of her bases, which must include expansion to the west. Rathenau’sreport on the conversation, at the end of July, ran:“I developed my ideas: 1. Economics. Customs union with Austria, Switzerland,Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, etc., with simultaneous closer association. 2.Foreign Policy. Key to it: the Franco-German conflict, on which all nations growfat. Key: England. Disarmament impossible today. Begin by increasingtension—though dangerous—also undermine England’s position in Mediterranean.Then alliance. Object: Mittelafrika, Asia Minor. 9 [text00009.html#fn9]Behind all the cynical talk of individual nations, deliberate escalation oftensions with Great Britain, one discovers once again the same basic logic ofthe Madrid circular: faced with growing power to the West in the form of theUSA, and to the East in the form of Russia, the only ultimate way to preserveGerman power was via the creation of a continental economic bloc.In these ideas, Wilhelm II, Rathenau, and von Bettmann-Hollweg were echoing thethought and conceptions of one of the German General Staff’s chief geopoliticaland strategic theorists of the era, General Friedrich von Bernhardi, whose bookDeutschland und der nächste Krieg (Germany and the Next War) appeared in 1912and sold so heavily that it ran to five editions. 10 [text00009.html#fn10]German historian and scholar Fritz Fischer observers that the book “is generallydismissed by German historians as the eccentric outpourings of an undisciplinedPan-German with little relationship to the plans either of the general staff orof the government,” 11 [text00009.html#fn11] however, such is not the case atall. Rather, General von Bernhardi’s summary statement of his argument “underthe heading ‘World Power or Decline’ epitomized the intentions of officialGermany with great precision.” 12 [text00009.html#fn12]Indeed, von Bernhardi’s vision was hardly that of “an eccentric Pan-Germanist,”and they echo with astonishing foresight the underlying philosophy of the MadridCircular, for in the General’s long-term analysis of the geopolitical andeconomic situation,…three things were necessary for Germany’s advance to a position of world power:(i) The elimination of France (die Ausschaltung Frankreichs): France must be“completely brought to the ground, so that she shall never again be able toobstruct our path”—a formula which recurred almost verbatim in the SeptemberProgramme drawn up by Bettmann Hollweg a few weeks after the outbreak of war.(ii) Foundation of a Central European federation under German leadership.Bernhardi’s expectation that the smaller states (“the weaker neighbours”) wouldseek the protection of German arms and “attachment to Germany” was shared byleading circles in Germany during the war. The German government attemptedofficially, after 1914, to realise his demand for a “Mitteleuropa.” 13[text00009.html#fn13]And lest one think that the Wagnerian overtones of an apocalyptic struggleagainst the Slavic race that suffused the end-game speculations of the MadridCircular are missing from the more reasonable Wilhelmine military, von Bernhardimade it clear that his vision of a European Union was not merely political oreconomic in nature; it was an essential component in the Kulturkampf against theSlavic world that he envisioned, for the third component of his programenvisioned precisely this component:(iii) The development of Germany as a world power through the acquisition of newcolonies. Bernhardi agreed with the German professors, economists and politicalleaders in seeing the future no longer in terms of the old European system ofstates, but in a new system of world states, in which the balance depended onreal factors. But for him, as for them, world power was at the same time acultural mission. In the same December, 1912, in which the Emperor ordered thepsychological preparation of the nation, he instructed the Foreign Ministry thatthe recognition of the coming life and death struggle of the Teutons against theGauls and Slavs must be made “the basis of our policy”, and allies for it mustbe recruited wherever they could be found. “We must conclude a militaryagreement with Bulgaria…Turks, also with Rumania. We must also conclude such anagreement with Japan. Any power which can be got is good enough to help us.” 14[text00009.html#fn14]Thus, in 1912, one has not only the outlines of the post-World War Two MadridCircular, but also the outlines of the very Axis nations that would fight WorldWar Two.If all this sounds too uncomfortably like the world one sees emerging today,then consider that von Bernhardi was not merely one of an “eccentric group” of“Pan-Germanists,” but rather representative of the long-term strategic thinkingthat had begun to take hold not only of some Pan-Germanists but of the Germanelite itself, which began to court the idea “that they would need ‘Three PunicWars’ to destroy the British Empire and the United States.” 15[text00009.html#fn15] In March of 1918, they came very close to overwhelming theWestern Allies, and dealing the first of those mortal blows to the BritishEmpire.3. The Russian Surrender to the Central Powers: The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk anda Suggestive ComparisonThe story of this near success, and of its own unique role in the Nazi myth ofthe Dolchsto β in den Rücken, the “stab in the back” by internal “Jewishtraitors,” is well-known, but a quick review of it is in order. In 1917, theGerman General Staff, at the urging of the Kaiser’s close advisor, Max Warburgof the famous banking family, and with the consent of the then-virtual dictatorof Germany, General Erich Ludendorff, secretly transported a Russian Communistrevolutionary named Vladimir Ulyanov, known to the world as Lenin, on a Germantrain through German and Russian lines, for the express purpose of fomenting aCommunist revolution in Russia, and bringing down the Menshevik Socialistgovernment of Kerensky, which had overthrown the Tsar. “Coincidentally,” Lenin’sarrival in St. Petersburg was closely coordinated with that of Leon Trotsky, whowas traveling to Russia from his exile in the United States, suggesting to somethat this coordination was brokered by the Warburg family via banking contactsin neutral Sweden or Switzerland, with Max Warburg’s brother Paul, based in NewYork, coordinating the American end. 16 [text00009.html#fn16] In return for thisGerman assistance, the Bolsheviks pledged to take Russia out of the war, 17[text00009.html#fn17] releasing a million German troops for a final series ofoffensives on the Western front before American forces could arrive insufficient numbers to restore the balance of forces.As is now well known, the Bolshevik-Communist forces were successful inoverthrowing the Kerensky government, and immediately began negotiations withthe Central Powers to surrender. This was consummated at the Treaty ofBrest-Litovsk, signed on March 3, 1918 between Austria-Hungary, the OttomanEmpire, Bulgaria, the German Empire, and Russia. In it, Russia ceded the BalticStates to Germany, and renounced claims on Poland, Finland, Byelo-Russia, theUkraine, and portions of the Georgian Trans-Caucusus region, all of which wereto be occupied by the forces of Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, andGermany, as the following map demonstrates.001 [Image00004.gif]The Consequences of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, March 3, 1918:Russia’s small industrial base compared to that of Germany’s, meant that the warhad become essentially a slaughter, with little to no hope of a Russian victory.This fact, and the mounting casualties, gave rise to popular demands to end thewar, which the Bolsheviks exploited.Note the Gray areas of the Baltic States and the Ukraine, all of which wereoccupied by garrison forces of the Central Powers.In the Treaty, the German Empire had essentially articulated, and had recognizedin an international treaty instrument, its strategic aims as von Bernhardi andvon Bettmann-Hollweg had articulated them prior to the outbreak of the war, forthe Baltic states were to become German vassal states by the installation oflocal German nobility into their government, while a Polish, Byelo-Russian, andUkrainian state (the so-called Ukrainian Hetmanate) were to be puppet states ofBerlin and Vienna. What is important to remember in this context is that thelines and shaded areas on the map are much less important than the political andeconomic realities thereby indicated, for Germany’s intention was to dominatethese regions economically, and through this, politically. What one is reallylooking at, in other words, with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, are the firstplanks of Germany’s attempt to create its long-sought customs union, dominatingMitteleuropa.With this in mind, a comparison to the modern map of Europe is in order:001 [Image00005.jpg]Modern EuropeWith the dissolution of Austria-Hungary after World War One at the Treaty ofTrianon (1920), German economic domination of the smaller states of centralEurope—Bettmann-Hollweg’s and von Bernhardi’s Mitteleuropa —was assured. Andnow, as then, the Ukraine was the principal concern of the geopolitical andeconomic planners of Berlin.Ludendorff’s massive 1918 offensives in France, utilizing the transferred troopsfrom the Eastern Front, the new infiltration tactics perfected on the EasternFront, and the sudden, massive, sharp, short, and carefully coordinatedartillery bombardment tactics also perfected on the Eastern Front, 18[text00009.html#fn18] came perilously close to breaking the British and Frenchforces, exhausted by four years of warfare. Only the arrival of fresh Americantroops saved the Western Allies.The result was, of course, the abdication of the Kaiser, the German surrender,the Treaty of Versailles, the loss of German territories in the East, theimposition of sharp war reparations, severe limitations on German armaments andthe size of its military, the forbidding of any Anschluss or union of Austriaand Germany, and the “total war guilt clause” whereby Germany assumed completeresponsibility for starting World War One. For our purposes, we need to note twothings about the Versailles Treaty, one which is frequently commented upon, andone whose true purpose is seldom mentioned.The first of these, and the one most frequently commented upon, is therestriction of the German military, the Reichswehr, to an army of no more than100,000 men, an army that, moreover, was prohibited from manufacturing orpossessing any tanks, any artillery of larger than 15cm caliber (the Allies hadlearned the hard way!), or any combat aircraft, and to a small coastal defensenavy of ships no larger than 10,000 tons displacement. For a great power such asGermany, surrounded on all sides by powerful potential enemies such as France,Great Britain, the newly-founded Czechoslovakia (with its old Austrian imperialSkoda munitions works), and the Soviet Union, this was an obviously intolerablesituation, for it placed the ultimate security of the country in the hands ofthe very nations with whom it had recently been at war. Hence, this was one ofthe first series of provisions that would quickly begin to be circumvented afterthe war, as will be seen shortly. 19 [text00009.html#fn19]The second feature of the Versailles system whose true significance is notusually noticed is the provision prohibiting any union or Anschluss of Austriaand Germany. For the Allied geopoliticians in France in 1918-1919, the logic ofthis prohibition begins to be understood when one recalls that the German waraims were precisely to create a customs union in Europe, beginning withMitteleuropa, which reveals itself to be a euphemism for the German intention todominate its wartime ally, Austria-Hungary, economically and hence politically,transforming the Dual Monarchy into a vassal state. With the dissolution of theAustro-Hungarian Empire, however, the rump state of Austria could be more easilyabsorbed into the Reich. Additionally, such absorption would reverse thegeopolitical intention of the creation of Czechoslovakia, leaving that polyglotcountry surrounded on three sides by territories of an expanded Reich, and in anuntenable military position, exactly as happened after Hitler’s Anschluss ofAustria in 1938, which lead to the absorption of Bohemian Czechoslovakia and thecreation of the Slovakian rump and puppet state by Hitler in March 1939. Inshort, the prohibition of Anschluss was designed to thwart the first essentialstep in the creation of the German-dominated “customs union” of Mitteleuropa,which was, of course, the essential second step to the creation of aGerman-dominated “European Union.”B. The Cunning Minister: Walter Rathenaeu, Generaloberst Hans von Seekct, andthe Rapallo PrinzipWhile the above observations might at first seem to be a case of projection ofcontemporary realities into the past, the consistency of such goals and agendasover time, and through a variety of German governments and constitutionalarrangements, reveals its truthfulness, nowhere more so than during the ForeignMinistry of one of the interwar period’s most gifted statesmen: Walter Rathenau.001 [Image00006.gif]Reich Foreign Minister, Walter Rathenau, 1867-1922, Minister from Feb-June, 1922Rathenau was, like many other wealthy German Jews of the era, both a highlyliterate and intelligent man; opposed to the socialism of Soviet Russia and anynationalization of corporations, Rathenau was also a geopolitical and economicrealist who, like the vast majority of Germans, was also an ardent nationalistand opposed to the Versailles Treaty and its stipulations. Like many in thepolitical center of Germany at that time, he sought to create maneuvering roomfor Germany diplomatically, aiming always for the eventual overturning of thestipulations of Versailles.In 1922, as German Foreign Minister in the coalition government of CentristChancellor Josef Wirth, Rathenau, opposed though he was to Soviet methods andpolicies, had his opportunity with the Treaty of Rapallo, signed with theRussian Federated Socialist Republic. The terms of this treaty are instructive:The German Government, represented by Dr Walther Rathenau, Minister of State,and the Government of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, representedby M. Tchitcherin, People’s Commissary, have agreed upon the followingprovisions:Article 1The two Governments are agreed that the arrangements arrived at between theGerman Reich and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, with regard toquestions dating from the period of war between Germany and Russia, shall bedefinitely settled upon the following basis:[a] The German Reich and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic mutuallyagree to waive their claims for compensation for expenditure incurred on accountof the war, and also for war damages, that is to say, any damages which may havebeen suffered by them and by their nationals in war zones on account of militarymeasures, including all requisitions in enemy country. Both Parties likewiseagree to forgo compensation for any civilian damages, which may have beensuffered by the nationals of the one Party on account of so-called exceptionalwar measures or on account of emergency measures carried out by the other Party.[b] Legal relations in public and private matters arising out of the state ofwar, including the question of the treatment of trading vessels which havefallen into the hands of either Party, shall be settled on a basis ofreciprocity.[c] Germany and Russia mutually agree to waive their claims for compensation forexpenditure incurred by either party on behalf of prisoners of war. Furthermorethe German Government agrees to forgo compensation within(sic) regard to theexpenditure incurred by it on behalf of members of the Red Army interned inGermany. The Russian Government agrees to forgo the restitution of the proceedsof the sale carried out in Germany of the army stores brought into Germany bythe interned members of the Red Army mentioned above.Article 2Germany waives all claims against Russia which may have arisen through theapplication, up to the present, of the laws and measures of the RussianSocialist Federal Soviet Republic to German nationals or their private rightsand the rights of the German Reich and states, and also claims which may havearisen owing to any other measures taken by the Russian Socialist Federal SovietRepublic or by their agents against German nationals or the private rights, oncondition that the government of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republicdoes not satisfy claims for compensation of a similar nature made by a thirdParty.Article 3Diplomatic and consular relations between the German Reich and the RussianSocialist Federal Soviet Republic shall be resumed immediately. The conditionsfor the admission of the Consuls of both Parties shall be determined by means ofa special agreement.Article 4Both Governments have furthermore agreed that the establishment of the legalstatus of those nationals of the one Party, which live within the territory ofthe other Party, and the general regulation of mutual, commercial and economicrelations, shall be effected on the principle of the most favoured nation. Thisprinciple shall, however, not apply to the privileges and facilities which theRussian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic may grant to a Soviet Republic or toany State which in the past formed part of the former Russian Empire.Article 5The two Governments shall co-operate in a spirit of mutual goodwill in meetingthe economic needs of both countries. In the event of a fundamental settlementof the above question on an international basis, an exchange of opinions shallpreviously take place between the two Governments. The German Government, havinglately been informed of the proposed agreements of private firms, declares itsreadiness to give all possible support to these arrangements and to facilitatetheir being carried into effect.Article 6Articles 1[b] and 4 of this Agreement shall come into force on the day ofratification, and the remaining provisions shall come into force immediately.Original text done in duplicate at Rapallo on April 16, 1922Signed: RathenauSigned: Tchitcherin 20 [text00009.html#fn20]Note that the three principle effects of the Rapallo treaty are:1)The immediate restoration of diplomatic relations between (Soviet) Russia andGermany; thus, Germany becomes one of the first major nations to formallyrecognize the Soviet Union and government;2)Both countries forego any war indemnities or claims on the other, andrecognize the current status quo, i.e., Rapallo is the formal recognition byboth countries that the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk is no longer valid; 21[text00009.html#fn21] and finally and most importantly;3)Both countries agree to mutual economic assistance and cooperation on thebasis of most-favored nation trading status; in effect, the two major post-WorldWar One powers and pariah nations have agreed to cooperate and coordinate in alose economic bloc. This effectively made Weimar Germany the Soviet Union’sprincipal international trading partner, and vice versa.But there’s more.001 [Image00007.gif]Colonel-General (Generaloberst) Hans von Seeckt, 1855-1936, Chief of thepost-World War One Reichswehr, 1919-1926It has always been rumored that German Reichswehr chief, Colonel-General Hansvon Seeckt, secretly wrote to Rathenau and insisted on a secret protocol to theRapallo Treaty, authorizing the establishment of German armaments industries onRussian territory and facilities to train German officers and soldiers with thevery weapons—tanks, combat aircraft, heavy artillery—on Soviet soil at secrettraining centers, with weapons built in German factories in Russia, far from theprying eyes of the Allied military attaches combing factories in Germany for anysigns of armament production. In all likelihood, this is true, for although manyof von Seeckt’s papers and Soviet documents from the period have been destroyed,the reality confirms that some sort of secret arrangement did exist, andmoreover, existed from the early 1920s, during the Rapallo period:Rumors of a secret military supplement to the treaty soon spread. However, for along time the consensus was that those rumors were wrong, and that Soviet-Germanmilitary negotiations were independent of Rapallo and kept secret from theGerman Foreign Ministry for some time. This point of view was later challenged.On November 5, 1922, six other Soviet republics, which would soon become part ofthe Soviet Union, agreed to adhere to the Treaty of Rapallo as well.The Soviets offered Weimar Germany facilities deep inside the USSR for buildingand testing arms and for military training, well away from Treaty inspectors’eyes. In return, the Soviets asked for access to German technical developments,and for assistance in creating a Red Army General Staff.The first German officers went to the Soviet state for these purposes in March1922. One month later, Junkers began building aircraft at Fili, outside Moscow,in violation of Versailles. The great artillery manufacturer Krupp was soonactive in the south of the USSR, near Rostov-on-Don. In 1925, a flying schoolwas established at Vivupal, near Lipetsk, to train the first pilots for thefuture Luftwaffe. Since 1926, the Reichswehr had been able to use a tank schoolat Kazan (codenamed Kama) and a chemical weapons facility in Samara Oblast(codenamed Tomka). In turn, the Red Army gained access to these trainingfacilities, as well as military technology and theory from Weimar Germany. 22[text00009.html#fn22]In other words, in a little under half a decade after the signing of the Treatyof Versailles, and long before the advent of the Nazi regime, Weimar Germany hadcompletely circumvented the spirit of the Treaty of Versailles, if not itsletter, by embarking upon a covert rearmaments program in the very weaponsprohibited to it by employing a proxy state in which to do it, in return forwhich that state received the latest in industrial and military technology fromGermany. This pattern, the “Rapallo Prinzip” or Rapallo Principle, or RapalloTemplate, we shall see reflected again in the pattern of German behavior afterWorld War Two and down to our own day, and particularly with respect to nuclearand thermonuclear weapons.As for Colonel-General Hans von Seeckt, it is worth noting that during the FirstWorld War, he was chief of staff to one of that war’s greatest, if not mostcapable, field commanders, Field Marshal August von Mackensen, whoseability—almost unique for World War One commanders—was rapid maneuver warfare,combined with the artillery tactics reflected by his favorite artillerycommander, Col. Georg Bruchmüller! Von Seeckt carried these doctrines on intothe postwar Reichsheer, drilling it in all the newest tactics, and making it a“cadre” army, the finest in Europe, whose officers and non-commissioned officerswere all deliberately drilled to assume charge of units the next two sizeshigher than their standing rank normally commanded. When the Wehrmacht went towar in 1939, it was thus largely von Seeckt’s creation. 23 [text00009.html#fn23]001 [Image00008.gif]From the Bundesarchiv: Kaiser Wilhelm II in cape, with von Seeckt to his leftstanding at attention, and Field Marshal August von Mackensen in front of theguard, 1915C. The Good Chancellor: Dr. Konrad Adenauer and De- (or was that Re-?)NazificationFor reasons that will become apparent in a subsequent chapter, we leap over theNazi period to its very end, and to the very beginnings of the first post-WorldWar Two German government of German Federal Chancellor Dr. Konrad Adenauer(1876-1967).001 [Image00009.gif]The First Post-World War Two Chancellor: Dr. Konrad Adenauer (1876-1967),Bundeskanzler from 1949-19631. Nazi Documents from the End of the Second World WarIn 1953, and again in 1962, a Jewish German immigrant to the United States, T.H.Tetens (1899-1976) wrote two remarkable books detailing the existence andactivities of the postwar Nazi International, Germany Plots with the Kremlin(1953) and The New Germany and the Old Nazis (1962). Indeed, it is largelybecause of Tetens’ first book that anything is known about the Madrid Circularat all. The context in which Tetens did so, however, was that of a prolongedexamination of the activities of West Germany’s first postwar federalChancellor, Dr. Konrad Adenauer, and his government.Adenauer carefully cultivated his image as “the good Chancellor” for the benefitof the Western Allies, Great Britain, France, and the United States. But thereality, as Tetens observed, was very different, and there is no better place tobegin than with Adenauer’s attitudes and statements regarding the Germansurrender:On March 25, 1949, long before he was elected Chancellor, Dr. Adenauer causedconsternation among the Allies when he declared in a speech in Berne,Switzerland, that the German people had never surrendered to the Allies,implying that they were free from all obligations. The German military leaderswho surrendered in 1945 had “no mandate from the German people to submit to theterms of unconditional surrender.” In the same speech he opposed Alliedconfiscation of German patents and denounced the Oder-Neisse line 24[text00009.html#fn24] by declaring: “This frontier we shall never recognize!”The Chancellors’s official biographer notes that “Adenauer’s Berne speech causeda political sensation far beyond the frontiers of Switzerland; almost everywhereit was received with stormy indignation.” And at a mass meeting in Berlin in1950, Dr. Adenauer embarrassed the Allied representatives present when he ledthe crowd in the singing of “Deutschland ueber Alles,” which was played at hisrequest. 25 [text00009.html#fn25]What is interesting here is that Dr. Adenauer had pointed out the obvious,namely, that at the two German surrenders at Rheims, France, on May 7, 1945,signed by Colonel-General Alfred Jodl, and at Berlin on May 8, 1945, signed byrepresentatives of the three service branches of the German Wehrmacht, norepresentative signed on behalf of the government of the Third Reich itself, atthat time represented Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, nor on behalf of the Nazi Partyor its Party Chancery. 26 [text00009.html#fn26]This point raises in stark relief the issue of continuity between wartime andpostwar institutions and concepts in Germany. Here, there is an astonishingcontinuity between actual Nazi documents from the end of the war, and the MadridCircular five years later. For example, in a document classified GeheimeReichsache (Secret State Matter) dated March 15, 1944, the head of Germany’smilitary intelligence and counter-intelligence, the Abwehr, Admiral WilhelmCanaris, wrote that the immediate strategic goal had to be “to crush the enemy’splan whose object it is to destroy forever the German Reich militarily,economically, and culturally,” 27 [text00009.html#fn27] a clear reference to the“Morgenthau” plan which had been given approval by President Roosevelt, and withwhich we shall have much more to say in a subsequent chapter. Thus, a clear caseof continuity exists between wartime objectives of the Nazi elite at the end ofthe war, and the actual accomplishments claimed by the Madrid Circular fiveyears after its end, for the Morgenthau plan was indeed scuttled and neverimplemented. Moreover, in yet another point of continuity, Admiral Canaris alsostates that the means whereby this was to be accomplished was to utilize the“efficient contacts” which Germany had “at our command in the United States,” 28[text00009.html#fn28] a polite euphemism for the business contacts which existedprior to, and to some extent even during, the war.A word is also necessary about Admiral Wilhelm Canaris himself. Canaris wasimplicated in the July 1944 Bomb Plot against Hitler, and later executed.However, as was seen in the first chapter, the Madrid Circular explicitly raisesthe specter that the Bomb Plot was either a deliberate masquerade by the Nazis,or a crisis of opportunity that was seized in order to “execute” alleged“plotters”, and to create new identities for them. While absolutely no evidenceexists—to this author’s knowledge—to support the Madrid Circular’s contentionthat several plotters’ executions were staged, Canaris would have been a primecandidate for such a deception. 29 [text00009.html#fn29]001 [Image00010.gif]Admiral Wilhelm Franz Canaris, head of the AbwehrThe reason for this is that Canaris served during World War One as a Commanderwith Admiral Graf von Spee’s Far East Squadron. During the squadron’s dashacross the Pacific, down the western coast of South America, and through theStraits of Magellan, then Commander Canaris was detached from the squadron toscout coves and islands in the region that could serve as covert U-boat andother secret naval bases. It was Canaris’ scouting activities of these regionsduring the First World War, and his detailed personal knowledge of them, thatbecame crucial to the strategic evacuation plans of the Nazis in 1944-1945, asthese very regions were utilized by German and Italian ships and u-boats ingetting documents, money, and personnel into Tierra del Fuego and other placesin southern Argentina and Chile. If the Madrid Circular’s assertions in thisrespect are true, then Canaris would have been high on the list of “plotters” tobe “executed.” One does not search for postwar “war criminals” or high rankingNazi military officers if they are “dead.”001 [Image00011.gif]Admiral Canaris as a Commander with Admiral Graf von Spee’s Far East Squadronduring the First World WarEven earlier, in 1943, an American sympathizer, the geopolitician Dr. ColinRoss, working for the Nazi Foreign Ministry of Joachim von Ribbentrop, composeda memorandum on postwar psychological operations against the American people.Foreseeing the inevitable collapse that had already become evident in the wakeof the German defeat at Stalingrad, Ross advocated a prolonged campaign ofcarefully calculated psychological warfare against the U.S.A., 30[text00009.html#fn30] and the creation of…A far-flung organization in every country which, under enemy occupation, mustcarry on the task from the underground. We must do everything possible toimpress upon American public opinion that after the liberation of Europe theywill become involved in an endless maze of insoluble contradictions. Howevergreat their sacrifices may be they will end up in a blind alley exactly as ithappened in 1918 under Wilson’s grandiose planning. 31 [text00009.html#fn31]To put it differently, what von Ribbentrop’s Foreign Ministry experts wereadvocating was the creation of an extra-territorial State, the NaziInternational.As if this were not enough, in the final weeks of the war an even more grandioseplan was formulated. This plan was outlined in three documents recovered by theAllies, dated from April 3 to April 5, 1945, outlining what was called the“Generalplan 1945.” The second of these documents consists simply of theenumeration of twelve points under the heading “The European Peace-Order”. Aglance at these twelve points is highly instructive:1.Liberation of the German people from suppression and occupation.2.Repatriation of the expellees.3.An integrated German racial community.4.Elimination of all arbitrary acts by the enemy.5.European Union on a federalistic basis.6.Right to racial autonomy.7.European Common-weal.8.European Court of#Arbitration9.Community of related peoples with the final aim to create a Germanic Reich.10.Common-wealth between Germany and Bohemia and Moravia.11.Guaranteed protection of racial groups.12.Economic integration of Europe. 32 [text00009.html#fn32]If all this sounds familiar by now, it should, for a “common-wealth betweenGermany and Bohemia and Moravia” was in fact what von Bettmann-Hollweg and othermembers of the German elite advocated during World War One with their “customsunion” of Mitteleuropa, and it was in fact what was achieved with theestablishment of the Reichprotektorate Böhmen und Mahren (Reich Protectorate ofBohemia and Moravia) in 1939, and, some would argue, it was again what wasachieved after German reunification when the Kohl government exerted enormouspressure on Czechoslovakia, once again breaking the country up into itsBohemian-Moravian, and Slovakian components, just as was done in 1939. 33[text00009.html#fn33] As for the rest—a European federation, European court, andEuropean economic integration—those too are accomplished facts. Of course, allof this may just be easy and convenient coincidence, but again, the Nazi devilsare in the details, as will be seen in chapter four.Finally, perhaps most importantly, the third of these documents, “Annex toGeneral Plan 1945,” dated April 5, 1945, and titled “The Overcoming of theCatastrophe,” recommends an interesting course of action, a course of actionreflected in the Madrid Circular. Recognizing that “practically nothing can beoffered to the Western Powers,” 34 [text00009.html#fn34] the document goes on tooutline seven specific steps that can be undertaken with Soviet Russia in along-term postwar orientation of Germany’s interests eastward:a)Germany and the present Soviet Union join together in creating a “SocialistUnion.” Tying in with the independence of the sixteen Soviet Republics in 1943,the European peoples form nationally defined, self-governing states, alliedthrough a defense and economic union. Internal forms within the states are to bedecided by the people.b)Germany recognizes the Soviet Republics of Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia,Finland, Bulgaria, Rumania, Macedonia, Greece, and perhaps Turkey.c)The Western part of Upper Silesia and all the parts of the Warthegau andWestern Prussia which were parts of Prussia until 1918 remain German territory.Furthermore, Germany gets a stronger influence in Old Bohemia and in theSouth-East.d)Mutual exchange of prisoners of war and civilians including all the deportedGermans from Transylvania, Banat, Pommerania, Silesia, East Prussia, etc.e)Germany gets a free hand in northern and Western Europe, especially againstGreat Britain.f)The whole “Socialistic Union’ supports Germany, especially through deliveriesof raw materials.g)Germany supports Soviet Russia in the reconstruction of the war-devastatedareas.The document goes on to draw this conclusion should the above courses of actionprove successful:A colossal bloc of world-dominating greatness, economic power, energy andnumbers of population would be created from ocean to ocean. 35[text00009.html#fn35]Beyond those concerns of the immediate moment, such as exchange of prisoners ofwar, re-settlement of Germans into the eastern provinces of Germany, and so on,what emerges from this document is, again, a stunningly prescient forecast ofwhat actually happened, not only in the formation of the NATO alliance for“common defense,” not only in the formation of the European economic community,but also with respect to the relationship that has increasingly maintainedbetween Germany and Russia since the end of the war, and even more so since thecollapse of the Warsaw Pact and German reunification: Germany is supported by“deliveries of raw materials,” especially in the form of energy, from theRussian Federation. This eastward pro-Russian pivot, or Ostpolitik, advocated asthe mid-term strategic goal in the Madrid Circular, thus finds expression in anofficial Nazi document from the end of the war. And as will be seen in a futurechapter, the two countries’ goals of a federation from “the Atlantic to theUrals” in Germany’s case, or of a federation from “the Atlantic to Vladivostok”in Russia’s case, are not all that different from each other.But what has all this to do with Germany’s first postwar Chancellor? In a word,everything, and there is no better place to begin than with an event that isvirtually forgotten today, the attempted “Naumann Coup” against the Chancellorand his government in 1953. Were it not for the chronicling efforts of T.H.Tetens, the incident probably would have been forgotten altogether.2. The Naumann Coup Attempt and Its ImplicationsOn the morning of January 15, 1953, shortly after seven A.M., the head of theBritish Foreign Office’s press unit, Sir William Ridsdale, handed out anofficial press release which stated that Chancellor Konrad Adenauer’s governmenthad arrestedA group of seven former high Nazis officials…in Duesseldorf and Hamburg forhaving plotted the overthrow of the Bonn Republic. The official announcementsaid that the British authorities had been aware for some time that the sevenmen had been involved in a plot and that the arrest had been made under theauthority of (British) Foreign Minister (Anthony) Eden. 36 [text00009.html#fn36]These were not just any ordinary group of seven men with delusions of grandeur,but rather, high-ranking Nazis within the Third Reich. The coup’s ringleader wasone Dr. Werner Naumann, whoHad served as State Secretary in Dr. Goebbels’ Propaganda Ministry. Dr. Naumannhad been with Hitler during the very last days in the bunker of the Chancelleryin Berlin, and he was the one designated by the Fuehrer in his testament tosucceed Dr. Goebbels as Propaganda Minister. 37 [text00009.html#fn37]Naumann’s co-conspirators were a Who’s Who of regional Nazi leaders in Hitler’sThird Reich:1)Karl Kaufmann, the former Gauleiter (Nazi party district leader) of Hamburg;2)Paul Zimmermann, a former general in the SS and a high official in the SS’concentration camp organization;3)Gustav Scheel, Gauleiter of Salzburg and “designated Ministerer of Educationin Hitler’s will”; 38 [text00009.html#fn38]4)Dr, Heinrich Haselmeyer, chief of the Nazi party’s “Student League” Hitler’s“expert on race and sterilization”; 39 [text00009.html#fn39]5)Dr. Karl Scharping, another official in Dr. Goebbels’ Propaganda Ministry; andfinally,6)Heinz Seipen, yet another Gauleiter. 40 [text00009.html#fn40]Nor was this all. The British communique indicated that the seven arrested menwere merely the tip of a much larger iceberg, for they “were described as theleaders of a group of a hundred twenty-five important Nazis whose aim was toinfiltrate the three Rightist parties in the Adenauer coalition. Their finalgoal had been ‘the overthrow of the Bonn parliamentary regime.’” 41[text00009.html#fn41] Additionally, the British also indicated that the plot washatched by the postwar Nazi International’s network, which spread “fromDuesseldorff to Cairo, Madrid, Buenos Aires, and Malmö, Sweden.” 42[text00009.html#fn42] One might expect that Konrad Adenauer’s government wouldhave been grateful to the British for exposing and halting the very coup attemptthat would have unseated him.3. Adenauer’s Nazisa. The Official Version of Adenauer’s ResponseHowever, this was far from the case. The “official” reason given for ChancellorAdenauer’s chilly response to the British exposure of the plot was political:At that time the Adenauer cabinet hoped for a speedy ratification of theEuropean Defense Community Treaty (EDC) which would restore full Germansovereignty and would be the first step toward political unification of Europe.To raise the specter of a resurgent Nazi danger before world public opinion atsuch a moment was, in Dr. Adenauer’s eyes, an unpardonable crime. The Chancellorwas especially bitter because the British High Commissioner, Sir IvoneKirkpatrick, had not consulted him before the arrest. 43 [text00009.html#fn43]For the Adenauer Government, the European Defense Community Treaty was the meanswhereby Germany would be allowed to be rearmed, in addition to being a steppingstone on the way toward a political unification of Europe. It is significantthat Great Britain, skeptical of the efforts toward European political unionright up to the end of the Thatcher era, chose this precise moment to embarrassAdenauer. 44 [text00009.html#fn44]This was just the beginning for the Adenauer Government, and for our purposes,it is the beginning of a problematic that will reveal itself as the story asoutlined by Tetens proceeds, for after the British finally convinced Adenauerand his cabinet that the evidence against Naumann and his associates wasoverwhelming, Bonn succeeded in convincing the British to hand the plotters overto German jurisdiction for trial. The British handed the plotters over to theAdenauer Government on March 26, 1953. 45 [text00009.html#fn45]At this juncture, the Bonn government issued a flurry of statements. Even Dr.Adenauer “admitted at a press conference ‘the existence of a far-flung plot’ andthat Naumann’s activities ‘had been financed with considerable sums by Nazigroups in foreign countries,’” 46 [text00009.html#fn46] while his justiceminister went further by acknowledging that the Naumann circle of Nazis haddevised:…“A most cunning and diabolical system of infiltration,” and that the conspiracyrepresented “an acute threat to the democratic institutions of the Federalrepublic.” The captured Nauman documents, he said, “gave clear proof that theaim of the group had been to fill key positions in all Rightist parties withhard-core Nazis and thereby create propaganda vehicles which could later be usedfor a broad neo-Nazis mass movement.” 47 [text00009.html#fn47]In spite of these public statements of shock and outrage, however, the actualtreatment of the Naumann conspirators by the Adenauer Government, once they werein German jurisdiction, was quite contrary to the expressions of public shock,for at the end of June, 1953, all the conspirators were released, and byDecember 1954, the German Supreme Court “dismissed the case without any trial orhearing.” 48 [text00009.html#fn48] . It should be noted that, according toTetens, the German media was less than impressed with Adenauer’s performance inthe whole affair, with the Frankfurter Rundschau publishing much of thedocumentation and details of the plot in articles from January and February, andagain in June 1953. 49 [text00009.html#fn49]The plot as exposed by the Frankfurter Rundschau was revealing, and encompassedfour main methodological points by which the postwar Nazi International intendedto operate within Germany:1)The democratic institutions of the new Bonn Federal Republic of Germany wouldbe used “as a fa÷ade behind which a new Nazi movement could be organized;” 50[text00009.html#fn50]2)Chancellor Adenauer was to be used as a front, or a shill, for the NaziInternational’s objectives, so as not to raise undue suspicion;3)A “new method of infiltration” was to be developed to penetrate the existingpolitical parties of Germany “in order to conquer the existing political partiesand the administrative machinery of the state from within” while deliberatelyand scrupulously avoiding ostentatious displays of nationalism; 51[text00009.html#fn51] and finally,4)Promote people trained prior to and during the war in the Hitler Youth intopositions of power and influence, “not only in the Adenauer coalition partiesbut also into all other political organizations.” 52 [text00009.html#fn52]The careful reader will now have noticed the first appearance of the problematicsurrounding the Naumann plot, its subsequent exposure by the British, and itscharacterization by the Adenauer government, for if these were the favoredmethodologies of the Naumann circle, why would they risk a carefully plannedlong-term strategy by an attempted coup against the very government it wastrying to infiltrate? As will be seen in the next section, this is not the onlymanifestation of this problematic.b. Adenauer’s Nazis(1) The British White Paper on the Nazi InternationalBy August 1953, the British had prepared their own statements on the Naumanncoup attempt plot in “a lengthy white paper.” This paper was suddenly andinexplicably withdrawn from publication at the last minute for “reasons whichhave never been made quite clear.” 53 [text00009.html#fn53] As Tetens notes,however, rumors ascribed the withdrawal to political pressure from Washingtonand Bonn. 54 [text00009.html#fn54] Could such pressure have been brought tobear?It is indeed possible, for consider only that Dr. Adenauer’s intelligence chiefat this time, and throughout his and the governments of his successors LudwigErhardt and Kurt Georg Kiesinger, was none other than General Reinhard Gehlen,chief of the wartime Nazi military intelligence organization Fremde Heere Ost(Foreign Armies East), who had deep contacts with American intelligence and thepro-German business interests represented by his acquaintance with Allen Dullesof the CIA.(2) A Couple of Nazis in Adenauer’s CourtIt is when one considers Adenauer’s government itself, however, that theproblematic posed by the Naumann coup become most acute. For example, Dr. HansGlobke was the actual director of the Bundeskanzlei (Federal Chancellory) inBonn, and one of Adenauer’s chief national security advisors, until his pro-Nazipast caught up with him, and he resigned all government posts in 1963.While never formally a member of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party,he did file an application for membership, and conveniently neglected to informthe judges of the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunals that he had done so. 55[text00009.html#fn55] Globke additionally held high position within the ThirdReich, being the head of the Office for Jewish Affairs in the Interior Ministry,which was the office responsible for drafting the notorious 1935 Nuremberg racelaws. 56 [text00009.html#fn56] But while it was Interior Minister Wilhelm Frickwho was sentenced to hang by the Nuremberg Tribunal, it was Globke “who draftedthe text of Hitler’s race law and who wrote the notorious ‘Commentary’interpreting this Nuremberg law, which paved the way for the extermination ofmillions of human beings.” 57 [text00009.html#fn57] Moreover, in his capacity inthe Nazi Interior Ministry, Globke worked closed with Adolf Eichmann and othersin the implementation of the “Final Solution,” and at one point, his personalintervention sealed the fate and murder of some 20,000 Jews, and received apersonal commendation from Frick for his role in drafting the law. 58[text00009.html#fn58]Moreover, within Adenauer’s Government, Globke occupied the key post ofSecretary of State, which within the German parliamentary system, meant thatGlobke, so to speak, was to Adenauer what Martin Bormann was to Hitler: he wasthe man who convened meetings of the federal cabinet, determined its agendas,and decided what mail and other documents that Chancellor Adenauer saw. 59[text00009.html#fn59] He was Adenauer’s gatekeeper. This meant that not only wasGlobke “the hub of the entire government machinery,” but that he was theimmediate superior to Adenaur’s espionage chief, General Reinhard Gehlen, whoseorganization, notes Tetens, had by 1950 grown to a staff three thousand, with anespionage network from “Korea to Cairo, from Siberia to Sntiago de Chile.” 60[text00009.html#fn60] Add to this that the entire West German Federal Pressoffice also fell under Dr. Globke’s control, and that Dr. Globke exercisedcontrol over the Chancellor’s discretionary fund 61 [text00009.html#fn61] —afund with over 40,000,000 marks in it—and one had a very powerful man, of verydubious background, in a position of authority without any parallel save perhapsthe Chancellorship itself.But Globke was not the only member of the Adenauer government with a pro-Nazibackground. Dr. Gustav Sonnonhol had become a member of the notoriousBrownshirts, the Sturmabteilung or S.A., and a Nazi Party member in 1930.Subsequently he was attached to the staff of Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim vonRibbentrop as an SS officer.This Nazi record was no hindrance to the old fighter who, in 1950, was appointedhead of the Information Office for Marshall Plan Air in the Adenaueradministration. A few years later Dr. Sonnenhol became the senior advisor toVice-Chancellor Bluecher in the second Adenauer cabinet. 62[text00009.html#fn62]It was in this position as advisor to the Vice-Chancellor that Sonnenhol, in amemorandum, argued that the Federal Republic should “exploit the cold war andmake sure that no agreement should be reached between the United States and theSoviet bloc.” 63 [text00009.html#fn63] In other words, Sonnenhol advocated aposition similar to the Madrid Circular. And as for his position as chief of theMarshal Plan Aid Information Office, this would seem to corroborate to a smalldegree the speculation I have advanced elsewhere, namely, that the earlyBilderberg meetings were established for the secret purpose of being thecoordinating body behind the movement of Axis loot into the Western bankingsystem, in order to launder part of those funds back to Europe in the form ofAmerican aid. 64 [text00009.html#fn64]These were not unique patterns in Adenauer’s governments, and to a certainextent, it may be said that Adenauer’s Christian Democratic Union party—theparty of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Chancellorin Angela Merkel—was the vehicleby which some former Nazis and pro-Nazis were “mainstreamed” in the postwaryears. 65 [text00009.html#fn65] Indeed, Adenauer was not above conspiring withknown Nazis and Nazi organizations, as a secret meeting was attended by Nazileaders in response to an invitation from Adenauer. Der Spiegel broke the storyof the meeting—brokered by former SS officer Carl Cerff—on February 6, 1957. Thepurpose of the meeting? To ensure the support of the radical right for Adenauerin the 1957 elections. 66 [text00009.html#fn66](3) Adenauer, the Nazi International, and the Problematic of the Naumann CoupAttemptSo what was Adenauer’s relationship, if any, to the German Geopolitical Centerin Madrid, and to the wider Nazi International? The public face of this centeris well-known, having been represented by the former Propaganda Ministryofficial Dr. Johann von Leers, 67 [text00009.html#fn67] Luftwaffe ace pilot HansUlrich Rudel, and most especially by former SS Lt. Col., and Hitler’s “favoritecommando,” Otto Skorzeny. 68 [text00009.html#fn68] It was, however, in theoverthrow of Egyptian King Farouk and end of British and French influence inEgypt during the Suez crisis of 1954 that the influence of this NaziInternational organization on Adenauer’s government was most evident, since itwas the presence of key Nazi officials in Egypt, including von Leers, thatworked directly with Bonn’s Foreign Ministry. 69 [text00009.html#fn69] Indeed,as Tetens complained, and as we have seen abundant evidence of, “Dr. Adenauer’swhole timetable in dealing with the Western powers has been carefully preparedby those ‘irresponsible Haushofer-Ribbentrop disciples who, from Madrid andBuenos Aires, regularly gave directives to their former Nazi colleagues in theBonn Foreign Office.” 70 [text00009.html#fn70]All of this highlights in stark relief the difficulty posed by the Naumann coupplot, for under Allied occupation, any open coup attempt to restore Nazis topower was not only fraught with risk, but, should it have been successful intoppling the Adenauer government, would have been quickly crushed by British,French, and American occupation forces. In other words, any coup attempt wasdoomed, and the plotters have to have known this. So why attempt to plan such acoup at all?These considerations strongly suggest that the coup attempt may have been acarefully planned operation deliberately designed to fail in order to make theAdenauer government and its goals look moderate. In other words, one has aclassic case of dialectical planning, with the external Communist threat thethesis, the internal Nazi threat, represented by Naumann and his plotters theantithesis, and Adenauer and his Government representing the “moderate,centrist” synthesis.(4) Adenauer’s Foreign Policy: “The Third Way,” the “Third Force,” and a UnitedEuropeSuch long-term dialectical planning is even more strongly in evidence inAdenauer’s foreign policy, which looks not only like a copy of the MadridCircular, but which also incorporates the key geopolitical agendas of the Germanoligarchy back to the days of Chancellor Theobald von Bettmann-Hollweg. Suchplans bring one chin-to-chin with German, and American, postwar plans for aUnited Europe.For our purposes, however, we must concentrate on the German aspect of thishistory, for like contemporary—and pro-Nazi—Argentinian dictator Juan Peron, Dr.Adenauer was a strong advocate for a “Third Way,” i.e., the creation of apolitical-military-and economic-bloc centered on Europe as an alternativebetween the capitalism of the American-led west, and the Communism of theSoviet-led East. Adenauer himself, in 1950, wrote in an editorial in theRheinischer Merkur:A federated Europe will become a Third Force in the world, not as strong asRussia or the United States, but powerful enough to intervene successfully—in adecisive moment—to safeguard the peace…Germany has again become a factor withwhom others will have to reckon in international affairs…There is also along-range economic goal: the colonization of Africa…If we Europeans colonizeAfrica, we create at the same time a supplier of raw materials for Europe whichwill be of the greatest importance. 71 [text00009.html#fn71]Nor was Adenauer alone in expressing such sentiments in the postwar Germanmedia, which was itself a fleshpot of personnel who had been carefullyinfiltrated into it from Ribbentrop’s Nazi Foreign Ministry and Dr. JosefGöbbels’ Propaganda Ministry. 72 [text00009.html#fn72]For example, on November 1, 1951, the pro-Adenauer magazine Christ und Weltpublished an editorial advocated a strong integrated Europe with “its own strongmilitary arm” able to arbitrate, or to be the decisive weight, in anyconfrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. 73[text00009.html#fn73] Later, on December 27, 1951, the same Christ und Weltmagazine wrote again of a united Europe as a “third power,” this time even moreprophetically:It would first be necessary that we first create a united, healthy, and strongWestern Europe in whose name the following offer to the Kremlin could then bemade: Continental Europe would break away from the Atlantic Pact if the Sovietsagree to withdraw their forces behind the Pripet-Marshes and release not onlythe Eastern zone of Germany, but the whole of Eastern Europe into the EuropeanUnion. A United Europe, standing on its own feet and possessing its own powerfularmy.…Could afford to carry out such an independent policy because it will havethe strength of a third power. 74 [text00009.html#fn74]As will eventually be seen, such an offer indeed may have been secretly made,and agreed upon, during the German reunification, between the Government ofChristian Democrat Helmut Kohl, and the Yeltsin Government of post-SovietRussia. And as is abundantly evident, the “break-up” of the Soviet Union didindeed result in the withdrawal of Russian forces behind the Pripet Marshes, andthe joining of the former Warsaw Pact countries—the Baltic States, Poland, theCzech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Hungary, Romania and so on—to the EuropeanUnion. 75 [text00009.html#fn75]Such goals are, of course, entirely consistent with those of the MadridCircular, and are another indicator that the influence of the postwar NaziInternational within Adenauer’s government was quite palpable, if not directlyvisible by the presence of such people as Globke and Gehlen in his government,for the goal of a united Europe is clearly implicated in the Circular. 76[text00009.html#fn76]Lest it be forgotten, Adenauer was also an advocate of the policy of the“rollback” of the Soviet bloc, nation-by-nation, a policy advocated by GeneralGehlen, whose network included cells of nationalist guerillas within the Sovietbloc in the Ukraine, Byelo-Russia, and the Baltic states, ready to be activatedwhen the time was right, a policy which found its echo in postwar Americanplanning in the hands of such people as George Kennan. Nor was Adenauer and hisministers vague about their ultimate aims:The day after his election victory in 1953, the Chancellor, in a fiery speech inBonn, demanded the Befreiung 77 [text00009.html#fn77] of the territories in theEast: “But instead of reunification, let us talk rather of liberation(Befreiung) —the liberation of our brethren in slavery in the East. That is ouraim, and that we shall achieve, but only with outside help.”A year before that, at a press interview in Washington, the Chancellor’sprincipal diplomatic assistant, State Secretary Walter Hallstein, defined thearea to be liberated as reaching “up to the Ural Mountains.” 78[text00009.html#fn78]To put it differently, the united Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals of whichthe German oligarchs dreamt under the Nazis 79 [text00009.html#fn79] isprecisely the same Europe dreamt of by Adenauer and his highest ministers,including Walter Hallstein, an important figure, whom we shall encounter againin a subsequent chapter.The key, so far as the consistent policy of the German oligarchy was concerned,was the attempt to dominate Europe through cartel arrangements and agreements.Already in the period between World Wars One and Two, two powerful cartels,Fritz Thyssen’s Vereinigte Stahlwerke (United Steel Works), 80[text00009.html#fn80] and of course the immensely powerful and notoriousInteressen Gemeinschaft Farbenindustrie Aktiens Gesellschaft, I.G. Farben, A.G.,were formed. This methodology, cartelization—whether de jure or de facto —willbecome a crucial point of consideration as well in coming pages.Enter the Schumann plan to coordinate coal and steel production in a “commonmarket” or customs union. Brainchild of French Foreign Minister Robert Schumann,the plan created in 1950 the European Coal and Steel Community, the first plankon the way to the later Common Market, and even later, the European Union.Effectively, the plan was a cartel arrangement, whereby the French hoped to beable “to limit German industrial production,” an attempt that Tetens predictedwould “turn out to be an illusion,” 81 [text00009.html#fn81] and which indeedhas proven to be an illusion. For the Americans, a united Europe in whichGermany played “the leading role” was a means to check German power, and toexercise even greater influence, through Germany, over Europe. 82[text00009.html#fn82] But for the German leadership, as has been seen, a unitedEurope was simply the mechanism by which to exercise world power.It is illuminating to see how Tetens, writing in 1953, formulated the long-termstrategic goals of the German oligarchy, for again, his words are indeedprophetic:The German scheme of changing defeat into victory envisages the following steps:After the establishment of a German-dominated Europe, a close tie-up will followwith…Latin America. At the same time, the big German industrial combines willinitiate an ambitious plan for the economic exploitation of Africa for whichthey expect great financial support from the United States. Having gained afoothold in Africa, Germany will create close relations with the nationalisticUnion of South Africa, and at the same time will buttress her friendship withthe whole pan-Arabic world. Of course, that scheme can only be carried out afterGermany will have established friendly political relations with Russia. Theagreement with Russia will also open the door to a very profitable trade withChina and South-East Asia. 83 [text00009.html#fn83]It is therefore no coincidence that in one of postwar West Germany’s first“economic and military breakout” attempts, that the Adenauer Governmentparticipated in the USA’s scheme to create an eight billion dollar Africaneconomic development plan by establishing the Deutscher Arbeitstab Afrika (TheGerman Planning Staff Africa). 84 [text00009.html#fn84]But the creation of the Deutscher Arbeitstab Afrika was just the beginning of amuch more sinister scheme, one in which one discovers the Rapallo Template orRapallo Prinzip in full flower…1 [text00009.html#fn_1] T.H.

The rumble was so loudthat it could be heard in London. The chief architect of these diabolicalfirestorms was Colonel Georg Bruchmüller, whose method of coordinating artilleryand maneuver differed greatly from the Allied doctrine. It may be said withoutany exaggeration that Bruchmüller essentially invented the modern doctrines ofartillery usage.19 [text00009.html#fn_19] The case of Czechoslovakia is particularlyillustrative of how the Versailles system attempted to hedge in German power,for what had once been a friendly region, with its own military technologicalcapability in the form of Austrian Bohemia (with its Skoda works), was suddenlyand almost instantly transformed into what Nazi propaganda, without muchexaggeration, qualified as a “dagger pointed at the heart of the Reich.” Notsurprisingly, the dismemberment and dissolution of Czechoslovakia thereforebecame a goal of post-World War One German policy almost as soon as the ink wasdry on the Versailles Treaty. Nor should the consistency of this goal beoverlooked, for as I detailed in The Nazi International, this was also a goal ofChancellor Kohl’s foreign policy shortly after the reunification of Germany.(See my Nazi International, pp. 232-234)20 [text00009.html#fn_20] “Treaty of Rapallo,”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rapallo_%281922%29[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rapallo_%281922%29] , emphasis added.21 [text00009.html#fn_21] In terms of law, Imperial Germany, by signing theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Soviet representatives, had formally recognizedthe Soviet Union.

This line was consistently renounced by West Germangovernments until the beginnings of the government of Willi Brandt, when itbegan to become a negotiable matter. As I detailed in The Nazi International,after the German reunification, under the Kohl Government, German economicpressure began to exert itself in these provinces, as Germans moved into Polandand began buying up old “family lands.” In response, the Kohl Governmentdemanded that Germans in these territories be granted dual citizenship status.(See The Nazi International, pp. 234-236).25 [text00009.html#fn_25] T.H.

It should be mentioned that themeaning of the controversial verses of the German national anthem, composed inthe revolutionary fervor of the 19th century, is not what most people think. Theverses, composed by August Hoffmann, were meant to emphasize the goal of aunited German nation, which, when they were composed in the mid-19th century,Germany was not. The first verse of the anthem only took on its associationswith German militarism and conquest as a result largely of World War Two. Theopening verse of the anthem indicates why, however, it would be highlycontroversial for Dr. Adenauer to have led in its singing:Deutschland, Deutschland über alles,Über alles in der Welt,Wenn es stets zu Schutz und TrutzeBrüderlich zusammenhält,Von der Maas bis an die Memel,Von der Etsch bis an den Belt,Deutschland, Deutschland über alles,Über alles in der Welt.Germany, Germany above all,Above everything in the world,When, for protection and defense,It always stands brotherly together.From the Meuse to the Memel,From the Adige, to the BeltGermany, Germany, above all,Above everything in the world.Obviously, a postwar contender for Chancellor singing about German unity fromthe Meuse River – inside Belgium and France – to the Memel territory ofLithuania, would be bound to cause political friction.26 [text00009.html#fn_26] See my The Nazi International, pp. 1-12.27 [text00009.html#fn_27] T.H.

Thissuggests, as I have argued in various public blogs, that American actions mightbe viewed not only as anti-Russian, but as preventative measures to insure itscontinuing dominance of Western Europe, and the prevention of a more independentGerman and European policy.76 [text00009.html#fn_76] Tetens, Germany Plots with the Kremlin, p. 77.77 [text00009.html#fn_77] Befreiung, i.e., liberation.78 [text00009.html#fn_78] T.H.

These weapons—tanks, aircraft, heavy artillery—were thentested by the German military inside the Soviet Union in secret militarycooperation agreements with that nation. In this arrangement, one may detect twoprinciples in operation that, greatly expanded upon the international stage,would become the operative watchwords for postwar Germany, and the group of Nazior pro-Nazi individuals that drove its policy:1)Both Germany and the Soviet Union were, after World War One, pariah nations,isolated diplomatically;2)Both nations took advantage of this status to work out mutually beneficialtrade and secret military cooperation agreements. In Germany’s case, this meantusing another nation and its facilities as a proxy by which to develop militarytechnologies that were forbidden to it.It is this use of pariah nations as proxies that became one guiding principle ofpostwar German policy.Such tactics were not merely advocated in secret as in the Madrid Circular, butopenly in German media friendly to Chancellor Adenauer’s government. TheFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, for example, on March 15, 1952, ran an editorialwhich openly advocated another “Rapallo” arrangement between Germany and SovietRussia:What can Russia win if she plays her trump card?…In order to jump out from herpresent isolation she can, exactly as the Rapallo Treaty did 30 years ago, placeGermany as a protecting buffer between East and West. From the politico-economicpoint of view, she could repeat the old game for world power position byconcluding long-term agreements with German industry and by reviving her tradewith Germany. Thus, Russia might re-open the door to the world market. 2[text00010.html#fn2]Consequently, one must look for continuity and consistency in German foreignpolicy from regime to regime, rather than difference. If there is a differencebetween post-World War Two policy and the interwar Rapallo template, it liesonly in that fact that post-World War Two German policy makers did not restrictthe application of the Rapallo Prinzip simply to Russia alone. It became atemplate of action and policy for all manner of pariah states and institutions,among them, not surprisingly, the Islamic concept of jihad, or holy war.A. Jihad: Made in Germany1. Railroads, Jihad and The KaiserMany people are surprised to learn that the modern concept of jihad was made asmuch in Germany as it was in the world of Islam. Indeed, the idea was very muchin Kaiser Wilhelm II’s and one of his close advisors’ heads, Freiherr (baron)Max von Oppenheim, when in 1898 the Kaiser undertook his now famous (orinfamous) tour of the Middle East, stopping at the Sublime Porte to consult withthe Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and his advisors, thence on to Jerusalem wherehe stopped to honor the famous Muslim military commander, Saladin, at his grave,3 [text00010.html#fn3] and thence to Damascus where he gave a famous but now allbut forgotten speech. Wilhelm’s aim was to create the requisite politicalatmosphere to complete one of his pet projects, the Berlin-to-Baghdad Railroad.In the Kaiser’s view, such a railroad would link the Middle East to Berlin andopen its markets to German products, and, of course, allow the rapid transferand projection of German military power into the region and its emerging anddeveloping energy resources, while challenging British power in the region.Wilhelm even entertained the idea of extending the railway through Iran, andinto India. 4 [text00010.html#fn4] The key to this project was the decayingOttoman Turkish Empire, then dominant not only in Asia Minor but in the FertileCrescent and much of the Arabian Peninsula.It was on this tour, during the speech he gave in Damascus in November of 1898,that Wilhelm publicly proclaimed himself “the protector of over three hundredmillion Mohammedans…” 5 [text00010.html#fn5] In doing so, Wilhelm was followingthe conceptions of Baron von Oppenheim, the noted Orientalist, who viewed Islamas an untapped force, and sought to aid in the creation of a pan-Islamistmovement toward that end. We shall return to von Oppenheim shortly.001 [Image00012.jpg]Kaiser Wilhelm II on his famous 1898 Middle East tour001 [Image00013.gif]Kaiser Wilhelm II and Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II in Istanbul001 [Image00014.gif]Wilhelm II with Ottoman Officials001 [Image00015.gif]Kaiser Wilhelm II and Kaiserin Augusta Victoria entering Jerusalem, 1898Wilhelm was consistent in this vision of promoting himself and using hismonarchy as a jihadist revolutionary tool of war, for during the post-Sarajevocrisis that led to the outbreak of the First World War, he wrote in the marginof a diplomatic cable that “England must…have the mask of Christianpeaceableness (sic) torn publicly off her face.…Our consuls in Turkey and India,agents, etc., must inflame the whole Mohammedan world to wild revolt againstthis hateful, lying, conscienceless people of hagglers…” 6 [text00010.html#fn6]Such ideas were not, however, simply the wild ideas of Germany’s famouslyerratic and moody Emperor. They represented “the whole weight of Germany’sofficial policy—the continuation ‘by other means’ of the Eastern policyinitiated in the mid-1890s.” 7 [text00010.html#fn7] This included Germany’salliance with the Ottoman Empire on August 2, 1914, concluded for the expresspurpose of “unleashing a pan-Islamic movement.” 8 [text00010.html#fn8]2. Germany, the Ottoman Empire, and the First Modern Jihad FatwaIf there was one individual who more than any other deserves the credit forreviving and inflaming the concept of jihad in modern times, it was the GermanOrientalist Max Freiherr von Oppenheim. In von Oppenheim’s hands, the jihadistconcept was “nothing less than the weaponization of religion in the service ofGerman territorial ambitions; and it was a weapon that could be wielded withcold efficiency only by those who had no religious sensitivity themselves.” 9[text00010.html#fn9] So pervasive was von Oppenheim’s influence on the formationof the Kaiser’s Mittelostpolitik and its deliberate use of the concept of jihadthat one modern German researcher and sharp critic of Berlin’s Middle Easternpolicy, Matthias Küntzel, has qualified the contemporary phenomenon ofIslamicist jihad as “made in Germany.” 10 [text00010.html#fn10]Von Oppenheim (1860-1946) was a son of the Jewish banking dynasty of the samename, which had converted to Catholicism in 1858 to marry into nobility. Heabandoned a career in diplomacy—though never completely severing his contactswith the German Foreign Ministry—to pursue archaeological interests in theMiddle East, learning Arabic in university. 11 [text00010.html#fn11] The factthat von Oppenheim maintained his contact with the German Foreign Ministrysuggests that von Oppenheim may have been acting as an espionage agent and agentprovocateur during his years touring and excavating the Middle East. In anycase, by the outbreak of World War One von Oppenheim was back in the ForeignMinistry, summoned to Berlin. Once there, he was taskedwith the detailed preparation of a jihad campaign. At the end of October 1914 hepresented his 136-page “Memorandum Concerning the Revolutionizing of the IslamicTerritories of our Enemy.” In it he proposed that this should be a jointGerman-Turkish campaign, in which Muslims would be incited to jihad in their ownlanguages, with the aim of weakening the enemy and alleviating the pressure onthe main European fronts. The Germans, according to Oppenheim, should run thecampaign with money, material, and personnel, while the Ottomans would proclaimit and implement it militarily. 12 [text00010.html#fn12]These detailed plans found public expression in Wilhelm’s desire to foment “thewhole Mohammedan world in a wild revolt” 13 [text00010.html#fn13] against theBritish. The Chief of the German General Staff, Field Marshal von Moltke, echoedthese calls, by stating that it was time “to arouse the fanaticism of Islam,”and the Kaiser cabled the Turkish War Minister Enver Pasha that “His Majesty theSultan must summon the Muslims of Asia, India, Egypt, and Africa to a holy warfor the Caliphate.” 14 [text00010.html#fn14] This is one of the first times thatthe idea of a pan-Islamic Caliphate was mentioned in the context of a holy warby a modern leader. It was Oppenheim’s friendship with the Sultan and also withthe Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, 15 [text00010.html#fn15] Al Husseini, that wouldmake such a policy feasible.The Kaiser, who obviously held similar ideas to von Oppenheim, gave thismemorandum his approval, 16 [text00010.html#fn16] and thus on November 14, 1914,“On the Sultan’s instruction, the highest Ottoman jurist in Constantinopleissued a fatwa declaring the 1914 jihad the personal duty of every Muslim. Atthe same time, he threatened all Muslims who ‘fight against the allied Ottomans,Germans, and Austro-Hungarians’ with ‘the punishment of Hell.’” 17[text00010.html#fn17] As Matthias Küntzel observes, this is a unique departure,or rather, perversion of the concept of jihad, for it was “undoubtedly the firstjihad fatwa in history that declared the struggle against specific unbelieversto be impious.” 18 [text00010.html#fn18]001 [Image00016.gif]German Orientalist and Arabist Max Freiheer von Oppenheim, Orchestrator ofGermany’s World War One Jihadist PolicyThis policy was not without its contemporary critics, for in 1915, DutchOrientalist Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, an advisor to the Royal DutchGovernment, published a critique of von Oppenheim’s policy with the revealingtitle “Holy War, Made in Germany.” 19 [text00010.html#fn19] Hurgronje’s chiefcriticism was prophetic—as we shall see in the case of Iran—for he pointed outthat many intellectuals in Islamic countries had come to hold a generalconviction “that the mediaeval mixture of religion and politics, which thesystem of Islam wanted to uphold for ever(sic), is not of our times.” 20[text00010.html#fn20] Hurgronje warned that by stirring the stew of jihad, theIslamic world would only be held back in a repressive mediaevalism by closingdown the growing voices within Islam itself at that time for a reform of theculture.The criticism fell on deaf ears, however, for as the war got underway, vonOppenheim created an intelligence unit which was but a center for directingjihadist activities. This center, the Oriental Intelligence Unit, was filledwith carefully chosen personnel, from German Orientalists to “Muslims fromPersia, Turkey, the Caucasus, Georgia, India, and North Africa, along witheleven translators and eleven other support staff. The Unit was tasked withstirring up the Muslim population of the French and British overseas possessionsfrom North Africa to India.” 21 [text00010.html#fn21] By December 1915,Oppenheim’s group had published over five thousands magazines, pamphlets, andnewspapers, “with print runs of between 2,500 and 26,000 copies” with its totaloutput of jihadist literature being “some 2.5 million items.” 22[text00010.html#fn22] Even Gustav Stresemann, widely regarded during theinterwar period as one of Germany’s more capable statesmen and Chancellors andas a man of peace, toured Turkey in 1916, and gave Oppenheim’s jihad group hisenthusiastic approval. 23 [text00010.html#fn23]The consequences of von Oppenheim’s jihadism are unfortunately still with us,for it secularized the concept by detaching it from standard Koranic doctrineand practice, for which only a restored and reunited Caliphate could issue acall for offensive jihad, since the Caliph was regarded as “God’s representativeon Earth and the only one entitled to decree such a war.” 24[text00010.html#fn24] Von Oppenheim’s concept effectively detached the idea ofjihad from that of the Caliphate and leaving it not only in the hands ofindividual Muslim clerics, but allowing the idea of a “partial jihad” againstcertain specific groups of “infidels” rather than a universal matter against allnon-believers. 25 [text00010.html#fn25] Von Oppenheim also advocated newtechniques of jihad, for in the Ottoman fatwa of 1914, the concept was no longerrestricted to field armies and conventional battles, but now also incorporatedguerilla tactics of terror cells and isolated assassins and murders. 26[text00010.html#fn26] These secularized or modernized notions of jihad made itsway into the thinking of the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt, and hence, is with usstill. 27 [text00010.html#fn27]3. Germany, Jihad, and IranThe Ottoman Empire was not, however, the sole instrument on which von Oppenheimplayed his jihadist music; the other—one with implications which persist to ourown times—was Persia. Indeed, how “Persia” became “Iran” is also a part of thisstory, and once again, long-term German economic and geopolitical interests arein the thick of it. 28 [text00010.html#fn28] Germany’s long association withIran can thus be traced to Oppenheim’s influence on the formation of long-rangeGerman policy under the Kaiser, a policy that continued under Hitler and theNazi regime with little to no change:During the First World War, Kaiser Wilhelm succeeded in getting himselfacclaimed by traditional Shiites as “Hajj Wilhelm Muhammed” and a hero in thestruggle against Persia’s archenemies, Russia and Britain. Two decades later,Shiite clerics rediscovered this passion for Germany. Now, Adolf Hitler wasdeemed Muhammed’s successor and the Shiite Messiah. The especially closerelations of the Nazi period reverberate to this day. For example, in 2008,Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former Iranian president, held up the strategic alliancebetween the two countries in the Second World War as a model for today. 29[text00010.html#fn29]Here, as elsewhere, it was von Oppenheim’s 1914 memorandum that laid out theGerman policy.However, in the case of Iran, there was a long-term consequence, not only forthat country, but for the rest of the world, that persists to this day. Urgingthat Germany incite the extremist and fundamentalist clergy in rural Persia andback it with what essentially amounted to money in the form of bribes ortribute, 30 [text00010.html#fn30] the Persian Shiite clergy issued their ownversion of Oppenheim’s “partial jihad” Fatwa in 1915. The Shah was encouraged toenter the war on the side of the Central Powers, and threatened to be replacedif he did not. 31 [text00010.html#fn31] The long term consequence of Germany’sIranian policy was exactly that predicted by the Dutch Orientalist Hurgronje: itmarginalized the modernist and moderate Muslims who wanted to change the natureof their culture and end the mediaeval backwardness imposed on them by strictobservation of Koranic precepts:Max von Oppenheim’s memorandum had not, however, taken account of the pro-GermanPersians of the Democratic Party. They were taken aback by the German empire’ssudden jihad mania. They had broken from medieval Islam and embraced the modernworld: how could they now be expected to wax enthusiastic for jihad? The reporton the discussions with the Democratic Party sent by the German chargéd’affaires von Kardoff to the German Chancellor on March 20, 1915, is telling.The “holy war,” he wrote, “has been received by the Democratic Party withreserve and even with a kind of supercilious reticence. The recently enlightenedDemocrats, who, along with their break with other old institutions, are nolonger willing to comply with the strict dogmas and customs of religion, sawthemselves, as regards the jihad concept, which they consider based on outmodedideas, faced with a situation that presents an unreasonable demand to theirmodernism.…Each of my meetings with the Democratic Party leader, Suleiman Mirza,has had the goal of overcoming these reservations.” Not without success, as vonKardoff would later report: “While the government at first refused to call for aholy war…we succeeded in gradually getting the Democratic Party accustomed tothe idea of using jihad as a pacemaker.” 32 [text00010.html#fn32]This policy not only made the growth of a moderate Shiite Islam next toimpossible, but it had such long term repercussions that when the Khomeinirevolution overthrew the Shah in 1979, not surprisingly, it was Germany alonethat of Western nations continued friendly relations with the new regime, 33[text00010.html#fn33] relations that had, of course, also been friendly underthe Shah.The reality underlying this continued relationship was more than justpolitical—it was economic. Germany’s share of Persia’s/Iran’s trade hadconsistently been the largest of any western Power since the days of the Kaiser,but under the Nazi regime it ballooned until the British-Russian invasion ofAugust 1941 put an end to it. By 1941, Germany’s share of Iranian imports wasforty-three percent, almost half of the nation’s imports, and similarly, itsshare of Iran’s exports was forty-seven percent. 34 [text00010.html#fn34] Thischanged, of course, during the Anglo-Soviet invasion in 1941. Russia desperatelyneeded Allied logistical support and weapons, and the route which offered theleast chance of Axis interdiction was through Persia/Iran. The invasionsucceeded in opening the route for Allied supplies, but it also succeeded inreinforcing tradition Persian antipathies against the Russians and British. 35[text00010.html#fn35] The Shah, Reza, openly sympathetic to the Nazis, and whoin 1934 on Berlin’s urging had changed Persia’s name to Iran—Farsi for“Aryan”—in order to emphasize the supposed racial commonality with the Germanpeople, 36 [text00010.html#fn36] was removed by the Allies.Prior to his removal, however, one encountered once again the Rapallo Prinzip,as German financial and military advisors, including Reichsbank PresidentHjalmar Schacht (whom we will encounter again in connection with Iran) andHitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach, visited Tehran, 37[text00010.html#fn37] in the 1930’s to cement the ties that had begun under theWeimar Republic, which had used Iran, as it had used the Soviet Union, to buildGerman armaments factories and equipment outside of Germany, circumventing theTreaty of Versailles and the Allied military attaches combing the countrysearching for any sign of German rearmament. The firms of Krupp andRheinmetall-Borsig both built plants in German-friendly Persia, a move perfectlyin accordance with Reza Shah’s own ideas for modernizing his army. 38[text00010.html#fn38]Even though Reza Shah Pahlavi had been ousted by the Allies, it was not the lasttime Iran, or the world, would hear of the Pahlavis, nor was it the end ofpro-German sympathies in that nation, for throughout World War Two, Iranianpartisans, with German intelligence support, sabotaged Allied shipments. 39[text00010.html#fn39] For the moment, however, we must leave Iran, and focus onanother manifestation of the Rapallo template: the pursuit of forbidden weaponsvia proxy states.B. The Rapallo Prinzip Goes Nuclear: The Secret Collaboration on South Africa’sBomb1. The Early Phase: Secret Projects, Open Pledges, and an Uncomfortable QuestionIn 1952, when the rubble of the Second World War in Europe was still beingcleaned and carted away in what was now the Western Zone of occupied Germany,the famous—or rather, infamous—armaments firm of Krupp had successfully begun aproject in the town of Jülich, a mere twelve miles from the border with theNetherlands. The project was something of a secret, and could only be reached bya circuitous drive, and even then, one had to have a pass to enter the facility.The Krupp firm had, of course, established its notoriety in the First World Waras not only providing the bulk of Germany’s prodigious artillery forces, but ashaving secretly built the road mobile 16.5” “Big Bertha” siege guns that hadstunned the Allies in 1914, and the even more fantastic “Paris Gun” (or, as theGermans called it, the Kaiser Wilhelm Geschutz), the 8” gun that had shelledParis in 1918 from over 70 miles away, making its projectiles the first manmadeobjects in modern times to enter the lower regions of outer space. It was theKrupp firm that had built the enormous—and enormously impractical—31” railroadgun, “Gustav,” whose enormous 7 tons shells had helped level the Russianfortress city of Sevastopol in 1942. 40 [text00010.html#fn40]But the Jülich project dwarfed those efforts both for the enormity of theengineering involved and the potential for military use and mass destruction.Eventually, following the circuitous road to the town, one would have arrived ata black and white striped gate and an armed guard.Presenting your pass, you proceeded through a maze of streets (without athorough advance briefing, no one could hope to negotiate it) to a second gatemarked ATOMKRAFTWERK and produced your credentials for a second armed sentinel.Beyond that, in a heavy forest, stood Alfried’s pride, a tall, queerly shapedstructure bearing the familiar three rings and the sign A TOMREAKTOR.The Kruppianer there called the fifteen-megawatt test reactor KFA, short forKernforschungsanlage (Nuclear Research Plant). Partly subsidized by a Bonnministry, it was founded by a Konzern subsidiary, the BBC-Krupp Institut fürR-Entwicklung (Institute for Reactor Development). If your papers were in order,the youthful director, Dr. Claus von der Decken, would explain how Kruppingenuity achieved a critical mass in 1967…The new pile, Dr, von der Decken explained, would be a breeder reactor. To alayman this was portentous: “After the pilot works, you can get plutonium fromthe breeder, and with that you can hatch a plutonium bomb.” He added, “This onewill only produce juice for the power stations, of course.” Of course. Krupp’sU-235 was provided by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. 41[text00010.html#fn41]These revelations suggest nothing less than that by 1967, West Germany, throughthe Krupp firm’s nuclear “research” project in Jülich, had:1)Produced enough plutonium—a “critical mass”—for an atom bomb; and,2)Even if this reading be untrue, had completed the entire nuclear fuel cycle todo so, if it wished, and given West Germany’s access to other nuclear fuels suchas deuterium and tritium, could easily construct a far more destructive hydrogenbomb, if it chose to do so. Indeed, as we shall see later in this chapter, thereis evidence from Russian sources that Germany is indeed a de facto nuclear, ifnot thermonuclear power.But we are getting ahead of the story.In spite of his reputation as a playboy, under the determination of the Kruppfirm’s last director, Alfried Krupp, West Germany had begun its covert quest fornuclear power shortly after his release from prison in 1952. Notably, Krupp, whohad been sentenced to twelve years imprisonment and forfeiture of all property,a sentence basically meaning that the firm of Krupp was to be dissolved, U.S.High Commissioner for Germany, John J. McCloy, the American lawyer for I.G.Farben who had shared Hitler’s box at the 1936 Olympics (and subsequent WarrenCommission member), pardoned Krupp after only three years, and reversed thedecision on the forfeiture of his property. 42 [text00010.html#fn42]The obvious questions that the Krupp-Jülich project raises are rather important:(1) how, in the postwar devastation, could Krupp have even hoped to undertakesuch a long-term and costly project, requiring the most precise engineering, and(2) how could he have hoped to do so under the watchful eyes of the Alliesoccupying Germany? One clue is afforded by the fact that the American AtomicEnergy Commission supplied him with the uranium-235 for his breeder reactor. Butthat too raises questions. What deals or leverage did the Germans have to pulloff such a transfer of important nuclear fuels, much less to have closed thenuclear fuel cycle by 1967?Whatever the public explanations may be, one must remember that alternativeexplanations may lurk behind the scenes, scenarios I have presented in precedingbooks, namely, that Nazi Germany may have tested an atom bomb in 1944. Thisimplies that it had closed the nuclear fuel cycle before the end of the SecondWorld War, and that through highly secret deals with the Americans, perhapsnegotiated by Nazi Party Reichsleiter Martin Bormann himself, it had transferredat the very end of the war enough stocks of enriched U-235 to the USA along withother prized atomic secrets and technologies including infrared proximity fuses,uranium and fuses which had made their way into the Manhattan Project. 43[text00010.html#fn43] In other words, perhaps, behind the scenes, Bormann andCo., A.G., had begun to call in some of the markers. In any case, if thesespeculations about Krupp’s atomic “research” breeder reactor be true, then theywould afford further postwar corroboration of the thesis that Nazi Germany’swartime atomic research was not nearly the backward affair that postwar Alliedlegend portrayed it to be.2. The Postwar German Nuclear Industry and I.G. Farbena. Rebus Sic Stantibus, and Just Another Form of ArtilleryThere is yet another postwar indicator that the Allied legend of wartime Germannuclear incompetence was not true, and that was the negotiations taking placewith the Adenauer government at approximately the same time that Krupp had begunhis postwar nuclear projects. Adenauer, who had once referred to nuclear weaponsas “just another kind of artillery,” 44 [text00010.html#fn44] had, in the 1954Four Power Treaty between the USA, France, the UK, and the Federal Republic ofGermany, pledged that Germany would not manufacture atomic, biological, orchemical weapons.This was, however, a pledge with a loophole, and additionally, with a uniqueRapallo seasoning added to the recipe for good measure. As was seen in the firstchapter, the postwar Madrid Circular advocated a kind of “brinksmanship” and“blackmail” diplomacy for Germany, whereby the mere threat that the Western Zonewould opt for neutrality or even a Communist takeover could be used as leverageagainst the Western Allies to allow a new sovereign nation to be created fromthe Western Occupation Zones, one with full rights to rearmament. On theAmerican view, as will be seen in a subsequent chapter, this meant that Germanywas treated more as “tomorrow’s ally,” whereas for the United Kingdom andFrance, Germany was, understandably, “yesterday’s enemy.” 45[text00010.html#fn45]On October 1, 1954, in a deal brokered by Eisenhower’s Secretary of State, JohnFoster Dulles, West Germany joined the European Defense Community. Frenchagreement had been purchased at the cost of the West German pledge “not tomanufacture in its territory …atomic, biological and chemical weapons.” 46[text00010.html#fn46] The loophole, and the Rapallo Prinzip are immediatelyevident, for the manufacture of tanks, artillery, and aircraft which had beenforbidden to Germany by the Treaty of Versailles were conveniently circumventedby the building of German factories to manufacture such weapons in the territoryof the Soviet Union by the secret protocols of the Rapallo Treaty. Thus, in1954, one already faced the specter of an extraterritorial nuclear program, 47[text00010.html#fn47] one which, at least in its public “narrative,” had beenexposed by Juan Perón in his press conference of 1951, announcing the “fusionproject” of scientist Ronald Richter! 48 [text00010.html#fn48]De Gaulle’s supporters in France were not fooled by Adenauer’s guarantee, forthey pointed out that “uncontrolled German development of atomic energy forcommercial purposes would, in effect, mean access to atomic weapons.” 49[text00010.html#fn49] Only when Adenauer agreed to limit German production ofuranium for a period of two years did the French finally relent, and even then,it must be recalled that the French embarked on the production of their ownnuclear and thermonuclear weapons and the construction of their own nucleardeterrent, the force de frappe, in the aftermath of German rearmament and thebeginnings of the postwar German nuclear program.But this was not the only reason for French concern over Adenauer’s originalunilateral pledge in 1954. At the conference in London at which Adenauer madehis pledge, attended by U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, a bit oftheater was acted out—quite deliberately—by Adenauer and Dulles for the benefitof the ears of the other diplomats:Adenauer described Dulles’s reaction after he made the non-nuclear pledge in thefollowing words:“Dulles rose from his seat on the other side of the Conference table, walked tobe and spoke in a loud voice so that everybody would hear it. “Mr. Chancellor,you have just declared that the Federal Republic of Germany renounces theproduction of ABC weapons. You meant this declaration, I assume, to be validonly rebus sic stantibus, as all declarations and obligations in internationallaw are.” I answered him equally loudly. “You have interpreted my declarationcorrectly.” The others remained silent. 50 [text00010.html#fn50]Rebus sic stantibus means basically “as the reality stands,” in other words, asthe situation requires. As a term of art in international law, therefore, itmeans that any nation undertaking or committing to a specific course of actionor, in this case, self-limitation, is doing so under certain conditions andcircumstances, and that it reserves “the right to abrogate its internationalcommitment whenever the conditions under which that State agreed to it havechanged.” 51 [text00010.html#fn51] The meaning of Dulles’s and Adenauer’s littlebit of drama was therefore not lost on the other diplomats.But it may have been a bit of distraction as well, for the sum total of thepledge Adenauer was making allowed Germany two ways to outflank the pledge,firstly by invoking the principle of rebus sic stantibus, but secondly, bymaking use of the Rapallo Prinzip to produce nuclear weapons outside of Germany,via proxy states and corporate interests. 52 [text00010.html#fn52]b. Cartelization: a New Mechanism of Sovereignty and Technology Transfer:The Postwar German Nuclear Establishment, I.G. Farben, and the NazisFrom August 8th to August 20th , 1955, an important meeting took place inGeneva, Switzerland, on the peaceful and commercial uses of atomic energy. WestGermany, which had sent a large delegation to this conference, a delegation thatincluded wartime atomic scientist Dr. Otto Hahn, the discoverer of nuclearfission, and another wartime German atomic scientist, Dr. Karl Winnaker,director of Farbwerke Hoechst, met their counterparts from the South Africandelegation. 53 [text00010.html#fn53] It is this meeting that affords our entryinto the some of the workings of the postwar Fascist International, and hence,which also affords an important glimpse at some of the standard “operatingprocedures” within the so-called—and quite misnamed—European Union.Present in this meeting are all the ingredients of the Rapallo template: a proxystate, namely South Africa, which, like the Soviet Union and Weimar Germany ofthe 1920s, was increasingly a pariah nation on the world stage due to its whiteminority government and domestic policy of apartheid. The other pariah nation,seeking to circumvent Allied weapons restrictions by using South Africa as aproxy state to develop advanced weapons, was, of course, West Germany. SouthAfrica had additionally a unique advantage as a proxy state for a covert nuclearweapons program, in that it had abundant deposits of a natural resource vital toatomic weapons research and development: uranium.There is, however, another aspect of the Rapallo Template at work. The presenceof Dr. Winnaker, Director of the powerful German multinational chemicals firm ofHoechst, 54 [text00010.html#fn54] one of the component companies along withBayer, and BASF (Bayrischen Analin und Sodafabrik) that had gone to found thenotorious and notoriously powerful German chemicals cartel, I.G. Farben, acartel so huge and so powerful that the postwar American prosecutors atNuremberg stated the Nazi war machine was I.G. Farben. 55 [text00010.html#fn55]This is yet another important clue how the postwar Nazi International worked:through cartel and licensing agreements, such that it would quite literallybecome a thermonuclear power in its own right, with access to all the aspects ofthe nuclear fuel cycle, and able to build or assemble weapons through a greatlydispersed production system.It could, without much exaggeration, be stated that West Germany’s nuclearprogram was simply the continuation of Nazi Germany’s, and that at the heart ofit, lay the component chemical companies that had organized and founded thecartel. 56 [text00010.html#fn56] Indeed, on March 15, 1976, the German magazineDer Spiegel published a chart of the organization of the West German nuclearindustry, and it reads like a Who’s Who of wartime Nazi atom bomb research andthe companies involved in it: Bayer A.G., Hoechst A.G., Degussa, Siemens, A.E.G.A.G. (Allgemeine Elektricitäts Gesellschaft, A.G., the firm so closely tied tothe Nazi Bell project and to Dr. Ronald Richter’s postwar “fusion” project inArgentina 57 [text00010.html#fn57] ), and of course, the big German banks,Dresdner and Deutsche Bank. 58 [text00010.html#fn58] The goal of this vastproject was consistent from the Nazi period on into postwar West Germany: toobtain a complete and autonomous fuel cycle in independent German hands, 59[text00010.html#fn59] the prerequisite for any viable and sustained nuclear orthermonuclear weapons program.To put these developments and their implications as succinctly as possible, whena nuclear and thermonuclear weapons program is combined with a powerfulinternationally extended, but nonetheless “nationalistic,” cartel such as I.G.Farben or its “smaller” constituents, one has not only a powerful mechanism fortechnology transfer, but a new form of “sovereignty” and the ability tomanufacture such weapons by dispersing component manufacture throughout thecartel organism. As we shall see, covert cartelism, or corporatism, has itsfootprints all over the European Union.c. South Africa, The German Nuclear Cartel, and the Non-Proliferation TreatyThe outlines of the postwar nuclear application of the Rapallo Template thusbecome evident, for South Africa had the uranium, the money, and the technicalexpertise, but not the technology (nor was anyone in the world willing to sellit to them), and West Germany had the money, the technology, but could notafford to undertake covert nuclear weapons development and testing inside ofGermany. It needed a proxy willing to manufacture and test a bomb of Germandesign, produced by a fuel cycle “made in Germany.”All of this, however, would have remained conjecture save for one event thatexposed the whole secret “Nuclear Axis” between West Germany and South Africa(and later, as we shall see, Israel). In September 1974, the South Africanambassador in Bonn hit the official panic button, for he had discovered that 9files, detailing nuclear technology transfers and secret German-South Africannuclear coordination, had been stolen. Indeed, some of the files containedrevealing information that a secret visit to South Africa by a Luftwaffe generalwere for the express purpose of an inspection tour and further detailed militaryand nuclear coordination. 60 [text00010.html#fn60]On September 25, 1974, the South African ambassador to Germany received a plainbrown envelope that revealed who had stolen the files. Inside the envelope was afull color pamphlet printed by the outlawed African National Congress. The titleof the pamphlet was “The Nuclear Conspiracy,” in which some of the stolen filesappeared, along with other classified German and South African documents. Thethesis of the brochure was quite simple: West Germany “was helping South Africato produce a nuclear bomb,” 61 [text00010.html#fn61] or to put it more clumsilybut more accurately, West Germany was helping South Africa to help West Germanyto acquire a nuclear weapons capability. South Africa was the “new Rapallo’s”Soviet Union, to the Weimar Republic’s Bundesrepublik Deutschland. 62[text00010.html#fn62]While both countries had ample geopolitical circumstances that compelled them toemploy an updated version of the Rapallo Template for their nuclearcoordination, yet another factor contributed to it, and that was the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty of 1968, to which West Germany was a signatory, butSouth Africa was not. 63 [text00010.html#fn63] While we shall explore theimplications of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in our considerations ofthe nuclear politics and coordination of Germany and Iran, it is important forthe reader to bear in mind that what will be said there, is equally applicable,if not more so, in the case of Germany and South Africa during the 1970s, forunlike Iran, South Africa was not a signatory at that time to the treaty.In any case, with West Germany’s assistance, South Africa was able to acquirethe technical capability to produce nuclear weapons, and by the late 1970s, bothFrance and the Soviet Union categorically insisted that it was doing so. 64[text00010.html#fn64] Like India at approximately the same time period, SouthAfrica cloaked its program by claiming it was researching “so-called ‘peacefulnuclear explosions’” 65 [text00010.html#fn65] and, additionally, earth tremorsdetected in the Namibian desert, at the time under South Africa’s control, wereunderstood by many to be underground nuclear weapons tests. 66[text00010.html#fn66] Indeed, West Germany’s Bundeswehr made public to DerSpiegel what it knew already via its covert cooperation with South Africa,namely, that the African nation possessed atomic weapons. 67[text00010.html#fn67]But what about Israel?Oddly enough, Israel, which is widely thought to have obtained its nuclearweapons technology and fuels from the United States, actually obtained much ofit from the secret German-South African nuclear axis (as well as from France)via an ingenious mechanism of transfer:Israel apparently also obtained nuclear material from West Germany and France,but because these governments did not want to be seen collaborating with Israel,fake hijackings were arranged. By 1968 Israeli scientists were perfecting theirtechnique of enriching low-grade material, and a deal was made with West Germanyto trade certain expertise for 200 tons of yellowcake. While idling in the calmseas of the Mediterranean in November 1968, the West German freighterScheersberg was ‘raided’ by commandoes, and 200 tons of yellowcake were removed.68 [text00010.html#fn68]By August of 1977, American and Soviet spy satellites had convinced experts thatSouth Africa was getting ready to test an atom bomb in the Kalahari Desert, abomb many experts were convinced was of Israeli design. 69 [text00010.html#fn69]However, a little reflection on this strange troika of pariah nations willreveal the extension of the Rapallo Prinzip at work, for it is far more likelythat the bomb reflected the joint expertise of Israel, South Africa, and WestGermany, with the latter obviously possessing the lion’s share of thatexpertise, for without any doubt, all three nations desired to close the nuclearfuel cycle, and to possess an independent nuclear option.South Africa had the uranium and the expertise, but not the money nor productioncapacity;Israel had the expertise, and a little money, but no sources of uranium for itsenrichment process; and,West Germany had lots of money, a production capacity dwarfing the other twonations, the expertise, but like Israel, no independent access to sources ofuranium as feedstock for its enrichment cycle.It was a ménage á trois atomique “made in Germany.”Where did all of this secret nuclear cooperation leave western Europe’s largesteconomy in the mid-1970s? A Swedish institute projected West Germany’s capacityto manufacture atom bombs, for 1976 alone, to be around 100 bombs per year. Addsome lithium-deuteride and some U-238, shake and stir, and one has 100 3-stagehydrogen bombs. By the 1990s, “the Clinton administration voiced concerns aboutcertain German nuclear projects, notably the storage of some 2.5 tons ofplutonium with no conceivable civilian use in a bunker in the German city ofHanau and the controversial use of highly enriched uranium in a research reactorin Garching near Munich.” 70 [text00010.html#fn70] “No conceivable civilian use”is but a euphemism for the strong possibility that this plutonium wasweapons-grade Pu-239. As we shall discover near the end of this chapter, thereis other strong evidence that Germany is a de facto nuclear and thermonuclearpower. But the road to this conclusion lies through Tehran.C. Iran’s Nuclear Program and Germany1. The Coup Against MossadeghVolumes have been written about the post-World War Two history of Iran, from thecoup against Mossadegh, to the overthrow of the Shah, Reza Pahlavi, to the Iranhostage crisis. The details are all public and well known. But some of thosewell-known details—like all such obvious things—are often quickly passed over,and the uncomfortable questions that they raise are never voiced.Those questions are raised by the personnel one encounters. For example, thewartime Iranian Radio Zeesen announcer Bahram Sharokh became the “propagandachief of Iranian Radio without any protest from the Allies,” 71[text00010.html#fn71] in spite of the fact that he had told the Nazi ambassadorin Tehran, Erwin Ettel, that “the hatred of the Iranian people for the English,Russians, Americans, and Jews must be whipped up as high as possible.” 72[text00010.html#fn72] Nor was this all. By 1952, the pre-war Nazi-Iraniancommercial network was essentially restored, when a new joint Iranian and GermanChamber of Commerce was established in Hamburg under the leadership and auspicesof one Reinhard Hübner, who had been, during the war, “an Eastern affairs expertin Goebbels’s Propaganda Ministry” and, in 1936, the “secretary of the 1937German-Iranian Chamber of Commerce.” 73 [text00010.html#fn73]Even this was not the only manifestation of Nazi continuity in the postwarforeign service of West Germany, for even the first postwar West Germanambassador to Tehran, Lutz Gielhammer, had a dubious past, having been in 1938“a member of the Central Financial Management of IG Farben, and in 1940-41 hebecame the German economic delegate in Afghanistan.” 74 [text00010.html#fn74]Gielhammer became the German ambassador mere days after the CIA-sponsored coupagainst Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh. 75 [text00010.html#fn75]But it is the “CIA”-sponsored coup against Mossadegh that, for our purposes,requires the most scrutiny, for like the CIA-sponsored coup against King Faroukin Egypt, while people like Kermit Roosevelt in Washington may have been“running” things remotely, the actual boots on the ground were, as in the caseof Egypt, “former” Nazis. The litany of pre-and post-Mossadegh Nazi connections,and hence so far as Germany was concerned, continuity and influence withinTehran, is nothing less than breathtaking. German researcher Matthias Küntzellays out those “unspoken questions” in no uncertain terms:The Nationalists around Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh were no lesspro-German than the forces that overthrew him in 1953. In 1952 the Mossadeghgovernment chose as their economic advisor none other than Hitler’s formerfinance minister, Hjalmar Schacht, the very same Hjalmar Schacht who had beendispatched to Tehran in 1936 at Hitler’s behest. In the same year Mossadegh senthis economics expert Ali Amini to Bonn with the task of recruiting hundreds ofGerman oilmen to replace the British experts after the planned nationalizationof the Iranian oil industry. 76 [text00010.html#fn76]It was, of course, this very planned nationalization that led the Britishgovernment to pressure Bonn to back down on sending the oilmen to Tehran, andwhich led the British to request CIA assistance in the overthrow of Mossadegh.It is here that the unspoken questions surface in an acute form, for on theGerman side of the equation, little changed:The overthrow of Mossadegh in 1953 brought the hard core of pro-German Iraniansto power. The new prime minister was General Fazllollah Zahedi, who had been oneof the Abwehr and SD’s closest collaborators during the Second World War and whohad as a result been arrested by the British in 1942. If Zahedi had indeed actedwith CIA support, wrote Der Spiegel in 1953, “then this would not have been thefirst time in postwar history that former German contacts had transferred theirloyalties to the Americans.”Ambassador Gielhammer made no secret of his joy at Mossadegh’s overthrow andcongratulated Zahedi for saving his country from the clutches of communism. Hewas not the only one to feel this way. Former Wehrmacht Lieutenant-ColonelBernhardt Schulze-Holthus, who as an Abwehr agent had striven to underminesecurity in southern Iran during the war, lauded Zahedi’s coup as ananti-communist popular uprising comparable to the pro-German “uprising” of1941-44. 77 [text00010.html#fn77]By 1957, when Chancellor Adenauer himself visited Tehran, the stage was set forthe agreement between the Chancellor and the new Shah for the opening of German“vocational schools” in Iran to provide teachers, equipment, and training. 78[text00010.html#fn78]The unspoken questions here are quite simple: how, in spite of a coup tooverthrow Mossadegh and prevent the nationalization of the British oil companiesin that country, did the Germans manage to maintain a heavy presence andinfluence within both the pre-and post-coup Iranian governments. The answer hasalready been implied: they had, through their long history with Iran, theintelligence and covert network in place to do it. Iran, in short, was to beanother playground for the Nazi International, and another test-bed for theapplication of the postwar nuclear modification of the Rapallo template. Indeed,as we have already seen, Iran had functioned in precisely this capacity duringthe interwar period, just as had the Soviet Union, as the Junkers aircraft firm,and the munitions firms of Krupp and Rheinmetall-Borsig opened plants during the1920s in Iran. 79 [text00010.html#fn79]2. The Shah and the Nuclear Fuel CycleBy the late 1980s and on into the new millennium, the scale of these “trainingprograms,” much of it sponsored by the firm of Thyssen-Krupp, had expanded toinclude training in plant construction and management, materials engineering,and, of course, nuclear engineering. 80 [text00010.html#fn80] For Shah RezaPahlavi, the goal was clear and had been announced in 1974: he intended to openover twenty nuclear power plants throughout Iran, and “to master the wholenuclear fuel cycle, including its militarily relevant components—uraniumenrichment and plutonium extraction.” 81 [text00010.html#fn81]Not surprisingly, Iran’s goal then as now summoned US pressures and anxietiesand created an international controversy. The Shah wanted Iran’s control overthe enrichment process and fuel cycle to be entirely in Iran’s hands, with nointernational oversight, while predictably, Washington “was not prepared totolerate the construction of a national Iranian reprocessing plant.” 82[text00010.html#fn82] The then West German Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, whenceIran would be purchasing a great deal of its reprocessing technology, made itclear to Tehran that Bonn would go ahead with the technology sale undeterred byany pressure from Washington. Tehran could be relatively secure in Bonn’sassurances, for it had just approved the sale of the entire fuel cycle toBrazil, in spite of pressures from Washington not to do so, adding Brazil to thelist of nations that could become “nuclear weapons powers” in short order,should it choose to do so. 83 [text00010.html#fn83] This support for Iran’snuclear ambitions continued even after the overthrow of the Shah and theinstallation of the revolutionary Islamist regime of Ayatollah Khomeini, forWest Germany supported Iran in the Iran-Iraq war, while the USA supported theregime of Saddam Hussein.The pattern by now should be clear: in both South Africa’s case, and in Iran’s,the level of German participation and enablement of the nuclear ambitions ofthese two countries conformed not only to the Rapallo template, but in bothcases, the corporate infrastructure and personnel backing it remained largelythe same structure as obtained in the Third Reich. One is looking at thefootprint of the Nazi International, both inside, and outside, of Europe. Norshould it come as a surprise that part of this footprint conforms to the policybegun under the Kaiser: the use and exploitation of radical Islam againstWestern geopolitical and financial interests.3. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: Iran, South Africa, and GermanyThroughout the preceding survey, occasional reference has been made to theNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the time has come to consider why Germany,a country at the center of so much nuclear proliferation, could be considered asignatory of the treaty in good standing. This consideration will expose one ofthe treaty’s significant weaknesses, and why it could be so easily exploited byan extra-territorial “sovereignty”.Matthias Küntzel points out that article IV of the treaty, the article thatostensibly established the international mechanism to monitor proliferation via“peaceful civilian” projects, contains a huge loophole:…(The) duty to renounce nuclear weapons in Article I is balanced by a duty inarticle IV: “All the Parties to the Treaty undertake to facilitate, and have theright to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materialsand scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclearenergy.” Non-nuclear and nuclear powers are put on the same footing as regardsthe development of “research, production and use of nuclear energy for peacefulpurposes,” with the monitoring of peaceful use of entrusted to the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). These rules give the parties—among them Iran!—theright to acquire all the necessary components of nuclear weapons under IAEAsupervision, as long as they refrain from putting the pieces together.This loophole, which continues to this day to undermine the (non-proliferationtreaty’s) original purpose, is widened further by Article X of the treaty. Thispermits every member state to withdraw from the treaty so long as this step isjustified by “extraordinary events” and the UN Security Council gets threemonths (sic) notice. 84 [text00010.html#fn84]In case one misses the implications of the loophole, Küntzel spells it outplainly: A signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty such as Iran, or moreimportantly, Germany, can “without breaking its terms, produce all theprerequisites for the bomb and then, following a treaty-permitted withdrawal,declare itself a nuclear power.” 85 [text00010.html#fn85]In the context of the nuclear version of the Rapallo Template that we have beenexamining, this has enormous importance, for if one recalls that the consistentpattern of the Federal Republic of Germany since World War Two has been toengage in a nuclear weapons program via proxies such as South Africa, Iran, andas we saw, Brazil, and do so via the same immense multinational corporatestructure utilizing the corporate components of the IG Farben cartel, then itbecomes evident that all the parts for the manufacture of atomic and hydrogenbombs could quite literally be hidden behind several “peaceful” nuclear programsin a variety of nations. Reflector shields for implosion devices could beplanned in one country, manufactured in another; circuitry could be planned inone, assembled in another, and so on. Thus, rather than having a few enrichmentplants or manufacturing plants in one country, one has not only dispersed themanufacturing and assembly capability, but has built redundancy into theprogram, making it even harder to target. Quite literally, the corporatizationof the German program, far more than is true of any other country, means thatany military action against any of the surrogate countries—Iran, South Africa,Israel, Brazil—would have done little to no damage to it at all. If this soundsdisturbingly reminiscent of Nazi Armaments Minister Albert Speer’s dispersed andmodular manufacturing methods, it should, because it is almost the same thing,this time writ large and spread onto a world stage. One could conceivably evensay that Germany itself was being used by a huge corporate interest for thedevelopment of its own nuclear weapons capability.4. The French Force de-Frappe, and Germany, the Hidden Thermonuclear PowerAs if to reinforce these speculations, there was a story that never even made itto the “commentary stage” of Western media reporting, although the story itselfwas reported. On December 2, 2009, the American magazine Time ran an articletitled “What to Do About Europe’s Secret Nukes,” noting that the amount ofnuclear and thermonuclear weapons that the USA had transferred to Belgium, theNetherlands, Italy, and Germany was in the hundreds, and that each nation’s airforce was capable of delivering them. The article was picked up by the Russiangovernment affiliated website Global Research by Professor Michael Chossudovsky,a controversial figure, who commented,The US has supplied some 480 B61 thermonuclear bombs to five so-called“non-nuclear states,” including Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands andTurkey. Casually disregarded by the Vienna based UN Nuclear Watchdog (IAEA), theUS has actively contributed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in WesternEurope. 86 [text00010.html#fn86]But most disturbingly, there’s this:While Germany is not categorized officially as a nuclear power, it producesnuclear warheads for the French Navy. It stockpiles nuclear warheads (made inAmerica) and it has the capabilities of delivering nuclear weapons. Moreover,The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company—EADS, a Franco-German-Spanishjoint venture, controlled by Deutsche Aerospace and the powerful Daimler Groupis Europe’s second largest military producer, supplying France’s M51 nuclearmissile.Germany imports and deploys nuclear weapons from the US. It also producesnuclear warheads which are exported to France. Yet it is classified as anon-nuclear state. 87 [text00010.html#fn87]The French navy’s M51 missile is a submarine launched intercontinental ballisticmissile, complete with MRVed warheads each delivering a thermonuclear warheadthat is estimated to be between 200 and 300 kilotons yield, and which may, infact, be much larger. In other words, France’s strategic nuclear deterrent isbased on a missile which is built by a Franco-Spanish-German consortium, inwhich a German company has controlling interest, and the warheads for themissile are produced by Germany under similar corporate arrangements. Perhapsthis is one reason that the German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeirrecently gave a speech in Berlin to assembled German businessmen andindustrialists that the time had come for Germany’s foreign policy to take on afirmer and more military tone. 88 [text00010.html#fn88]Howsoever one interprets Herr Steinmeir’s remarks, however, one thing now seemsquite clear: just as it succeeded in covertly rearming Germany and making itagain a major power between the World Wars, the Rapallo Template has againrearmed Germany, making it a de facto thermonuclear power, with access tointercontinental delivery systems. And throughout this process, one has noticedanother disturbing pattern, one that we shall again encounter in Part Two, ofcartels orchestrating technology transfers, cartels in which the Germancomponent holds the “controlling interest.” This cartelization or “corporatism”is one of the defining footprints of the Nazi International.D. Postscripts and Segues: The Policy of Containment, Rollback, andDisintegration of the Soviet UnionIn 2010 a rather remarkable book by Ian Johnson appeared outlining the Americanpart in the story of radical Islam and Nazis titled A Mosque in Munich: Nazis,the CIA, and the Rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in the West. In it, one discernsthe post-world War Two application of the German strategy of radicalizing Islamcontinuing, not only under postwar Nazi auspices, but American ones as well, allin an effort to defeat Communism. 89 [text00010.html#fn89] In this book, Johnsonpoints out that the author of America’s long-term strategy of containment androllback of Soviet Communism through psychological operations, George Kennan,was trained at the University of Berlin. 90 [text00010.html#fn90]One of the keys in this long-term effort was American and western dominance ofthe mass electronic media. From this dominance came the creation of thepropaganda outlets, Radio Free Europe, beaming programs into Eastern Europe, andRadio Free Liberty, targeting the Soviet Union itself, both based,non-coincidentally, in Munich, headquarters of General Reinhard Gehlen’s“organization,” later West German intelligence, the Bundes-nachrichtendienst(BND).The rollback strategy was prompted by a doctoral thesis, eventually published in1936, by the German scholar Gerhard von Mende, who postulated that the diverseethnic population within the Soviet Union was exploitable and would break awayfrom the Soviet State, but only if a series of shocks could be dealt to SovietRussia. They would never, he theorized, be able to break away under their ownpower. Von Mende even foresaw that once broken away, these ethnic groups wouldform small nation-states of dubious viability. 91 [text00010.html#fn91] Duringthe Second World War, it was von Mende who, working in Nazi Germany’sOstministerium, helped recruit and organize these ethnic groups into militaryunits for the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS via a series of “liaison offices” betweenthe ministry and the military. These organizations were rolled into the postwarpropaganda efforts of the CIA’s Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty to such anextent that “Radio Liberty relied so heavily on Nazi collaborators that thestation would have closed without them. One estimate put the proportion of RadioLiberty employees who had worked for the Nazis at 75 to 80 percent.” 92[text00010.html#fn92] In other words, just as the Nazi wartime militaryintelligence unit of General Gehlen’s Fremde Heere Ost was for all intentionsand purposes the actual boots-on-the-ground human intelligence within the Sovietbloc for the CIA, so too was the CIA’s postwar propaganda efforts yet anotherfront for a group of Nazi propagandists. And of course, key in this effort wereboth the American and Nazi interest in exploiting radicalized Islam for theirown long-term strategic purposes of the defeat of Communism.Perhaps, given all that has been surveyed in this chapter, one could reasonablyconclude that the “war on terrorism” is really a cover for a very different war,a war by, and on, the Nazi International, and the international corporate powerstructure it represents. That power structure, as has been suggested in thischapter, remains concentrated and centered in Europe and Germany themselves, andthus, it is to an examination of its relationship to the European Union itselfthat we must now turn, but not until we review the patterns that have emergedthus far…1 [text00010.html#fn_1] Barbara Rogers and Zdenek Červenka, The Nuclear Axis:The Secret Collaboration Between West Germany and South Africa (New York: NewYork Times Books, 1978), p. 345.2 [text00010.html#fn_2] Cited in T.H.

Levenda observes that this situation was somewhat ironic: “Thus,we had the English archaeologist Lawrence on one side of the conflict and theGerman archaeologist Oppenheim on the other: each trying to convince his side ofthe righteousness of his respective cause, and each manipulating the situation(and the trust) of the Arabs in service to European masters, and a post-warstrategy that would have benefited no one but the Europeans.” (Levenda, TheHitler Legacy, p. 67). And in the supreme irony, with Oppenheim, never a convertto Islam, was “a German of mixed Catholic and Jewish ancestry who was neitherArab nor Muslim” (Levenda, op. cit., p. 66) who was, in the supreme hypocrisy,urging jihad!

The document was entitledEuropäische Wirtschftsgemeinschft’ (European Economic Community).” ChristopherStorey 1 [text00011.html#fn1]D ISCERNIBLE PATTERNS AND FOOTPRINTS have now emerged which, before taking theplunge into the subterranean world of the power and financial politics of theEuropean Union, it would be prudent to review and highlight.1)The Madrid Circular of 1950 was the alleged product of the German GeopoliticalCenter in Madrid, and thus allegedly of the postwar Nazi International. However,as was seen in chapter one, this author was unable to find any corroboration ofthe existence of this document beyond the books of T.H. Tetens. Thus, amethodology of corroboration had to be developed by seeking historicalantecedents within Imperial and Nazi Germany, and in postwar West German foreignpolicy. When viewed in this fashion, a number of the Circular’s policy positionsappear not only to have been adopted, but the Circular itself appears unusuallyprescient of developments occurring decades later. Among these developments, onemust take particular note of the following:a)The document advocates the creation of a European community, inclusive of acustoms union or common market, which federation would leave Germany, as thedominant economic power, in the position of the most influence. The purpose ofthe federation on the world stage is to create a “third way” between theopposing Communist and Atlantic blocs, with the federation serving to amplifyGerman geopolitical influence on the world stage;b)The Circular advocates the policy of promoting East-West bloc tensions even tothe point of a war between the USA and USSR, 2 [text00011.html#fn2] while theGerman-led Europe remained neutral in such confrontations, emerging as the clearleading power bloc after such a conflict. Certain key steps are involved inimplementing this strategy:i)The Rapallo Treaty of the 1920s between the Soviet Union and the WeimarRepublic is to be used to rearm West Germany and circumvent any treatyrestrictions imposed on it on the development of certain armaments capabilities,particularly atomic, biological, or chemical weapons of mass destruction. 3[text00011.html#fn3] As was seen in the previous pages, the Rapallo Prinzip wasfaithfully followed by the German Federal Republic as agreements for economiccooperation with “pariah nations” such as South Africa, Israel, and Iran wereused to disguise extensive military coordination and the technological transfersnecessary to acquire the complete nuclear fuel cycle, and nuclear andthermonuclear weapons, via proxy states. This extensive proliferation effortserves to create extraterritorial nuclear and thermonuclear capabilities in thehands of the large corporations and cartel arrangements making it possible, andalso creates a multi-layered redundancy in the proxy states utilizing Germannuclear technology, which includes continental Europe’s only declaredthermonuclear power, France.ii)The Circular explicitly states that “for us,” i.e., the Nazi International,“the war never stopped,” 4 [text00011.html#fn4] and draws clear support for thisin the lack of any formal representative of the Nazi Party at any of the formalsurrenders of 1945. The clear implication of this assertion is that the NaziInternational was alive and well in the heart of Germany and Europe itself, apoint corroborated in official British reports concerning the Naumann Coupattempt against Adenauer’s government, as will be seen below:iii)The long term goal was to isolate America via the short-term, andsuccessful, derailment of the Morgenthau Plan to de-industrialize Germany, 5[text00011.html#fn5] and then to manipulate the USA into increasing isolation ofits “dollar diplomacy” via engineered wars, economic crises, and destabilizationof the Middle East, 6 [text00011.html#fn6] while simultaneously the German-ledEuropean federation pivoted its economic trade to the East; 7[text00011.html#fn7]iv)Once this occurred, the USA would be forced to rely increasingly on more andmore force and a “unipolar attitude,” accurately anticipated by the Circular,and once this occurred, the terms of the Atlantic Alliance could be voided,since America will have become the aggressor nation, and the European nationswould be under no obligation to join its military ventures; 8[text00011.html#fn8]v)All of this would be accomplished via covert operations and an extensivenetwork of contacts in industry and government—including America 9[text00011.html#fn9] —a network which the Circular explicitly states may haveincluded personnel “executed for treason” in the July 1944 “bomb plot” againstAdolf Hitler, a breathtaking assertion either suggesting that the plot was adeliberate false flag event to deceive the Allies, protect high-ranking Nazis bymaking them “dead” to further Allied investigation(after all, one does notsearch for people one assumes are dead), or a crisis of opportunity exploited bythe Nazi hierarchy for the same purpose; 10 [text00011.html#fn10]2)The stated goal of the Madrid Circular of a German-led European federation wasin fact a consistent goal of members of the German military, political, andfinancial elite from General Bernhardi and Reichskanzler Theobald vonBettmann-Hollweg prior to and during World War One, to post-World World war TwoWest German Chancellors from Adenauer to Helmut Kohl, Gerhard Schröder andAngela Merkel. While we have yet to examine the Nazis and their own statementsand plans for European Union in any detail, which will be the main subject ofthe next part of this book, what is evident thus far is that the Madrid Circularaccurately reflects the consistency of this vision;a)We have noted, however, that certain Nazi documents beginning in 1943 andcontinuing right to the end of the war, including Generalplan 1945, advocatedsuch a German-led European federation. Additionally, we noted that theGeneralplan 1945 spelled this out in terms of political federation, economicunion, and as will be seen in the next part of this book, an amalgamation of lawand jurisprudence. This union is to eventually include European Russia in itsembrace. 11 [text00011.html#fn11]b)Those wartime Nazi documents also advocated a policy of psychological warfareagainst the Western powers, and we suggested in the previous pages that theNaumann Coup attempt against Adenauer’s government, the responsibility for whichthe British explicitly laid at the feet of the postwar Nazi International, wasone such operation, since the operation allowed the Adenauer government,notwithstanding its own Nazis and pro-Nazi sympathizers, to appear moderate.3)Finally, we observed the pattern of interlocking corporate and cartel drivenmilitary and political manipulation of Islam by means of radicalizing it, and inradicalizing it, weaponizing it for use in destabilizing the Middle East andupsetting British and American interests in the region. The result, again, hasbeen exactly that as predicted by the Madrid Circular, for as Washington mustincreasingly use a heavy hand in the region, it becomes increasingly isolated.In the case of the German nuclear “cartel,” we discovered that the Germannuclear industry, in its historical roots, is comprised largely of the componentcompanies of the IG Farben cartel, all working in concert, a point whichsuggests that while Farben may be officially dead in name, it is dead only inname. Given the consistent connection of German policy toward radical Islam, andits promotion of jihad since the days of the Kaiser and its consistent abilityto endure shifts of government in Iran from World War Two through the overthrowof both Mossadegh and the Shah, the known Nazi connections to other radicalIslamic groups, 12 [text00011.html#fn12] it was even suggested that the “war onterrorism” might be a convenient cover for a war on the Nazi International, awar which America and her allies would have great difficulty selling to theirpopulations.With this review in hand, it is time to look much closer at Nazi plans for theEuropean Union, and at the European Union itself, to see if the face the Fascismin it, of which many Europeans complain, is merely a populist complaint, or ifin fact it is rooted to any degree in reality.001 [Image00017.gif]Adolf Hitler and the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Al Husseini1 [text00011.html#fn_1] Christopher Storey, The European Union Collective, Enemyof its Member States: A Study in Russian and German Strategy to complete Lenin’sWorld Revolution (London and New York: Edward Harle, 2002), p. 147.2 [text00011.html#fn_2] p. 9.

Mention his name outsidethose circles then or now to the general public, and few would know it, norunderstand why his novel was a key glimpse into the international financial andpower politics of that day up to our own. Even though he was not well-knownoutside his professional circles, however, he took no chances and published hisnovel—The Alchemy Murder —under a nom de plume, Peter Oldfield, for in it hedetailed what he no doubt had observed forming before his very eyes, in hiscapacity of occupying the rather peculiarly good observational platform heoccupied with which to observe it.A. Prophecy from the Pages of a Novel1. The Prophecy ItselfThough it is set in the world of the late 1920s, “Oldfield’s” novel reminds oneof a typical Robert Ludlum spy-thriller from the 1970s. Briefly, a wealthy manis murdered on a train traveling from France to Switzerland. As it turns out,the wealthy man has a daughter, to whom he bequeathed not only a legacy ofwealth, but of a vision, which is articulated in detail toward the middle of thenovel in a lengthy epistolary testament the murdered wealthy man composed to hisdaughter. We cite it in full here, exactly as it occurs in the novel’s text:“My dearest daughter,” it ran, “You will only receive this letter if death comesto me before I have been able to attain what is now my life’s ambition. Itcontains a request that you should make a big sacrifice, but I believe ourmutual love is so great that you will not hesitate to devote any amount up tohalf the value of my entire estate that may be necessary to complete my work.“I have hoped that I should achieve something of lasting good in this life. Someof the companies I have been instrumental in promoting will prove efficientunits of production and will help to improve industrial conditions in theseislands. But I have been blessed with great wealth which I would like to put tobetter purpose than this. Here, then, is my scheme.“The problem of our generation is to abolish war, for, if we do not succeed indoing that, the chances are that a war will destroy our civilisation. Butnations will only resort to the peaceful solution of disputes and lay down theirarms if we can rid them of fear. The savage lived a life of constant fear; themodern State has given its citizens a feeling of security in their dealings witheach other, never attained before. Is it the same in the intercourse betweennations? Our war experiences are too vivid to allow us to believe that. For theprogress of science has immeasurably increased man’s power of destruction, and,in consequence, his fear of being destroyed.“A few months ago, in the House of Lords, some details of gas warfare were givenby Lord Halsbury, who quoted from an official manual published by the WarOffice. Chemists know more than was contained in that ‘Manual,’ but even thosedetails suffice to show that the last war was child’s play in comparison withwar that could be waged to-day. Lord Halsbury said that one bomb dropped inPicadilly Circus could destroy all life between Regent’s Park and the Thames.Forty tons of dipenylchloroarsine would kill every one in a triangle forms bythe lines drawn between Chalk Farm, Clapham and London Docks. These new gasescan be carried in liquid form and blown into the finest dust with the help ofhigh explosive; this means that strong and heavy containers are not necessaryand the airman’s task is greatly simplified in consequence. There are gaseswhich set up such acute irritation that men tear off their gas masks in madnessand breathe in the poisoned atmosphere. And remember that each year, each monthalmost, the methods of destruction are developed, perfected.“Can nothing be done in the face of this menace?“There is one way which has been recommended on the highest authority—that ofthe League of Nations, which realized the dangers of this problem several yearsago and appointed a committee of chemists to study it. It is the proposal forthe establishment of international chemical combines, since an internationalelement in the direction of these industries would lessen the danger of onecountry using a new discovery to establish its power over all others.“I believe I have improved upon this recommendation of the League’s chemicalexperts. After long and careful investigation in many countries—investigationwhich would have been impossible without the aid and devotion of my friend andsecretary, Mr. Campbell, I have now worked out my plan in detail. Here are therough outlines—he will give you fuller information.“1. I propose to buy a sufficient number of shares in the leading chemicalcombines of the world to get my representatives elected on their boards ofdirectors. The British and German chemical industries, for example, are alreadyunited in great national associations, and similar concerns are being formed inother countries. It is not too easy to buy enough shares to secure influence,but I have entered into long negotiations and I think I shall succeed. Thepeople ask me what I want them for and I am not willing yet to show my hand. Ishall probably not have enough money to buy all I need, but I am going tointerest my old American business friend, John Garsyte, who, like myself, hasmoney and no great use for it.“2. Should I succeed in obtaining these shares, I shall distribute them in equalproportions to the leading Powers—Great Britain, France, Germany and Italy —andalso perhaps a part to some smaller Powers. As to America and Japan, here Ishall have to count on Garsyte’s assistance.“3. Each of the States which thus becomes a shareholder will have the right toappoint a representative on the Board of Directors of each of the concerns inthe territory of the other States. There will thus be an American, a Japanese, aFrenchman, a German, etc., on the Board of our own Associated ChemicalIndustries, but we shall in turn have our representatives in the American,Japanese, French and German concerns.“4. Moreover, I propose that a number of foreign engineers should work in ourfactories, and that we should have British engineers in the foreign factories.In the full knowledge of what our neighbours do I find the greatest possibilityof eliminating fear and of carrying out the obligation, under Article 8 of theLeague of Nations Covenant, ‘to interchange full and frank information as to thescale of our armaments and industries that could be adapted to warlikepurposes.’ 5 [text00013.html#fn5]There ends the substantive part of the murdered industrialist’s testament to hisdaughter.2. The Pattern in the ProphecyOne will have noted that there are a number of strange things about thisepistolary peroration:1)First, the author’s recommendations are based on those which were supposedlyrecommended by the League of Nations, which functioned as a platform by which hecould observe developments and, through his personal wealth, act upon them;2)Those “League of Nations-sanctioned recommendations” advocate theestablishment of international chemical “combines,” or, to put it more closelyand plainly, monopolies and cartels whose sheer international extent and powerwould prevent the always-errant nation-state from going on the warpath andexploiting technological advances. Left unspoken, of course, was who was goingto watch the cartel watchdog;3)Thus, cartelization (or “Rhenisch corporatism” as we shall see it called laterin this chapter) becomes a principal method for establishing and maintaininginternational and domestic political and economic order;4)However, as is apparent from the novel’s outline of this process, the focus isalmost entirely European, as the interests of the four major Great Powers ofEurope—France, Italy, Britain, and of course Germany—are the countries mostimplicitly the center of the novel’s attention, which, to buttress its advocacyof the creation of such cartels, notes that British and German chemicalindustries were already combined in such “associations” or cartels. Thus,cartelization is really being advocated as a means to dominate Europe, and thusput an end to war;5)What is also being advocated is that by means of such cartels, any advancemade or known to one country will, by the international extent of such cartels,immediately become known, and available to another. Or to put it more plainlyand closely once again, cartels can, and will, function as the means oftechnology transfer; and finally,6)The novel, as indicated, was written by a man well-known in certain circles ofpower, and thus fits, or confirms, a pattern that many people assume the “powerelite” operates under, namely, that they intentionally disclose their plans tothe hoi polloi in some form or fashion, often in the guise of fiction. 6[text00013.html#fn6]So who was “Peter Oldfield” in reality?The answer is found in Hungarian author Adam Lebor’s one-of-a-kind study of theBank of International Settlements, The Tower of Basel: The Shadowy History ofthe Secret Bank that Runs the World. There, one discovers that “Peter Oldfield”was none other than Swedish banker Per Jacobssen (1894-1963), who, we arefurther informed,…co-wrote two thrillers, fusing his knowledge of international finance anddiplomacy. The Death of a Diplomat, which was set in the League of Nations, waspublished in eight languages, and the film rights sold to a German company. TheAlchemy Murder was macabrely prescient—especially when Hermann Schmitz, the CEOof IG Farben, joined the board of the (Bank of International Settlements). Thebook’s storyline focused on chemical companies producing poison gas. 7[text00013.html#fn7]001 [Image00018.gif]“Peter Oldfield,”a.k.a. Swedish Banker Per Jacobsson, 1894-1963Prescient, however, Jacobssen was not, for his novel, published in 1929,followed the establishment of the Farben cartel by the German combines of Bayer,Hoechst, and BASF (Bayrische Analin-und Soda-Fabrik) in 1925, a combine which,as is now well-known, engulfed British Imperial Chemicals, the French chemicalfirm of Kuhlmann, and even Standard Oil, and a variety of other powerfulAmerican corporations, in a tapestry of licensing and patent swap agreements,arguably becoming the most powerful corporation ever to be seen in worldhistory, before or since.Jacobssen also wrote himself into The Alchemy Murder, for he served as afinancial advisor for the League of Nations from 1920 to 1928 before he joinedthe Bank for International Settlements as an economics advisor, writing itsreports. Additionally, Jacobssen was an advocate of “European federalism andsupranationalism.” 8 [text00013.html#fn8] It is therefore through the Bank ofInternational Settlements that one must first enter the labyrinth of elitistpower structures behind the European Union, which is but a tapestry of suchstructures, and not a nation-state 9 [text00013.html#fn9] in any recognizablesense.B. The Bank of International Settlements: A Sovereign Bank without Borders andAbove Any Law1. Prelude: Hjalmar Schachta. Reparations, Hyper-Inflation, and the RentenmarkIf one were to read the typical college history textbook rehearsing the causesfor World War Two, among the most frequently and monotonously mentioned are theseverity of the Versailles Treaty reparations and war guilt clauses againstGermany, and the resulting hyper-inflation in the Weimar Republic, as theprinting presses were run to make payments and settle debts with increasinglyworthless paper Reichsmarks. 10 [text00013.html#fn10] But as one tip-toesthrough the sanitized history of such textbooks, few people ever raise theimportant question of how Germany ever managed to re-stabilize the Reichsmark.The impression is usually left that the Nazis somehow did this all on their own,by nationalizing the currency, and issuing debt-free currency. That story istrue enough, as far as it goes, but does not go nearly far enough, for if thetruth be told, the currency was re-stabilized before the Nazis came to power,and that was largely due to the efforts of one man, Dr. Hjalmar Horace GreeleySchacht, the “Old Wizard” of Germany’s Reichsbank. Just how he did it containssome important lessons for the principles being used by financial and industrialelites down to our own time.By the early 1920s, Weimar Germany was in the grip of hyper-inflation, as theprinting presses had been run to make up for the lack of liquidity in Germany, alack brought about by the war reparations. Private currencies, issued often bycorporations or local governments appeared as a stopgap means of settling debtsthat could not be paid in normal paper money, as that was fleeing abroad. 11[text00013.html#fn11] The result, of course, was hyper-inflation, and thedestabilization of all German money. Into this situation stepped a Germanpolitician named Helfferich, who proposed issuing bonds “payable not in papermoney but in kind (a ton of coal, a hundred-weight of potash).” 12[text00013.html#fn12] Helferrich not only proposed this but, says the “OldWizard,” he went much further by proposing the issuance of commodities backedcurrency on those bonds. 13 [text00013.html#fn13]After much political wrangling, a compromise was reached with the creation ofthe so-called Rentenmark, a currency equal to the gold mark in law, but “coveredby a cautionary mortgage on the whole of German landed property, so that anygiven sum in Rentenmarks could be exchanged at any time for a like sum inmortgage bonds.” 14 [text00013.html#fn14] As he was the President of theReichsbank at the time, it fell to Schacht to “carry out the currency reform ina practical manner.” 15 [text00013.html#fn15] Of course, any idea that Schachtsat quietly in his corner while the Reichstag debated the currency reform law isridiculous, and one can be reasonably certain that he steered the process asmuch as it was within his power to do. The result was a much more stablecurrency, one that fluctuated within the value of the collateralizing mortgageswith just enough stability to give Schacht the needed breathing space to end therampant currency speculations on the Reichsmark and end the hyper-inflation.At this juncture a pause is in order to consider the sweeping implications ofthe Rentenmark scheme, for its long-term implications are profound, as itappears to be a method of financial operation that was seized upon later byother financial oligarchs:1)It is the first appearance in modern times of the idea of “backing” papermoney with a commodity other than gold, in this case, real property assets;2)This scheme would appear much later in history as the Rothschilds would beseen backing such a plan for a global currency based on the world’s “wildernessland” at various “World Wilderness Congresses”. This scheme would also seem tohave made its appearance again in the “mortgage backed securities bundles” 16[text00013.html#fn16] than began to appear in the 1990s and which in part led tothe bailout meltdowns of the mid-2000s;3)The Rentenmark plan as such thus represented a mortgage on Germany itself,potentially allowing its assets—such as the state-run Deutschereichsbahn and itsthousands of miles of railroads—to be controlled by private interests. ForSchacht, an ardent nationalist, this was intolerable, and the scheme was viewedby him as only a temporary measure;4)By representing a currency and bond issue collateralized by real propertyassets, one sees the earliest and first appearance of the idea that I haveadvanced in previous books, namely, that outer space itself, and whatever wasfound there, may have formed part of the secret collateralization of the hiddensystem of finance established by President Harry S. Truman in 1947. 17[text00013.html#fn17]Schacht then followed this scheme up with one that in its essence can only bedescribed as “Venetian,” a breathtaking scheme he laid out in conversation withhis counterpart in the Bank of England, Montagu Norman. Recalling thisconversation in his memoirs, Schacht records what he told Norman:My plans are not limited solely to obtaining credit. I intend to found a secondcredit bank in addition to the Reichsbank, a bank based entirely on gold. Thisbank will make loans only against bills of exchange, and will give preferentialassistance to those German industries which are able to resume export trade.Supposing for the sake of argument I call this bank the Goldiskontbank (GoldDiscount Bank). 18 [text00013.html#fn18]The “Venetian method” here may not be readily appreciated unless one unpacksSchacht’s scheme a bit. His fundamental problem, it will be recalled, was thatthere was not enough stable liquidity circulating in the German economy, andhence, German exports fell, German industries closed, which resulted in highunemployment. Schacht is stating in effect that to re-open industrial plants(and build new ones), and get stable money circulating again, show hisGolddiskontbank an order for goods, and the bank would make a loan against it.But Schacht’s “Venetian scheme” did not stop there, for he also informed Normanthat this bank would then issue banknotes against its capitalization and thebills on exchange on which its loans were made, and he proposed to do so bydenominating this currency and the issued loans in British pounds sterling! 19[text00013.html#fn19] Norman was, of course, impressed with the idea’sextraordinary nature, for it amounted to more or less a scheme whereby onegovernment allowed another government to issue securities and banknotesdenominated in its own currency. 20 [text00013.html#fn20] Before Norman couldponder this idea too long, Schacht appealed to the Bank of England’s Governor’s“incipient globalism” and explained:“At first glance the idea may strike you as extraordinary. But if a firm ofexporters uses foreign currency in the course of business why should I not useforeign currency in my dealings with them?”Silence again while Norman thought this over.“And just think, Mr. Governor,” I went on, “what prospects such a measure wouldafford for economic collaboration between Great Britain’s World Empire andGermany. If we desire to establish European peace we must free ourselves fromthe limitations imposed by mere conference resolutions and Declarations ofCongress. Economically, the European countries must be more closely linked.Somehow, somewhere, we must make a practical start.”Normal listened with visibly growing appreciation and interest.“You have some very remarkable ideas there Mr. President.” He began to takekindly to my plans; we discussed a whole lot of supplementary questions andproblems. 21 [text00013.html#fn21]Note that Schacht’s plan, like that of the later European Exchange RateMechanism and that of the Monetary Union (or Eurozone) itself, rested upon acurrency scheme.Norman was not to be rushed, however, and requested an adjournment for the daywhile he considered Schacht’s proposal. When the Reichsbank President returnedthe next day, Norman informed Schacht that he had received a communication fromthe large French Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, which, in concert with localGerman banks in the Rhineland, home of Germany’s large industrial combines ofthe Ruhr Valley, was trying to form a local Rhineland central bank issuing itsown banknotes independently of the Reichsbank. It is easy to see what the Frenchmotivation was, for the French were trying to re-stabilize German currency byintroducing their own control over the Rhineland and the heart of Germany’sindustrial strength. This theme of financial and currency warfare betweenGermany and France will be a constant feature of the postwar situation, as weshall see.Schacht’s answer to Norman about this French attempt to gain a measure ofpolitical influence and control over German monetary issue was clear, foralthough the German Government of the short-lived Stresemann Government hadgiven its consent to the plan, Schacht made it abundantly clear to Norman thatthe Reichsbank was opposed to any scheme that sought “to restrict its ownsupreme power in matters of currency within the German Reich.” 22[text00013.html#fn22] Norman pulled British backing from the French scheme,while readily endorsing Schacht’s Golddiskontbank proposal. 23[text00013.html#fn23] The French scheme thus broke on the rocks of theReichsbank, a precedent that we shall see repeated much later, when similarattempts by France to dominate Germany’s currency came to an end by theopposition of an equally cagey Bundesbank President not only to the schemes ofthe French, but to those of his own government. Thus on March 13, 1924,Schacht’s Golddiskontbank came into existence, and, by Schacht’s own admission,it continued “right up to the collapse of Germany in 1945…to the maintenance ofcurrency and to the expansion of German exports.” 24 [text00013.html#fn24]b. The Dawes and Young Plans: Schacht’s Idea for the Bank of InternationalSettlements(1) Hyper-Inflation, The Reichsbank’s Elimination of Currency Speculation, andthe Dawes PlanHowever, Schacht was a busy man, for there was the other matter of Germany’s warreparations to be dealt with. And here, as elsewhere, his and Montagu Norman’sschemes were nothing less than breathtaking. Under the conditions of the Germanhyper-inflation, private currency speculators were quite literally making akilling, namely, the Reichsmark, and hoarding foreign reserves. Here, Schachtshowed his capacity not only for extraordinary solutions, but for breaking therules, even the rulebook of central banks:Once the public loses confidence in a currency, not even the highest rate ofdiscount will scare off speculators. It does not matter if he has to pay ten,twenty or thirty per cent per annum if the value of the currency drops five, tenor fifteen per cent from one month to the next. It was no good thereforeattacking foreign exchange speculators with higher interest rates; we shouldhave to launch an attack on the supply of funds. We decided on a completestoppage of credit to the business community on the part of the Reichsbank. Werealized that such a stoppage would not only be most awkward, to say the least,but that it contained a certain amount of injustice in that it would hit theinnocent as well as the guilty. We comforted ourselves with the thought that thestoppage would not last long but that the exchange situation would return tonormal in the shortest possible time.In order to set the machinery in motion we resorted to a method which hassubsequently often been copied in the political world. On Saturday April 5,1924, after the Stock Exchange had closed, we announced that as from Monday,April 7, the Reichsbank would not increase its total holding in foreign billsand would therefore not accept further bills. That gave the public a day and ahalf in which to familiarize themselves with the announcement.This step was taken in direct contradiction to all the traditional rulesconcerning central banks. It was also probably the first time in economichistory that a central bank deliberately refused to grant credit. 25[text00013.html#fn25]To put this breathtaking measure in a little more concrete—if somewhatinappropriate—analogical perspective, it would be similar to the United StatesFederal Reserve suddenly reversing its “quantitative easings” undertaken in thewake of the 2008 bailouts, and suddenly announcing that it would no longeraccept any foreign currency in its reserves as debt payments, but only dollars.The result would be predictable: the Federal Reserve would suddenly be awash inprecisely those foreign-denominated securities and currencies, as speculatorsunloaded them before the “announced deadline” and took dollars in exchange forthem.This is exactly what happened, for by June 3, 1924, in fifty-seven short days,the Reichsbank had “no less a sum than eight hundred million marks in foreignexchange bills returned” to it. 26 [text00013.html#fn26] The speculators, andtheir deleterious effects on the stability of the Reichsmark, had all but beeneliminated, before the provisions of the Dawes Plan came into effect.(2) The Young Plan, Schacht’s “Supply Side”Scheme, and the Bank forInternational SettlementsThe western Allies, led by American financiers, had forced the Dawes Plan onGermany to insure the flow of reparations payments. As a codicil to this plan,the Reichsbank was forced to accept on its board the seating of an equal numberof Allied representatives in addition to Germans. 27 [text00013.html#fn27]Additionally, the Dawes Committee had “installed reliable confidential agents inthe Reichsbank and other German business establishments” whose job it was “tosee that the reparations installments were punctually remitted.” 28[text00013.html#fn28] Under the terms of the Versailles Treaty and the Dawesplan, Germany had to remit “over two billion German marks annually in foreigncurrency,” 29 [text00013.html#fn29] a sum that, even with Schacht’sextraordinary maneuver against currency speculators, Germany was hardly in aposition to do, without massive foreign borrowing, thus increasing the debtburden on Germany 30 [text00013.html#fn30] and enriching the financiers of thisdebt in the process. As the former Hoover Institute Fellow and scholar AnthonySutton noted,Between 1924 and 1931, under the Dawes Plan and the Young plan, Germany paid outto the Allies about 36 billion marks in reparations. At the same time Germanyborrowed abroad, mainly in the U.S., about 33 billion marks for reparations.Consequently, the burden of German monetary reparations to the Allies wasactually carried by foreign subscribers to German bonds issued by Wall Streetfinancial houses—at significant profits for themselves, of course. And, let itbe noted, these firms were owned by the same financiers who periodically tookoff their banker hats and donned new ones to become “statesmen.” As “statesmen”they formulated the Dawes and Young plans to “solve” the “problem” ofreparations. As bankers, they floated the loans.…Who were the New York international bankers who formed these reparationscommissions?The 1924 Dawes Plan experts from the United States were banker Charles Dawes andMorgan representative Owen Young, who was president of the General ElectricCompany. Dawes was chairman of the Allied Committee of Experts in 1924. In 1929Owen Young became the chairman of the Committee of Experts, supported by J.P.Morgan himself, with alternates T.W. Lamont, a Morgan partner, and T.N. Perkins,a banker with Morgan associations. In other words, the U.S. delegations werepurely and simply…J.P. Morgan delegations using the authority of the UnitedStates to promote financial plans for their own pecuniary advantage. 31[text00013.html#fn31]However, as Schacht, a party to this scheme and certainly a member of thefinancial-capitalist class himself, admits, the Allied Agent for Reparations,Parker Gilbert, realized that the reparations remittances “were not genuine,that the country was paying her debts not with honest export surpluses by withborrowed money.” Under such circumstances “it could only be a matter of how longit would take before Germany was no longer in a position to remit foreigncurrency,” 32 [text00013.html#fn32] or to put the matter more honestly, it wasonly a matter of time before the bankers ran out of money to loan—chargingcommissions, fees, and interest all along the way—so that Germany could repaythem. The “finance capital” solution, in other words, would eventually breakdown under the strain, and consequently, some other solution had to be found.The “solution” came, as it were, in the form of a “pseudo-supply side” answer inthe form of the Young Plan of 1928-1929, and Schacht’s insistence that thereparations could only be genuinely repaid—not with further borrowing andindebtedness—but by actual expansion of German production and hence, exports. Assuch, the Allied “mortgage” on and influence over various German real propertyhad to end: 33 [text00013.html#fn33]Germany was now an impoverished country and no longer able to make loans toothers. If the Allies really wished to help her to meet her reparationsliabilities they should grant loans to the under-developed countries, andthereby put the latter in a position where they would be able to purchase theirindustrial equipment in Germany. No useful purpose would be served by allowingGermany to compete in existing world markets against other European industrialstates as she had hitherto done. German competition in these spheres had beenone of the main factors that had contributed to the end of world peace and toattempted settlement by war. The repetition of such a competitive struggle mustbe avoided, or its bitterness at least reduced by seeking to open many freshmarkets which would afford to all industrial countries opportunities foremployment and for disposal of their goods. Increased well-being of all nationswas the fundamental economic principle by which peace could be preserved andfuture wars avoided. 34 [text00013.html#fn34]In other words, under Schacht’s export-production “supply-side” plan, bydeveloping under-developed countries for German exports of industrial plantsthemselves, the Allies would expand Germany’s economy by making it aworld-export driven economy. The other side of this is, of course, that ifGermany was to be a major supplier of industrial plants themselves, thenGermany’s own already-existing massive heavy industry would be even furtherexpanded. In this, Schacht discloses something highly unusual for a centralbanker, for while most bankers thought in terms of expanding their influencethrough financial-capital alone, Schacht thought not only in such terms, butalso in industrial-capitalist terms.To coordinate all this activity, a new mechanism of international clearing wouldclearly be needed. And once again, it was Schacht who came up with anextraordinary idea, which he pitched to the American chairman of the committee,Owen Young, who had asked Schacht if he had seen any practical way of puttinghis ideas into practical effect. Schacht answered:I should not be telling you all this, Mr. Young, if I were not able to submit apractical proposal for the realization of my object. I would suggest that in theYoung Plan you assume responsibility for all concerned for the joint founding ofa bank through which, on the one hand, the reparations payments shall bedistributed and which, on the other hand, shall be entrusted with the carryingout of financial operations offering to the underdeveloped countries the meansof exploiting their natural resources and increasing their agriculturalproducts. This financial aid will enable these countries to purchase allindustrial equipment — especially in Germany— necessary for increasedproduction. A bank of this kind will demand financial cooperation betweenvanquished and victors that will lead to community of interests which in turnwill give rise to mutual confidence and understanding and thus promote andensure peace. 35 [text00013.html#fn35]Note that Schacht is once again speaking the language of the confidentcapitalist-globalist: but create a “community of economic interests” and warwill be abolished, exactly the same sort of proposition as was advanced by PerJacobssen in his novel, whom, let it be noted, eventually ended up working inSchacht’s creation, the Bank of International Settlements.But Schacht’s globalism—howsoever sincerely he may or may not have believedit—was always (and especially here) couched in terms of the German nationalinterest, for the effect of his international creation was a means to repay thereparations by a massive expansion of the German industrial plant, and bysimilarly large expansion of exports in its overall economy.In a word, Schacht was really asking the Allies to create a monster, one part ofwhich, the enormous I.G. Farben cartel, was already in existence. Thus, it maynot be entirely coincidental that the reaction of the German industrial cartelsto Schacht’s scheme was entirely predictable, for in the view of suchindustrialists—Fritz Thyssen of the enormous Vereinigte Stahlwerke (UnitedSteelworks) cartel—Schacht’s plan amounted to a “pledge of German real assetsfor a gigantic mortgage held in the United States.” 36 [text00013.html#fn36]Their response was equally unusual, for German firms evaded the conditions ofthe Young Plan “by the device of temporary foreign ownership” through foreignholding companies. If this is beginning to sound rather familiar, that’s becauseit is, for precisely the same method was adopted by the Nazis years later aspart of their “strategic evacuation” plan for the survival and eventualreconstruction of Germany. 37 [text00013.html#fn37]Viewed a completely different way, Schacht and the German cartelists aredelivering a one-two punch to the Allied Powers, first by opening the spigots ofAmerican money, and secondly, using that money to create markets for Germanproducts and a vast expansion of the very industrial plant that the Alliedpowers had tried to hem in at Versailles with the war reparations measures.Schacht’s maneuvers, in other words, and his own descriptions of them, shouldnot be taken at face value, for they simply cannot be divorced from the othermeasures occurring at the same time in Weimar Germany, namely, the creation ofthe vast trusts and cartels such as Farben and Thyssen’s Vereinigte Stahlwerkethat would benefit from Schacht’s “Bank of International Settlements,” theplanning for which began in 1929 as representatives of the Allied Powers andGermany gathered to work out the statutes for the new bank. 38[text00013.html#fn38] This brings us at last to the Bank of InternationalSettlements itself.001 [Image00019.gif]Left to right: Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank, Benjamin Strong of the NewYork Federal Reserve, Montagu Norman of the Bank of England, and Charles Rist,of the Banque de France, in New York City, 1927001 [Image00020.gif]Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, Left, and Montagu Norman, Right001 [Image00021.gif]Adolf Hitler and Dr. Hjalmar Schacht2. The Ultimate Insider Trading Mechanism of the Daya. Its Sovereignty and SecrecyThe Bank of International Settlements came into existence on January 30, 1930,when the British, German, Belgian, French, Swiss, Italian and Japanesegovernments signed the document, the “instrument of foundation”. Opening forbusiness on February 27, 1930, it began its financial life with initialcapitalization of 500 million Swiss francs, sold to the members of the centralbanks of the governments founding it in blocks of shares of 2,500 Swiss francs.39 [text00013.html#fn39] Article 10 of its “instrument of foundation” stated oneof the most unusual codicils for any bank, central or otherwise:The Bank, its property and assets and all deposits and other funds entrusted toit shall be immune in time of peace and in time of war from any measure such asexpropriation, requisition, seizure, confiscation, prohibition or restriction ofgold or currency export of import, and any other similar measure. 40[text00013.html#fn40]The central bankers had created a central bank for central banks, and, ineffect, placed it beyond the reach of any law or government; effectively, theBank of International Settlements had been granted the status of a sovereignnation, including the use of diplomatic pouches, and though located in Basel,Switzerland, its buildings are considered “inviolable,” and the Swissauthorities must receive permission before entering it. 41 [text00013.html#fn41]Additionally the actions of its officials and managers are “immune under Swisslaw, for life, for all the acts carried out during the discharge of theirduties,” 42 [text00013.html#fn42] a provision that is almost tantamount to anadmission that their duties will require violations of law.To insure that no Swiss authorities need ever be allowed into the bank, it isequipped with state of the art fire suppression, bunkers, and medicalfacilities. Obsessed with secrecy, there are no minutes of any of its high levelmeetings nor any lists of its participants, although such individuals areallowed to make their own personal notes. 43 [text00013.html#fn43]As was seen in the previous section, Schacht had proposed the bank as a means ofproviding the financial component to his scheme to expand German industry andexports, which in turn was meant to repay Germany’s reparations. But when onecompares this purpose to its chartered activities and, additionally, activitieswhich were prohibited to it, a very different picture emerges. Hungarianresearcher Adam Lebor, who has written virtually the only popular andwell-researched book on the bank, summarizes the permitted activities asfollows:•buying, selling and holding gold for its own account or for the central banks•buying and selling securities other than shares•accepting deposits from central banks•opening and maintaining deposit accounts with central banks•entering agreements to act as a trustee or agent in connection withinternational settlements 44 [text00013.html#fn44]The bank is not permitted, however, to issue banknotes, open any accounts forprivate persons nor for any corporation, nor own any property besides that ofits own headquarters, nor purchase equity shares or to possess any controllinginterest in any commercial enterprise. 45 [text00013.html#fn45]Careful consideration of the chartered activities of the bank will reveal thatthe possibility existed for it to have functioned as a well-connected insidertrading mechanism, 46 [text00013.html#fn46] as is implied by its permittedactivities of being able to accept deposits from and maintain accounts withcentral banks, and to act as a trustee and agent for international settlements.However, perhaps the most revealing of its permitted activities is not simplythe buying and selling of gold, both for itself and as an agent or trustee forother central banks, but its ability to purchase “securities” other than stock.The bank, in other words, could directly purchase bonds, either of corporations,or the sovereign debt of nations, and since the bank could “hold central banks’gold and convertible currency deposits,” 47 [text00013.html#fn47] and yet wasfree of any oversight other than that of the participating banks themselves, thepotential for mischief simply cannot be gainsaid, as will be seen in the case ofCzechoslovakia’s gold shortly. 48 [text00013.html#fn48]It was this ability to hold “gold” along with “convertible currency” depositsfor central banks that gave the Bank its extraordinary power, for this enabledit to maintain accounts in various central banks. Thus, while the actualphysical gold might be held in one central bank, the Bank’s accounts at thevarious central banks, which were sub-divided into sub-accounts representingvarious nations, so that if one central bank wanted to transfer funds toanother, the Bank for International Settlements would instruct the banks holdingactual gold—in practice the Bank of England or the New York Federal Reserve—todebit one account and credit another. 49 [text00013.html#fn49] Similarly, if acentral bank of one country wanted to buy or sell the currency of another, thiscould be handled by the Bank, which did not charge fees for this service. Inthis, the Bank for International Settlements was something completely new on thestage of world finance and clearing, for it was the extension and application toan international scale, for the very first time, of the Venetian banco discritta, the banks of the Rialto that would simply transfer funds from oneaccount to another on ledger books. It was a banco di scritta for central banks,each one of which was also a banco di scritta.But as Czechoslovakia was to discover once the German occupation ofBohemia-Moravia, and the splitting of Slovakia from the Czech republic had beenaccomplished in 1939, The Reichsbank forced the directors of Czechoslovakia’scentral bank, “under the threat of death” 50 [text00013.html#fn50] to issueorders to the Bank of International Settlements to transfer Czechoslovakia’sgold—23.1 metric tons of it!—from its account at the Bank of England to theReichsbank’s account at the Bank of England, and additionally, to transferanother 27 metric tons from its account to the Bank for InternationalSettlement’s account at the Bank of England. 51 [text00013.html#fn51]Naturally the Czechs had hoped that the transfer orders would have been seen ashaving been issued under duress and that the debits and credits to the accountsconcerned would not occur. But as far as the Bank of International Settlementswas concerned, the paperwork was in order. Naturally, Britain’s Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, Sir John Simon, ordered all banks to block Czech accounts, butbecause the Czech gold was held in the “sovereign” Bank of InternationalSettlements accounts, the order to freeze Czechoslovak transactions had noeffect. 52 [text00013.html#fn52] For the sake of the appearance of a legal orderand formality, the Czech gold was in effect robbed.But Schacht, it seems, had yet another card up his sleeve, one which possiblycasts his role into a far different, and much murkier light. On March 6, 1930,barely a little over a week after the BIS had opened its doors for “business,”Schacht presented his letter of resignation from the Reichsbank to the Presidentof the Weimar Republic, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg. The reasons given forhis resignation? A new German government had taken power, one which promisedunilateral revisions to the Young Plan, to which Schacht was opposed. The newgovernment also promised to add a provision to this law that the ReichsbankPresident would be required to join the Bank of International Settlements. Underthe revisions of the Young Plan being proposed, Schacht submitted hisresignation. 53 [text00013.html#fn53]Yet, this same Schacht, who had resigned ostensibly over revisions to the YoungPlan for reparations, now saw fit to undertake a lecture tour in various smallneutral countries, and the United States, for the purpose of creating a climateof opinion favorable for a complete moratorium and suspension of all reparationspayments, a tour which ended with Schacht visiting with President Herbert Hooverfor an hour, during which Hoover “showed himself fully appreciative” of theidea! 54 [text00013.html#fn54] When Hoover suggested in June of 1931, a mere sixmonths after the conclusion of Schacht’s lecture tour, a moratorium on Germanwar reparations payments, “the end of reparations was assured.” 55[text00013.html#fn55] Indeed, the BIS’s role here was highly suspicious, for itestablished a reparations “study committee” headed by a BIS member, AlbertoBeneduce. Beneduce’s committee recommended that reparations be “ ‘adjusted’ toensure peace and economic stability,” a polite euphemism for their completeabolition. In June of 1932, the European governments met in Lausanne, and agreedto cancel all but one final German war reparations payment. 56[text00013.html#fn56]But Schacht’s Frankenstein financial creature, the Bank of InternationalSettlements remained, and this fact, plus the unusual list of activitiespermitted to it and the additional fact of the bank’s “sovereignty” suggeststhat Schacht had completely different purposes in mind for its creation, as isrevealed by the fact that it formed part of his scheme for the expansion ofGerman heavy industry. Indeed, Lebor points out that the American banker, GatesMcGarrah, the first president of the BIS, admitted as much when he stated thatthe mere handling of reparations payments could have been administered by anystandard trust company. 57 [text00013.html#fn57] The implication? The BIS wasreally founded for an entirely different purpose.The question is, what was that purpose?b. The McKittrick Era: The Unpleasant Nazi Reality of the BIS:(1) Walter Funk, the Reichsbank, Money and CartelsThere are two answers to this question, and both are revealed by the subsequenthistory, first, of how the bank was subsequently viewed, and used, by Germany,and then secondly by how it became a template for an even vaster project, thatof the European Union itself. And those two questions are in turn related toeach other, as the history of the BIS during the “McKittrick era” of itsdealings with Nazi Germany illuminates.001 [Image00022.jpg]Thomas Harrington McKittrick (1889-1970), American President of the Bank forInternational Settlements, 1940-1946The “MicKittrick” era was enabled by the way that the Nazis viewed the Bank. Norwas their view unique to them, for there are indications that many within theupper reaches of American finance and industrial capitalism saw it the same way,namely, as a common surface to coordinate the transfer of financial assetsbetween them, even when the nations themselves were at war. But on the Naziside, even this aspect of the Bank’s utility was viewed quite cynically. In1930, one of Hjalmar Schacht’s protégés, the banker Karl Blessing, argued thatbecause the Bank was in fact established to handle a geopolitical and financialproblem, that the Germans present within the Bank’s directorate and staff shouldnot only advance German views at every opportunity. 58 [text00013.html#fn58]Blessing did not stop there, however, but advanced the idea that the Bank shouldbe the object of psychological warfare, of Weltanschaungskrieg or “world viewwarfare,” as the Nazis would later refer to it. Blessing’s recommendation herestrongly suggests the possibility that Schacht’s motivations for midwifing theBank into existence may have been, in part, to create that international “commonsurface” that Germany could exploit for the continuity of its financial andcommercial interests, even in the event of another general war. The methodBlessing proposed was to exploit “the completely utopian objectives of thebank.” 59 [text00013.html#fn59] What did Blessing mean by this?Recall Schacht’s rosy explanation of the purposes of the Bank when he firstpitched the idea to Owen Young: by creating ever wider and more entwined“communities of financial interests” war could be avoided. But those samecommunities of interests, and whatever “common surfaces” they institutionalized,could function equally well as mechanisms of capital and technology transfer,and thus as mechanisms to ensure the continuity of factional interests, namely,German corporate power and interests, should any future war go against Germany.60 [text00013.html#fn60] In this respect, recall that Schacht’s vision is eerilysimilar to that propounded in the Madrid Circular.In any case, Blessing was subsequently in a position to do something about hisrecommendations, for by 1931 he assumed a high level position at the Bank. 61[text00013.html#fn61] Blessing returned to the BIS in 1958, after he had becomePresident of West Germany’s Bundesbank, a fact that indicates the continuity ofinterests, personnel, and policy after the war, which will become more and moreevident as this chapter proceeds.Blessing was not, however, the only high-ranking German, for the BIS quicklybecame a means for the Nazis to maintain close contact with the right-wing ofAmerican high finance.By 1933, Schacht had appointed prominent Cologne banker Kurt Freiherr vonSchröder to the BIS’s board. 62 [text00013.html#fn62] While von Schröder wasnever formally a member of the Nazi Party or its organizations, he wasinstrumental in the financial circles of power that backed Hitler’s rise topower, and was always sympathetic to the Nazis. Indeed, the Schröder Bank’sAmerican division had future American spy-master and Sullivan and Cromwellattorney Allen Dulles on its board, and von Schröder himself sat on the board ofanother bank, J.H. Stein, personal bank of SS Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler, andthe same bank that handled accounts for the “circle of friends” in German highfinance, the Freundeskreis, that provided funds to Hitler. 63[text00013.html#fn63]This intertwining of German high financial and high industrial capital wasrepresented even more directly when the chairman of the board of I.G. Farben,Hermann Schmitz, joined the board of the Bank of International Settlements in1939. 64 [text00013.html#fn64] Other Nazi BIS members included Emil Puhl, thevice-president of the Reichsbank. 65 [text00013.html#fn65](2) The American Component: The Sullivan and Cromwell CircleIt was the American President of the Bank from 1940-1946, Thomas HarringtonMcKittrick, however, who best epitomizes the interlocking factional financialinterests between the USA and Nazi Germany. A close associate of Per Jacobssen,66 [text00013.html#fn66] McKittrick represented that circle of Americanindustrialists and capitalists that were opposed to the RooseveltAdministration’s call for the complete unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany,and who were opposed to Roosevelt’s Treasury Secretary Morgenthau’s plan for thecomplete post-war de-industrialization of the country. Rather, McKittrick,through his contacts with the American financial right wing via Allen and JohnFoster Dulles in the Wall Street firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, was one of thosetrying to negotiate a separate peace with the Nazi regime as late as 1944. Theprincipal concern on both sides of these covert negotiations were to overturnthe Morgenthau plan and to “preserve the industrial substance of the Reich,” asa wartime cable to Allen Dulles put it, again in language eerily similar to theMadrid Circular. 67 [text00013.html#fn67] In this respect, it will be recalledthat the Circular made explicit reference to the use of German-friendly businesscontacts in the USA in order to effect the overthrow of the Roosevelt-Morgenthauplan for the postwar de-industrialization of Germany, contacts which ran largelythrough the Bank of International Settlements.(3) The Bank of International Settlements, the Nazis, and the European UnionAs one might suspect, however, the Roosevelt Administration was not oblivious tothe machinations of McKittrick, the “Sullivan and Cromwell circle,” and theNazis. Here we enter upon another part of the story, one seldom if evercommented upon by researchers, namely, the relationship of the wartime andpost-war Communist cells in the United States to all these machinations, asubject which we will pursue more deeply in Part Three.Here, however, we must touch upon it, for Roosevelt’sTreasury Department did not share the State Department’s enthusiasm forMcKittrick and the BIS. Henry Morgenthau, the Treasury secretary, and hiscolleague, Harry Dexter White, loathed the BIS, seeing it, correctly, as achannel for the perpetuation of Nazi economic interests in the United States.They ensured that the bank was facing ever more obstacles to doing business inthe United States. 68 [text00013.html#fn68]The reason for the opposition should, be now, be obvious, for Morgenthau’sTreasury Department “believed that Swiss banks were being used to transferownership of Italian and German firms to Swiss or American front companies,” 69[text00013.html#fn69] as indeed they were. Thus, in June 1941, the US governmentrevoked all licenses of Swiss banks, including the BIS, from doing business inthe USA, 70 [text00013.html#fn70] which mean the private US banks that wereshareholders of the BIS, JP Morgan 71 [text00013.html#fn71] for example, werenot receiving their dividends. Not surprisingly, McKittrick turned to his oldassociate at Sullivan and Cromwell, John Foster Dulles, to convince the USTreasury Department to release the BIS’s funds. 72 [text00013.html#fn72]It is worth pausing for a moment to consider briefly Henry Morgenthau Jr andHarry Dexter White. Morgenthau was, of course, Jewish, and a close personalfriend of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, and it was Morgenthau who elevatedWhite, also Jewish and a World War One veteran and Harvard economist, to the USTreasury Department. 73 [text00013.html#fn73] Viewed from a certain perspective,then, the conflict between the McKittrick faction, representing the BIS with allits intertwined Nazi and American industrial interests, and the Morgenthau-Whitegroup, could be seen as a struggle between Nazism and “international Zionism,”as certain circles of Nazi propagandists indeed viewed it after the war. Inreality, the real struggle was one between the two militarized socialistideologies of Communism and Nazism and their factions within the Americangovernment. 74 [text00013.html#fn74]Morgenthau and White were, of course, the American representatives to the 1944Bretton-Woods conference that erected the postwar western financial system,including the founding of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.There they both pressed strongly for the abolition of the Bank of InternationalSettlements. 75 [text00013.html#fn75] Harry Dexter White minced no words aboutthe BIS:They hope to be a moderating influence in the treatment of Germany during thepeace conference. That is why Germany has treated it with the greatest of care.She has permitted her to pay dividends; she has let the people of the BIS comeand go across enemy territory; 76 [text00013.html#fn76] she has been extremelycareful and well-disposed to the BIS, because she nursed that baby along in thehope that it would be a useful agency that would protect her interests beyondthose that any other institution around the peace table would. 77[text00013.html#fn77]The BIS, in other words, was to be a key component in the postwarreconstruction—and continuity—plans of the Nazis.Nothing reveals these plans and the continuing interface of the Americanindustrialists and German cartelists as what happened after the war. By thistime, McKittrick’s tenure as BIS president had come to an end, and he had becomea vice-president at Chase National Bank, when he was tapped by Averell Harriman,now in charge of the Marshall Plan to go to work for him in administering theplan! 78 [text00013.html#fn78] Harriman was, of course, closely associated withPrescott Bush of the Union Bank and Trust, the bank interconnected with Germansteel cartelist Fritz Thyssen and whose assets had been frozen by the RooseveltAdministration under the Trading With the Enemy act.More importantly, Harriman was an ardent promoter of the idea of a EuropeanUnion. “Our whole concept,” he would write, “of the unification of Europe wasthat it would first contribute to economic unification. Then we hoped to securean economic-military unity and finally a political unity.” 79[text00013.html#fn79] One wonders why an American diplomat and businessman wouldbe echoing the concepts and war aims of the German elite since General Bernhardiand Chancellor Bettmann-Hollweg! As we shall see shortly, he was also echoingthe far more detailed plans of the wartime Nazi elite itself. In any case, theMarshal Plan aid was also contingent—the Americans insisted—on the Europeansforming a customs union that would lead to “eventual European Union.” 80[text00013.html#fn80] In any case, such a union would benefit Americancorporations trading in Europe; but such a union was also, as we have seen, aclear war aim of the German industrial and military elites prior to World WarOne. It was a clear case of the coalescence of the political and financialinterests of both elites, as the role of John J. McCloy, pre-war American lawyerfor I.G. Farben, and post-war American High Commissioner for Germany, reveal,for it was McCloy who finally persuaded the Truman Administration that enactingthe Morgenthau Plan to de-industrialize Germany would be a strategic mistake.Again, one must wonder, for the Madrid Circular makes it clear that the tacticof persuading the western Allies that such a plan would only mean that Germanywould fall into the hands of the Communists, was the “blackmail diplomacy”method chosen at the end of the war to prevent that fate. The fact that McCloyends up as American High Commissioner for Germany strongly suggests thatinfluence was wielded behind the scenes, influence favorable to the Germancartelists.Like Harriman, who had his own connections to German cartelism, McCloy was aEuropean Unionist. In 1950, in London in a speech titled “Germany in a UnitedEurope,” McCloy—once again, former lawyer for IG Farben and then the AmericanHigh Commissioner for Germany—would state unequivocally: “I say no permanentsolution of the German problem seems possible without an effective Europeanunion.” 81 [text00013.html#fn81]One gains a certain appreciation both for the subtlety and grandiosity of thegame going on, for on the one hand, NATO and a “united European economiccommunity” can be viewed, and sold, as a means of keeping German economic andmilitary power in Europe in check. This was clearly the way that McCloy meanthis British listeners to understand his remarks. But the fact that it is aformer lawyer for I.G. Farben saying them, and that such a union was theconsistent goal of the German financial and political elite all along, meansalso that such a union might not be the ultimate check on German power, but thefulfillment of its consistent ambitions.It should come as no surprise, therefore, that when the western European nationsagreed to accept each other’s currencies for payments in trade via the 1950sEuropean Payments Union that it was the Bank of International Settlements thatwas the appointed agent to handle accounts. It was now the financial clearinghouse for all of Western Europe. 82 [text00013.html#fn82] As for the Nazis, thevarious mechanisms along the road to European union were to be nothing butfronts for an imperium of the German cartels, as indeed former Dutch primeMinister Jelle Zijlstra tirelessly argued. 83 [text00013.html#fn83]Consequently, ever since the establishment of the European Payments Union, theBank of International Settlements “has been at the heart of the Europeanintegration project, providing the technical expertise and the financialmechanisms for currency harmonization.” 84 [text00013.html#fn84]There was yet another role the BIS was to play in the postwar financial world,and it is a role that when viewed from the standpoint of all the factorsswirling around it, raises intriguing speculative possibilities. This was theestablishment in 1961 of the London Gold Pool, to which the USA, Belgium, theNetherlands, France, Italy, West Germany and the United Kingdom all pledged twohundred and seventy million dollars of gold to maintain the gold price of $35per ounce, the price peg of the Bretton Woods agreement. All of this was, ofcourse, deposited with the BIS, which became the principal agent for the pool inconcert with the various central banks. It was, in effect, a BIS “gold cartel”which was constructed and operated “on conditions of complete secrecy.” 85[text00013.html#fn85] Given the BIS’ role in accepting Nazi gold—much of itplundered from Axis conquests in Europe, not to mention literally pried out ofthe teeth of concentration camp victims—one wonders if the BIS might be not onlyat the apex of the public system of central banks, but at the apex of acompletely hidden system of finance, one represented by all the gold-backedbearer bonds scandals of the first decade of the twenty-first century.Now let us pause, and take a very deep breath for…(4) The Indications of a Hidden International System of FinanceLet us assume, for the sake of argument, that The Bank of InternationalSettlements is the principal agent of a hidden bond market representing themovement of vast sums of money completely untraceable to the public system, forconsider, in today’s electronic age, international clearing electronically isultimately accessible to electronic surveillance. The physical movement ofcollateralized bearer bonds, such as the gold-back bearer bonds of the early2000’s bearer bonds scandals, would not be subject to such tracking andsurveillance, permitting a system completely off the books to exist, andrequiring the services of an international clearing house of known secrecy andlack of moral scruples to accomplish it, a bank like the BIS. Such a system, viathe BIS’s diplomatic courtier and privileges, could be used to physically movesuch securities in its diplomatic pouches anywhere on the globe, to fund asecret fusion research project in Argentina, reverse engineer UFOs (Nazi orotherwise) in the American southwest, or, indeed, to build the world’s largestmachine in Switzerland itself, and perhaps eventually an even bigger version ofit in China.Let us assume, further, that for whatever reasons one wished to establish such ahidden system of finance, that the liquidity generated by such a system was notsimply disappearing underground or off planet in an “open system,” but that thesystem is closed upon this planet, and therefore, that whatever liquidity isgenerated must inevitably reappear in the system. The system would, inevitably,betray its existence by massive inflation. So how would one mask its existence?Let us now make another assumption, namely, that the gold-backed “bearer bondsscandals” represent the bonds in this system. Because these are bearer bonds,and denominated in US dollars, such bonds would represent the localconvertibility of such securities in dollars for the funding of such projectsinternationally, for which the US Treasury or the Federal Reserve would beliable. Since the bonds represent trillions of dollars, this would have to bepotentially converted into currency, which would flow into the system and signalthe existence of the hidden system via massive inflation. So again, how wouldone mask its existence? One would initially do so within the constraints of theBretton Woods system by manipulating the price of gold to maintain the price pegas close to $35 per ounce, exactly as indicated. As inflation grew, this pegwould eventually become “unpegged” and the price of gold would move up, butagain, would have to be manipulated and suppressed to the extent possible tomask the system’s existence.But in order to do that one would have to have access to vast amounts of gold,amounts of gold that would similarly have to be kept off the books, in secretaccounts (a practice which, by now, it should be evident that the BIS excelsin). This high speculation may in part answer the question so many have had,namely, with the establishment of the IMF and World Bank, why was the BISallowed to continue in existence? Beyond its role in the mechanisms of EuropeanUnion, it may have a much more covert purpose and role.That this covert purpose and role was to aid and abet the postwar plans andprojects of the Nazi International is at least in part revealed by a transfer onits gold accounts in late March of 1945, as the Third Reich was crumbling, of500,813 kilograms of gold on the accounts of the Reichsbank to the account ofthe Bank of Brazil. As researcher Peter Levenda indicates, “using a conversionvalue of around US $1000.00 per ounce that means this single transaction wouldbe worth today…an amount in excess of seventeen billion US Dollars.” 86[text00013.html#fn86]With this in mind, let us take another deep breath, and consider…C. Buried Bullion and Treasure Trusts: The Continuing Harrowing Adventures ofHjalmar Schacht in Indonesia1. De-Nazifying SchachtThe mere mention of Hjalmar Schacht in connection with Indonesia may seemincongruous, but it is, I believe, a crucial part of this story. As manyresearchers into the phenomenon of postwar organized extra-territorial Nazismhave noted, Schacht was a close friend and associate with SS Lieutenant-ColonelOtto Skorzeny and his Spain-based group of Nazis. 87 [text00013.html#fn87]Levenda, however, draws attention to a very significant point:The Skorzeny-Schacht relationship cannot be over-emphasized, since Schacht hadalways been at pains to present himself as an anti-Nazi —pointing to his briefimprisonment for alleged involvement in the Hitler assassination plot asevidence of his bona fides. However, this episode has been criticizedextensively by investigators who see it as a deliberate attempt to “de-nazify”Schacht in anticipation of the fall of the Reich, so that he would be free tocarry on the mission of resurrecting the German economy after the war. 88[text00013.html#fn88]In this, Schacht may very well have been “sheep-dipped” as a part of theoperation of “de-nazifying” high ranking Nazis by implicating them, and in somecases imprisoning them, for alleged participation in the July 20, 1944 bomb plotagainst Adolf Hitler, exactly as the Madrid Circular astonishingly andexplicitly stated. As was stated in chapter one, some Nazis may have been“executed,” and their grizzly executions “filmed,” in order to convince postwarAllied Nazi hunters that certain individuals were dead. One does not search forpeople that are dead. Other high profile figures such as Schacht were“imprisoned” for their roles in the plot.But whatever the truth or lack thereof of Schacht’s own personal postwardenunciations of accusations of being a Nazi, his actions after the war showremarkable consistency with the pattern observed in previous chapters, andnowhere more so than in his relationship with Indonesia’s “progressive”President Sukarno.2. Schacht and SukarnoOnce Indonesia had gained its independence from the Netherlands, Sukarno servedas its president from 1945 to 1967. But it was his dealings with Schacht withwhich we are concerned, for Sukarno held a series of meetings with the BISfounder and former Reichsbank president in Jakarta in 1951. 89[text00013.html#fn89] From these meetings Sukarno sponsored a conference in 1955called the “Asian-African Conference” in the Indonesian city of Bandung, thepurpose of the conference being to consolidate the Third World nations that didnot wish to align either with the Soviet Union or the United States or theirassociated blocs of alliances. In this, Sukarno was following the “Third Way”positions of Juan Perón in Argentina and later of Libyan dictator MohammarQaddafi, 90 [text00013.html#fn90] and, for that matter, of the Madrid Circular,though it is unlikely Sukarno knew of its existence. But the association withSchacht is all one needs to discern whence the idea may have been germinated.Attendees at the Bandung conference included not only the Grand Mufti ofJerusalem, Al Husseini, uncle to PLO leader Yasser Arrafat, but alsorepresentatives of other Muslim nations and the Muslim brotherhood as well. 91[text00013.html#fn91]Sukarno’s own apparent Axis sympathies during the war were a matter of record,as he had given talks in Tokyo “praising the Japanese and calling for waragainst the Americans and the British as well as the Dutch,” 92[text00013.html#fn92] but these sympathies may only have been mere convenience,as Japanese power may have presented itself to Sukarno as the best availablemeans to overthrow Dutch rule in Indonesia.But Sukarno also had another idea, one that would take the Bandung conferencebeyond mere talk:There was also the idea in the back of Sukarno’s mind of creating aninternational bank that would be the Non-aligned Nations’s (sic) equivalent ofthe World Bank of the IMF—both of which Sukarno viewed as puppets of thesuperpowers and especially of the United States. The creation of such afinancial institution—independent of the World Bank and hence independent ofWestern control—would be viewed by the West with considerable alarm.Who suggested this course of action to Sukarno?…If there were a financial mastermind behind this bold idea of Sukarno, one needlook no further than the same financial mastermind who helped create the bankingstructure and economic power of the Third Reich and who allowed Germany tore-arm in spite of the strictures of the Versailles Treaty: Hjalmar Schacht. 93[text00013.html#fn93]But the Nazi connection, according to Levenda, does not stop there, for Sukarnoapparently intended to capitalize his bank—at least in part—with gold that hadcome to Jakarta from the Bank of Portugal, where it had been held for theaccount of the Organization der Ehemaligen SS Angehöriger, or to give it itsmore notorious name, ODESSA, the infamous postwar Nazi SS organization. 94[text00013.html#fn94]In the context of the Bretton Woods system, what Sukarno was attempting to dowas to establish a parallel international banking and clearing system,independent of Western and American control, in a fashion similar to thecreation of the BRICS development bank and Asia Infrastructure Investment Bankby China today. Perhaps it is also germane to this story to point out thatSchacht, like many Nazis, favored an alliance, not with Imperial Japan, but withNationalist China. 95 [text00013.html#fn95]But Schacht did not stop there, for he was alsoTrying to convince Sukarno that he should create a kind of financial andpolitical Maginot Line out of his archipelago that would provide a bufferagainst the spread of Communism from China and Indochina—one that would thenextend “in a vast Islamic crescent from Australia to the Arab nations of theMideast.” This is a preview of what later would appear as the khalifa orcaliphate dreams of the Islamic fundamentalists of the 1970s, 1980s, and down tothe present day: Islamists who want to create just such an “Islamic crescent”from Southern Thailand, through Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Tostart. To think that this might have been suggested—or at least supported in itsearly stages—by former Nazi Economics Minister Hjalmar Schacht is almostsurreal. 96 [text00013.html#fn96]Or perhaps it isn’t so surreal after all, for as we have seen in previouschapters, the weaponization of radical Islam against the Anglo-Americanfinancial and industrial power interests has been a consistent policy of theGerman financial, military, and industrial elites from the Kaiser’s day down toour own, suggesting once again that perhaps the war on terror is the public faceof a much more deadly and secret war on a postwar “Nazi International”.However, the story does not end there; the murkiest parts are yet to come, andLevenda excels in summarizing them. That part of the story forms a component inthe larger tapestry of stories that have made their way around the internetconspiracy circuits, stories that include the theft of the Soviet Union’s gold,the story of Leo Wanta, the story of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos’ gold, theBlack Eagle trust(a supposed secret gold cartel funding American covertoperations), high financial crimes in connection with the 9-11 events, thebearer bonds scandals, the Japanese plunder of Asia during World War Two knownas Operation Golden Lilly and General Yamashita’s gold. 97 [text00013.html#fn97]This aspect of the story is “Sukarno’s gold.” Here, however, the pattern fits afamiliar story. According to the story, Sukarno knew of, or controlled,…a vast fortune in gold, most of all of which represented the fruits of Japaneseand German war crimes: the seizing of art, jewelry, antiques, as well as gold,and its disposition in hidden places around the world for eventual re-use. Muchof this gold, and art treasure was buried in caves throughout the Philippineislands—where some of it has actually been found—and the rest in other areas ofSoutheast Asia, notably in the Indonesian archipelago. 98 [text00013.html#fn98]This treasure in turn was securitized in the form of “genuine gold certificatesworth billions of dollars at today’s price, certificates representing accountsin foreign banks in the name of Sukarno himself.” 99 [text00013.html#fn99] Withthis, one recognizes the now familiar pattern of the Bearer Bonds Scandalsraising its head once again.But, as Levenda notes, the behavior of banks and governments “when confrontedwith these documents” is bizarre if they are simply counterfeits or forgeries,for the individuals who have presented them are sometimes thrown into prison andthen released without explanation, or simply disappear, or, in some cases, die“under mysterious circumstances.” 100 [text00013.html#fn100]As if all of this were not strange enough, there does appear to be at least somesolid and hard core of truth to the whole matter, for Levenda also observes thateven the New York Times reported in 1997 that some forty tons of Nazi goldsomehow made it both to China and Indonesia, out of a shipment of some fourhundred tons of gold, though nothing is known of what happened to the otherthree hundred and sixty tons! 101 [text00013.html#fn101] Nor was this the onlymedia exposure to the Sukarno gold, for The Straits Times of Singapore ran astory on January 24, 1987, that stated that the Sukarno government had depositedmillions of dollars in 1960 into the Union Bank of Switzerland. 102[text00013.html#fn102] The article also notes that Sukarno intended this to beused for a “revolutionary fund” to help build Indonesia’s infrastructure, whichsuggests that he also intended it to function as backing for a currency.The story takes an even stranger turn from there, for one of the Americans sentto Indonesia in the 1950s, apparently in an effort to disrupt Sukarno’s plans,was none other than Lee Harvery Oswald(!), 103 [text00013.html#fn103] whose ownconnections with the Nazi International may have been via Dallas White Russianémigré and oilman, George de Mohrenschildt, a man with his own possibleconnections to the Nazi International via German General Reinhard Gehlen’sBundes-nachrichtendiest. 104 [text00013.html#fn104]At this juncture Levenda makes a crucially important observation not only on themotivations of President Sukarno, but on those of the financial elites thatwould wish to keep the existence of the Nazi and Japanese loot a secret. HereLevenda not only speaks directly to the problematic, but implies the existenceof the speculative hidden structure summarized in the previous section, and itis hence necessary to cite his deeply penetrating remarks at length:Revealing the existence of the gold could cause serious repercussions in worldfinancial markets. If enough gold was suddenly dumped on the banks the price ofgold would plummet, and the value of the gold reserves of the United States andother countries would be cut dramatically, plunging the world into economicchaos. The gold would then have to be handled discretely. It would have toremain hidden, and the shares of the gold sold like government bonds. Some ofthe gold could be taken out of hiding and shipped to banks abroad forsafe-keeping and as collateral for the certificates, but there would always bethe problem that the banks could not be trusted and would in the end deny thatthe gold ever existed. 105 [text00013.html#fn105]Succinctly put, the existence of such quantities of bullion and other hardassets such as jewels, virtually guarantees the emergence of a hidden system offinance, complete with its architecture of gold-backed bearer bonds, and banksthat maintain that there is no such system nor such amounts of gold. The articlein The Straits Times of Singapore, in other words, may be virtually the onlypublic glimpse of this system until the Bearer Bonds Scandals a little over twodecades later.Moreover, there’s even another connection between the Sukarno gold story, andthat of the wider Bearer Bonds scandals, and this is its resemblance to the “57sbonds” scheme of Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka. Faced with bonds coming tomaturity, and not having the money in the Ministry of finance to redeem them,Tanaka hit upon the brazen scheme to “swap paper” with the bondholders byissuing the so-called “57s” bonds, so named because of their issuance in thefifty-seventh year of the reign of Emperor Hirohito. These bonds, however, wereabsolutely unique in their design and did not resemble any previous Japanesesovereign securities, and, additionally, were bearer bonds issued with uniqueand deliberately designed flaws, such as misspellings and other “errors” thatwould allow the Japanese government to denounce them as forgeries orcounterfeits should anyone attempt to redeem them. And even if redeemed, theJapanese Government could pretend it was only doing so out of some sort of“compassion,” and do so at a tremendous discount to the bondholder. 106[text00013.html#fn106]Here, once again, it is necessary to cite Levenda’s penetrating analysis of theSukarno “gold documents” and their enormously important implications:The certificates are quite unusual in design and execution, and seem to argueagainst being hoaxes by virtue of the fact that there are very clearlytypographical errors that seem intentional. For instance, a certificate can bebeautifully printed on heavy, embossed paper with a flurry of stamps andsignatures—all perfect and verifiable—as well as account numbers and otherdetails concerning the value of the certificate. Then, oddly after all of thiswork, the name of the beneficiary will be deliberately misspelled. Ironically,this is considered proof that the certificate is genuine. This is because aclever forger would not have made the mistake of misspelling the beneficiary’sname. In order to guarantee the authenticity of the certificate, the name wouldbe slightly misspelled as a kind of coding system, verifying that thecertificate was genuine. It seems counter-intuitive but then the bestcryptography often is. 107 [text00013.html#fn107]Note the crucial significance of what is actually being stated here, for this isthe second example of a sovereign government issuing such securities withdeliberately executed errors, and thus it raises the probability that theyrepresent something real that is occurring on a highly covert and secret levelwithin the western international banking and financial system.Levenda zeros in on one aspect of the problem they thus pose:This is the essential problem: these are not bearer bonds or bank checks, oreven personal checks. These are basically statements that such funds exist, thatthey have the requisite account numbers, and that the banks verify that thesefunds exist. In essence, the bank acts as a witness to the existence of the goldor cash—and will act as a kind of intermediary in some future transaction thatis covered by an arcane and complex set of rules that were established at thetime the accounts themselves were established. Similar to the idea of a Swissbank account that can be numbered and anonymous, but accessed by a person withthe right codewords or code numbers, these documents can only by negotiated bythe people or agencies—commonly referred to as “trustees” but sometimes, as inthe Sukarno case, as “gurus”—listed in the documentation attached to thecertificates. 108 [text00013.html#fn108]To put it as bluntly and “country simple” as possible, fraud in the form ofdeliberate errors and an arcane procedure for moving monies via such instrumentshas been made the operative “business model” of the system. Levenda himselfsummarizes the effect of all of this by pointing out that this is a clearindicator of a vast hidden and entirely secret system of finance:One problem with this entire story of gold certificates worth trillions ofdollars is that the instruments themselves are unique. They are not normalbanking instruments, but instead were created for a special purpose: to controlthe movement and ownership of the large stores of gold and other valuables thatwould be held outside the standard banking channels and used only by and for aselect group of insiders. 109 [text00013.html#fn109]And as I have pointed out on numerous occasions in reference to the Bearer BondsScandals, why would anyone go to the enormous effort and expense of creatingsuch a massive hoax, running it time and time again, with little prospect ofever redeeming any of these certificates even at extremely sharp discount, ifthere were no reality behind them? 110 [text00013.html#fn110]Levenda sees the exact same problem, and states it in almost exactly the sameterms:More smoke? More mirrors? There is so much documentation available on thesecases—from hundreds of pages of signed and sealed bank statements,official-looking documents from government agencies, and the certificatesthemselves—that it seems the hoax (if such it is) is truly massive in scale, andyet with very little payback. No bank, no government, seems willing to verifythe authenticity of these documents. If it is a hoax, then why? Who is beinghoaxed and to what extent? And why would someone go to all the trouble ofcreating beautifully designed and printed bank certificates only to misspell thenames of the beneficiaries in childish ways? And why are those in possession ofthese documents being sentences to lengthy prison terms, far out of proportionto their crimes? 111 [text00013.html#fn111]To close this circle of high strangeness surrounding the story of the Sukarno“gold documents” more completely, Levenda mentions one, final, highlytantalizing piece of information. As the Japanese Empire began its blitz throughAsia and the Western Pacific, the colonial powers of the area began to ship asmuch of their gold from their colonies as they could, and this included theUnited States, which shipped gold from the Philippines to the USA via Hawaii.The military officer in charge of this operation was then Major General CharlesWilloughby, who was General Douglas MacArthur’s intelligence chief throughout,and after, World War Two. 112 [text00013.html#fn112]But Willoughby was also a member—along with Lt. Col. Philip Corso of The DayAfter Roswell fame—of a secret society called the Shickshinny Knights of Malta.113 [text00013.html#fn113] Lt. Col. Corso, it will be recalled, had at one pointbeen involved in the security vetting of Nazi scientists being brought to theUSA as part of Operation Paperclip. Willoughby had his own German connection,for he was in fact, German. Charles Willoughby was not even his real name,having been born Adolf Karl von Tscheppe-Weidenbach in Heidelberg in 1892, theson of a German baron and an American mother. He changed his name to CharlesWilloughby when he immigrated to the USA. Because of this German heritage,MacArthur referred to him as his “pet fascist.” 114 [text00013.html#fn114] Itwas Willoughby who oversaw, for MacArthur, the recovery of Japanese loot in thePacific, and additionally, who maintained close ties to General FranciscoFranco’s government in Nationalist Spain, and with Texas oil magnate H.L. Hunt.115 [text00013.html#fn115] Hunt in turn maintained close intelligence contactswith General Reinhard Gehlen’s Bundesnachrichtendienst ” 116[text00013.html#fn116] —probably through “White Russian,” but in reality,Russo-German émigré George de Mohrenschildt—facts which raise the question ofwhether or not Willoughby ever completely shed his allegiance to Germany or if,indeed, he was a deep-cover agent all along.But while the Nazis were transferring vast amounts of money via the BIS out ofEurope, and fomenting, via a “de-nazified” Schacht who nevertheless somehowmanaged to maintain close contact with other Nazis after the war, what were theydoing inside Europe? What exactly were their detailed plans for a “Europeanfederation”? This is where, as researcher Adam Lebor put it, the truths are bothuncomfortable and unspoken, because “the parallels between the plans of the Nazileadership for the postwar European economy and the subsequent process ofEuropean monetary and economic integration are real.” 117 [text00013.html#fn117]The devils are always, however, in the details, and in this case, the detailsare devils.D. Molecule Monopoly and the Transhumanism Tango: Uniting Europe, Patent byPatentThe pattern of consistent objectives that was discovered in chapter two—theGerman war aims during both World Wars of creating a European customs union—ismirrored by a consistent pattern of Nazis or Nazi-connected individualsconnected with the planning and implementation of such a union after the war,and behind them, one is also able to discern the now-familiar pattern of“cartelization.” It is when one considers the detailed plans of the Nazis forsuch a union that these parallels become not only deep, but highly disturbing.For example, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the notorious Nazi governor of theNetherlands during World War Two who was sentenced to hang by the Nuremberg WarCrimes Tribunal after the war, stated that the should be a Europeanfederation—under German leadership of course—“above and beyond the concept ofthe nation-state,” a federation that “once national barriers are removed” wouldallow increased trade and movement of capital and goods thus increasing thecontinent’s prosperity. 118 [text00013.html#fn118] One must note that the memeof the obsolescence of the “nation-state,” a familiar article of the globalists’credo, a meme that might moreover seem contradictory to the Nazis’ extremenationalism, is in fact quite consonant with the Nazi creed of the Führerprinzipand the “People” (das Volk) as a kind of mystical religious entity of its own.It was, after all, not the nation that was part of the familiar Nazi invocation“Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer” (One People, One Federation, One Leader), butprecisely the Reich, the federation, the commonwealth, the Empire.Schacht’s successor at the Reichsbank, Walter Funk, wrote papers during theSecond World War advocating the postwar creation of a European “large-uniteconomy,” including an idea of a “Reichsmark” zone that would eventually lead tothe creation of a common currency given the application of a “suitable monetarytechnique.” 119 [text00013.html#fn119] This staged introduced of a commoncurrency after first creating an “economic zone” based on German currency was,as we shall see in the next chapter, precisely the staged plan that was followedafter World War Two in the creation of the Eurozone, following the establishmentof the Exchange Rate Mechanism that was, predictably, based on the West GermanDeutschmark:Funk’s analysis and prediction are unstettlingly (sic) prescient of thesubsequent course of postwar European economic and political history. TheReichsmark would be the dominant currency, and once it had been freed of foreigndebt, its currency area must “continue to widen.” Bilateral payments must betransformed into multilateral economic transactions and clearing arrangements,“so that the various countries may enter into properly regulated economicrelations with one another through the intermediary of clearing arrangements ofthis kind” —just as happened with the 1947 Paris agreement on multilateralpayments and its succession mechanisms, such as the European Payments Union(EPU).” 120 [text00013.html#fn120]Careful reading of Funk’s proposals indicate the presence of the BIS modelhovering over the whole scheme, namely, of an international payments andclearing system and bank dominated by Germany through the dominant position ofits currency. This, again, will become particularly apparent once we turn toconsider the Exchange Rate Mechanism—the final step toward the euro—in the nextchapter.Perhaps no one, however, is in a better position to understand the resemblanceof the structure of the European Union and its many parallels with the wartimeaims of Germany through the two World Wars, and the role of the large Germanchemicals combines in its construction, than the Germans themselves. Germanphysician Doctor Matthias Rath has appeared in numerous conferences along withother speakers in Germany and Poland, attempting to raise people’s awareness onthis topic, and not without consequences to himself, as he has faced numerouslawsuits from the medical and pharmaceutical corporations for his assertions.Rath, along with co-authors Paul Anthony Taylor, Aleksandra Niedzwiecki, andAugust Kowalczyk, has authored an important small book, whose importance isbelied by its few pages: Die Nazi-Wurzeln der Brüsseler EU (The Nazi Roots ofthe Brussels EU), which lays bare the participation of leading Nazi and pro-Nazisympathizers and theorists in the formative years and structures that led totoday’s European Union.Rath and his co-authors propose two theses, which have been followed throughoutthis book:1)Following the conclusions of the Allied investigators and the Americanprosecutors at the Nuremberg Tribunal, Rath first assumes that World War Twowould not have been possible without the large German chemicals firms, i.e.,impossible without the I.G. Farben chemicals cartel; 121 [text00013.html#fn121]and,2)World Wars One and Two were really the first and second attempts by thiscartel and the firms comprising it, to unify Europe by the force of German arms,122 [text00013.html#fn122] and once unified, thence to dominate the world.Viewed from the perspective of these chemical firms and the Farben cartel thatthey comprised, the Second World War in particular was a war to establish thecartel’s dominance and control of the billions of dollars market in chemicals,petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. 123 [text00013.html#fn123]To these theses, Rath adds a third:3)The same chemicals cartel and Nazi personnel planned and staffed theinstitutions of the European Union, and hence, the European Union constitutesbut another attempt by the same corporate interests to dominate Europe and, bycreating a third major “superpower,” the world. 124 [text00013.html#fn124] Putdifferently, the same power structure as lay behind the Nazis, is masked by theEuropean Union. Indeed, the European Union and its lack of genuinely democraticstructures is no accident, argues Rath, for its structures and policies arenothing but the realization of Nazi plans for a European federation, or rather,a European Reich, with the EU and its bureaucracies being nothing but a“politburo” for the large German chemical concerns. 125 [text00013.html#fn125]1. The Patent Principle and the Molecule Monopoly:a. Dr. Walter HallsteinRath zeros in on a fundamental problematic: how could democratic nations, somewith a long tradition of it such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom,create the European Union, 126 [text00013.html#fn126] where the so-calledparliament has no legislative power, and where all “law” is determined by anunelected commission whose members are appointed by the member nations? Theanswer, as suggested by all that has preceded, is that the European Union isless the creation of its member nations, and more the creation of the largechemicals cartels, 127 [text00013.html#fn127] in conjunction with other largeEuropean corporations.Here, however, the devils are once again in the details, and these devils arenot only Nazis, but Nazi attorneys, and the method of expanding the cartelinterests and power was by patent law. Indeed, for the Nuremberg War CrimesTribunal, patents were not only a means for the Farben cartel and itsconstituent corporations to bypass national political control, they played thekey role and were the principal method 128 [text00013.html#fn128] by whichFarben expanded its power across the continent in the wake of Nazi conquests. Inthis context, Rath points out a significant detail seldom appreciated, for theterm “Grossdeutschland” —Greater Germany—became a code word both for the NaziParty and its cartel backers. The public meaning of the term was plain enough,for it simply meant the outright annexation of territories adjacent to the Reichonce the Wehrmacht had conquered them. But for the Nazis and the chemicalscombines, it had an additional, more secretive and insidious meaning. For them,Grossdeutschland expressed not so much the territories actually formally annexedto the Reich, but rather the regions over which their “jurist-Stormtroopers” 129[text00013.html#fn129] were engaged in homogenizing and harmonizing the patentlaws of conquered countries with those of Germany. In effect, they were creatinga body of law for all of Europe.At this juncture, Rath and his co-authors focus upon a little-known, but hugelysignificant speech given by one of these attorneys-cum-legal theorists onJanuary 24, 1939, barely nine months before the outbreak of World War Two. Thespeech, Grossdeutschland als Rechtseinheit —“Greater Germany as a Legal Unity”130 [text00013.html#fn130] —was given by Prof. Dr. Walter Hallstein, a professorof law at the University of Rostok, and, as will be seen shortly, a massivelyimportant figure in the postwar creation of “European institutions,” to such anextent that he made justifiably be considered one of the “founding fathers” ofthe European Union.001 [Image00023.jpg]Prof. jur. Dr. Walter Hallstein (1901-1982)In this “hegemony speech,” Hallstein outlines part of the Nazi-Cartel blueprintfor a United Europe, and indeed may be viewed as “the best example” of howconsistently this European chemicals interest has pursued its intereststhroughout the decades since the war. 131 [text00013.html#fn131] One may viewthese detailed principles as a “weaponization of law” and in particular, of alllaws having to do with corporations and patents. The speech, laden with phrasessuch as “a large type of complete planning,” 132 [text00013.html#fn132] and the“creation of a new law” 133 [text00013.html#fn133] is concerned with theconstruction of a “law of Nature,” 134 [text00013.html#fn134] that is to saw anew kind of “scientific law” not dependent on the typical legal methods ofanalogical reasoning, but one based on observation, and modification, andownership, that is to say, patents. 135 [text00013.html#fn135] On this basis,law can be extended to the whole “large space economy” (a term with which weshall be preoccupied shortly) through a “general overhaul of entire areas oflaw.” 136 [text00013.html#fn136]This was not all, however, as Hallstein had specific proposals for this overhaulof law that included:1)“foundational” or constitutional laws against the rebuilding of politicalparties in Europe;2)“foundational” or constitutional laws for the security of the unity of theParty and the State, in other words, the complete subordination of all officesand agencies of the State by the Nazi Party;3)“foundational” or constitutional laws for the construction of a New, i.e.,European, Reich;4)A “Reich State Officer Holder Law,” regulating the holders of any office atthe Reich or “federal” level.To ensure the implementation of these draconian ideas, Hallstein proposed aseries of offices that amounted to the implementation of a “commissar” systemreporting ultimately to the Führer and bypassing institutions of local andregional government. Note what Hallstein was doing was not proposing theabolition of local or regional governments, but rather, a system ensuring thatthose governments would remain in compliance with regulations of the Reich.Regulation was to become normative law, not legislation. Thus the Party, weddedto the cartel, was the true leadership of a “völkisch State” and the thus itfell to National Socialism to secure the means of “commonality,” 137[text00013.html#fn137] both in law, and in its practice.In other words, not only was a European federation under German leadership aNazi goal, but one of the chief ways to implement it, as laid out in Hallstein’s“hegemony speech,” was to homogenize law on the principle of the union betweenpolitical parties and the corporate or cartel interest, which then in turnimplements a commissar system, not abolishing local or regional governments, butin parallel to them. Laws as not so much overturned as regulated by these“commissars” from the top down. Obviously, in such a system there is little realpopular or democratic participation, for the normal institutions and mechanismsof government have been reduced to a kind of theatrical agent of a political andcartel party interest. Thus, for Hallstein and the Nazi-Farben legal theorists,yet another “codeword” is created from normal human usage, for phrases or wordssuch as “the mother state” or “the state” or “government” meant precisely thesovereignty of the Party-cartel coalition or marriage itself, not thesovereignty of the people nor of a government or state (in the normal sense)representing them. 138 [text00013.html#fn138] “Thus,” Hallstein would state inhis Hegemony Speech, “for the Greater German Reich, the legal unity 139[text00013.html#fn139] is not a happenstance that results from the creation ofthis realm, but its task.” 140 [text00013.html#fn140]Hallstein’s vision, when carefully considered, also reveals itself to be asubtle study in the application of political dialectic to accomplish a goal.Indeed, in Hallstein one can perceive the Hegelian dialectic in its “right” wingFascist form as opposed to its more well-known “left wing” or Marxistapplication. But like its Marxist counterpart, the Hallstein version has thesame three principle steps of (1) thesis, (2) antithesis, and (3) synthesis.Consider the staged application of these three steps:1)Nazi Thesis: create a brutal repressive tyrannical system of a nationalisticbase with no widespread popular support outside of Germany;2)Democratic Antithesis: create wartime underground opposition and postwarpopular social democracies opposed to that regime 141 [text00013.html#fn141] togive a measure of trans- European opposition, thus creating a rudimentary“European” cultural identity and institutions;3)European Union Synthesis: the creation of a European bureaucratic superstate,modeled on Hallstein-Nazi principles, but masked behind the theater ofdemocratic institutions.While these steps may not be immediately clear when one considers merely thissummary of Hallstein’s Hegemony Speech, they do become completely clear once oneconsiders his very prominent postwar activity in aid of the formation of“European institutions.”001 [Image00024.gif]Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and Walter Hallstein at the Signing of the Treaty ofRome, 1957Indeed, Hallstein became one of postwar West Germany’s most ardent“Europeanists,” and a consistent advisor and confidant of Germany’s postwarChancellors, from Adenauer to Brandt. He attended the signing of the Treaty ofRome in 1957, establishing various European institutions including the EuropeanCommission, co-signing the instrument with Chancellor Adenauer, and became itsfirst President in 1958, a post which he held steadily until 1967. 142[text00013.html#fn142] It should be noted, at this juncture, that with thesealing of the Rome-Berlin Axis in 1938, that Fascist Italy and Nazi Germanyestablished the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für deutsch-italienische Rechtsbeziehungen,the Labor Society for German-Italian Legal Coordination, a bureau designed tobring German and Italian law, particularly law dealing with labor relations,corporate law, and patents, into harmonization. 143 [text00013.html#fn143] Thus,it should come as no surprise that one discovers these principles not only beingenunciated in Hallstein’s 1939 “Hegemony Speech” but that Hallstein himself wasintimately involved in these processes, being one of the German signatories to,and representatives on, the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, 144[text00013.html#fn144] creating the first European “common market” in coal andsteel. As a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1957, and as President of theEuropean Commission from 1958-1967, Hallstein was also instrumental inoverseeing not only the establishment of Euratom, whose associated organizationCERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire) is well-known, but insteering its implementation during his tenure as European Commission President.145 [text00013.html#fn145] Nor should it come as any surprise that Hallstein’sproposals for a kind of “commissar” system in his 1939 “Hegemony Speech” alsofound their way into the mechanisms established by the Treaty of Rome with theappearance of European “commissioners.”001 [Image00025.jpg]Walter Hallstein and Chancellor Willi BrandtHow did Hallstein manage to become such a prominent “Europeanist” within theGerman government after the Second World War, and later, a prominent figure inthe first European wide institutions, given his Nazi past? Very simple: heconcealed his membership in various Nazi organizations, and ensured that his“numerous publications and lectures, as champion of the NationalSocialist-cartel cause to dominate Europe, were destroyed.” 146[text00013.html#fn146]b. Arno SalterDr. Hallstein was not, however, the only Nazi legal theorist working on theproblems of a European-wide German-led federation. Indeed, the idea of such afederation was such a central and crucial component of the postwar plans of theNazis and the Farben cartel, that a “Central Research Institute for NationalEconomic Order and ‘Large Space Economy’” 147 [text00013.html#fn147] was foundedin Dresden to study the issue of postwar European integration. 148[text00013.html#fn148] Under the aegis of this institute, jurist and economistArno Sölter published a book in 1941 whose title says it all: DasGroßraumkartell: ein Instrument der industriellen Marktordnung in einem neuenEuropa, or The Large-Space Cartel: An Instrument of Industrial Organization ofthe Market in a New Europe, a work whose parallels with the modern EuropeanUnion Rath characterizes as “breathtaking.” 149 [text00013.html#fn149] ForSölter and his Farben-Nazi masters, the “large space” or Großraum meant all ofEurope, including European Russia, 150 [text00013.html#fn150] which, when thebook first appeared, it looked like the Wehrmacht would be successful inconquering, as Operation Barbarossa, Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union, hadjust begun, and the Red Army was being systematically and operationallyliquidated in the field. The “large space” referred to was thus a code word for“Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals,” a concept with which we shall have tobe concerned in a subsequent chapter. 151 [text00013.html#fn151]It is when one reads Sölter’s book that one discovers the detailed structuralforerunners for “what would later become the structure of the European Union.”152 [text00013.html#fn152] Sölter’s statements are indeed breathtaking:We recall the hierarchy of the ordering of the market: State—Economicunion—Cartel, which we have established for the “Large Space Cartel.” In thiscontext, for the moment we ignore the state’s responsibility in the areas ofeconomic and political “safeguarding” within the “Large Space Cartel”. Instead,we want to focus ourselves more on the detail of the problem of the organizationof a European market from the perspective of the cartel and later the problem ofeconomic policy of the state that affect inevitably the principles of marketregulation of the entire area of the Large Space Cartel. Directly responsiblefor the metropolitan area is the “Cartel Economic Group,” whosemarket-regulating functions we want to see enclosed in a “Cartel Bureau”. 153[text00013.html#fn153]Sölter goes on to state that the “Cartel Bureau” should have regional offices,all answerable to a Central Cartel Bureau, which is responsible for anti-trustoversight (!) and to ensure that there are no duplications of effort within the“large space.” 154 [text00013.html#fn154] This central cartel bureau would be“the highest regulatory authority” 155 [text00013.html#fn155] responsible forestablishing financial and economic policy.Notice that what Sölter is proposing is the expansion of the Farben-Nazicoalition to European-wide scale, for the Cartel Bureau that Sölter has in mindis the Farben office in Berlin, which functioned as the liaison between thecartel headquarters in Frankfurt and the Nazi Reich government in Berlin. Thispower structure is expressed in a hierarchy of three elements: (1) the Stateitself (at the lowest level), (2) the economic union or unity (the Reich in itssense of “commonwealth,” and finally, hiding behind it all, (3) the cartelitself. That this is the intended ordering of this hierarchy is revealed by thefact that Sölter makes his central cartel bureau the “highest regulatoryauthority” in a European-wide federation. For Rath, this is exactly mirrored inthe structure of the European Union, for the European Commission rules viaregulatory pronouncements through its “Permanent Directory” of regulatoryedicts. Nothing becomes law, notes Rath, unless it is published in thisdirectory. 156 [text00013.html#fn156] And note again, the people publishingthese regulatory edicts are not popularly elected, but appointed by theirgovernments. Recalling Sölter’s hierarchy, this means that the Commission issimply the public regulatory face of internationalized corporate interests. 157[text00013.html#fn157] In effect, Sölter’s Central Cartel Bureau was the edificecreated to accomplish and effect the harmonization and homogenization of law viaregulatory edict, thus bypassing national or regional parliamentary assemblies;it was, so to speak, the “weaponization of the doctrine of the corporateperson.”It should come as no surprise, then, that one encounters the doctrine of thecorporate person in this “weaponized” form as representing the spiritual powerof the cartel-party coalition in Hallstein’s “Hegemony Speech,” where he speaksof the “personhood of the People,” a massive reduction of the population of thenation to one group corporate person. 158 [text00013.html#fn158] By so extendingthe doctrine of corporate personhood to the extent of the entire nationalpopulation, a tremendous reduction of the individual person is accomplished,and, if one recalls the theological origins of the doctrine, the legalculpability of the individual person for the actions of the corporate group islikewise assured.’ 159 [text00013.html#fn159]Europe “from the Atlantic to the Urals” was to be one gigantic cartel andcorporate super-state. And, let us again reiterate, this was the consistent waraim of the German political, military, and corporate elite since World War One.The presence of so many influential Nazis, not only in the postwar government ofWest Germany, but also in the creation and implementation of postwar structuresin the European Union, and the consistent parallels of present European Unionstructures with the ideas of the Nazi-Farben cartel coalition during the SecondWorld War are there for all to see. Thus, in answer to the question of “where isthe Nazi International now, and what might it be up to,” one need look nofarther than the European Union itself. 160 [text00013.html#fn160]But in order to reach that goal, one not only had to harmonize and homogenizelaw, but the currencies of the nations as well, to make possible the creation ofone currency. One had to create, in effect, a “currency cartel” capable of the“regulation and ordering” of currency markets to transition to a singlecurrency. It is to that aspect of the story we now turn.001 [Image00026.gif]Chancellor Helmut Kohl (1982-1998) At a Christian Democratic Union Party meetingin the early 1980s.001 [Image00027.gif]Chancellorin Angela Merkel1 [text00013.html#fn_1] Adam Lebor, Tower of Basel: The Shadowy World of theSecret Bank that Runs the World (New York: Public Affairs, 2013), p. 220.2 [text00013.html#fn_2] Bernard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe: The DirtyWar for Europe’s Money (London: Faber and Faber: 1995), p. 10, emphasis in theoriginal.3 [text00013.html#fn_3] Hjalmar Schacht, Confessions of the Old Wizard: TheAutobiography of Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht (Cambridge, Massachusetts:Houghton Mifflin Company, 1956), p. 85.4 [text00013.html#fn_4] Ibid., p. 1.5 [text00013.html#fn_5] “Peter Oldfield,” The Alchemy Murder (New York: IvesWashburn, Publisher, 1929), pp. 179-183, emphases added.6 [text00013.html#fn_6] For many people this idea is often articulated inconjunction with another, namely, that the “power elites” are under some sort ofrule or “moral law” that they must disclose their intentions, howsoevercovertly, before proceeding with them.7 [text00013.html#fn_7] Adam Lebor, The Tower of Basel, p. 52.

This meant that debts which had been incurred in goldmarks could be paid by means of equal nominal amounts in debased paper marks. Inaddition, the agricultural community used their paper marks to purchase asquickly as possible all kinds of useful machinery and furniture—and many uselessthings as well.” (Hjalmar Schacht, Confessions of the Old Wizard, p. 163,emphasis added)11 [text00013.html#fn_11] Hjlamar Schacht, Confessions of the Old Wizard, p.169.12 [text00013.html#fn_12] Ibid., p. 163.13 [text00013.html#fn_13] Ibid.14 [text00013.html#fn_14] Hjalmar Schacht, Confessions of the Old Wizard, p.164.15 [text00013.html#fn_15] Ibid.16 [text00013.html#fn_16] Though in this case not being used, at least overtly,to back currency.17 [text00013.html#fn_17] See my Covert Wars and Breakaway Civilizations, pp.36-43.18 [text00013.html#fn_18] Hjalmar Schacht, Confessions of the Old Wizard, p.181, emphasis added.19 [text00013.html#fn_19] Hjalmar Schacht, Confessions of the Old Wizard, p.182.20 [text00013.html#fn_20] There may be a possible connection here to the laterNazi counterfeiting of pound sterling notes during the SS’s Operation Bernhard,though as of this writing, I have found no direct evidence of such a connection.21 [text00013.html#fn_21] Schacht, op. cit., pp. 182-183.22 [text00013.html#fn_22] Hjalmar Schacht, Confessions of the Old Wizard, p.184.23 [text00013.html#fn_23] Ibid., pp. 186-187.

It could, ofcourse, be easily argued that this was not merely a sentimental or rhetoricalexpression or action on the part of the Allied and Associated Powers, for by theearly 1930s, the radical parties of the left and right inside Germany, Communismand Nazism, were indeed in their own respective ideological ways challenging thewhole structure of western political and financial order. The Nazis, of course,used the issue of the Versailles Treaty with its reparations, war guilt, anddisarmament clauses as the symbol of this system. By thus demolishing one of themost onerous provisions of the Treaty the Allied powers may have been hoping torob the radical parties inside of Germany of their political platforms.57 [text00013.html#fn_57] Ibid., p. 42.58 [text00013.html#fn_58] Adam Lebor, Tower of Basel, p. 27.59 [text00013.html#fn_59] Ibid., p. 28.60 [text00013.html#fn_60] Lebor himself makes this very same observation: “Theinternational stage, banking networks, and legitimacy the BIS provided, first tothe Reichsbank and then to its successor banks, has helped ensure the continuityof immensely powerful financial and economic interests from the Nazi era to thepresent day.” (Adam Lebor, Tower of Basel, p. xix, emphasis added)61 [text00013.html#fn_61] Adam Lebor, op. cit., p. 28.62 [text00013.html#fn_62] Ibid., pp. 34, 35.63 [text00013.html#fn_63] Peter Levenda, The Hitler Legacy: The Nazi Cult inDiaspora: How it was Organized, How it was Funded, and Why it Remains a Threatto Global Security in the Age of Terrorism (Lake Worth, Florida: Ibis Press,2014), p. 127.

Thus, the Nazi regime would speak of the need to restore theWehrhoheit (“defense highness”) of Germany, i.e., to overturn the strictures ofVersailles, and undertake whatever defense and military measures it deemednecessary for the adequate self-defense of Germany.139 [text00013.html#fn_139] “legal unity,” Rechtseinheit, which in this contextcould also have been translated as “entity of law” or “legal entity.”140 [text00013.html#fn_140] Rath et al. op. cit., p. 134: “So ist es also auchfür das Großdeutsche reich die rechtseinheit night eine Tatsache, die sich ausder Schaffung dieses Reiches ohne weiterest ergibt, sondern eine Aufgabe.” The“realm” that is to be created is the future European Realm or Reich under Germanleadership, for note that Hallstein distinguishes this realm from thealready-existing Third Reich.141 [text00013.html#fn_141] Recall that the Madrid Circular explicitly statedthat the members of the “bomb plot” against Hitler were a ‘controlled andcontrived’ opposition, for the purpose of “sanctifying” their postwar positionas opponents of Hitler(and hence, of Hitler’s “marriage partner,” the Farbencartel).142 [text00013.html#fn_142] Rath et al., Die Nazi-Wurzeln der “Briisseler EU”,p. 80.143 [text00013.html#fn_143] Ibid., p. 88.144 [text00013.html#fn_144] Ibid., p. 119.145 [text00013.html#fn_145] The implications of this Nazi-cartel jurist’sshadowy presence in the background of CERN will be pondered more completely inchapter seven.

It should come as no surprise that the resemblance ofthese plans to the modern European Union, and the transitional phases leading toit, were exposed by two Britons, both of whom lived through the Thatcher era,and both of whom saw the famous “Iron Lady” British premier scuttled bypro-European union forces within her own Conservative Party. These two men wereas different as could be, one, the late Mr. Christopher Storey, was a typicalBritish middle class individual, alarmed at the erosions to standard libertiesthat had become a hard won feature of the British constitution and common lawthrough centuries of elaboration. The other, Bernard Connolly, was aprofessional “Eurocrat” who personally saw and dealt with the mechanisms of the“Eurocracy” on a day-to-day basis.

Some Parallels between the Funk-Farben-Reichsbank Study and ContemporaryEuropean Union Structures and PolicyIn his presentation of the above translation of the Funk-Farben-Reichsbank studyof European Economic Community issues, Storey makes frequent parentheticalcomments pointing out the parallels between these policy- and institutionalstructure-recommendations of the Nazis, and what has actually obtained in theEuropean Union. These parallels may be summarized and presented in the form of atable:001 [Image00029.jpg]For our purposes, the paper and proposals of Dr. Bernhard Benning are the focusof attention, for Benning addresses the specific issue of currency within theNazi schemes for a unified Europe.Recall, for a moment, what those proposals are, as indicated by the analyticaltable of contents’ summary in the Funk-Farben-Reichsbank book were:•The two aspects of currency•Domestic economic problems of European currencies•Foreign currency management and reciprocal billing•Extension of multilateral billing• The problem of clearing balances• Harmonization of European rates of exchange• The future form of the European Currency System• Europe’s future currency relations with the other key areas of the world•What about gold?• The European Currency BlocClearly, Benning and his sponsors have in mind a “European Currency bloc” thatis organized into a kind of “Reichsmark Zone” wherein the Reichsmark and theGerman economy which it represented functioned as a peg or benchmark for the“harmonization of European rates of exchange.” In other words, Benning, Funk,Farben, Nazi and Associates have in mind the manipulation of currency exchangerates, pegged to the Reichsmark, and this will require the “extension ofmultilateral billing” which would create “the problem of clearing balances,”requiring a new clearing system in Europe, requiring a new “Bank of EuropeanSettlements,” a kind of vastly expanded BIS functioning as the central bank forEurope.Indeed, the parallels between this new European Central Bank and the Bank ofInternational Settlements is all too palpable. Storey observes:The bank, to be based in Vienna, would be owned by individual governments andcentral banks, which would pay in share capital in proportion to their existingpre-war financial obligations. All payments between member countries would bemade through Europa Bank, which would also have the ability to grant Reichsmarkscredits to members to back export activity. The bank would have the power tolevy minimum reserves from central banks “to control expansion of credit bymember states.” This, of course, was an early blueprint of the collectivemonetary and currency arrangements which have been installed and operative since1998-1999, with spectacular consequences in that, from the first day followingits launch, the EU’s collective currency proceeded to depreciate and to remainprofoundly weak against the US dollar. 9 [text00014.html#fn9]The only significantly different feature between this “Europa Bank” and the Bankof International Settlements is that quite clearly, German dominance of theentity is written into the institution by dint of its ability to grant creditsin the German currency itself, at that time, the Reichsmark. 10[text00014.html#fn10] Indeed, if one looks closely at what is being proposed,what is being proposed is a tender of German currency for the nationalcurrencies of “the member states” in order to support the “large spaceeconomy’s” exports.Such plans so closely resemble the Exchange Rate Mechanism—the “glidepath tomonetary union” 11 [text00014.html#fn11] —that was established in the 1970s,that Storey himself draws attention to the point by pointing out that fellowBriton Bernard Connolly, who had worked closely in the European agencies and hadthe opportunity to view the Exchange Rate Mechanism at work closely, observedthat while individual countries could maintain their own currencies within theMechanism, they agreed to “permanently fixed exchange rates” against the Germancurrency, the Reichsmark 12 [text00014.html#fn12] under theFunk-Farben-Reichsbank plan, and the Deutschmark under the agreement thatactually emerged, the Exchange Rate Mechanism in the 1970s. Connolly had this tosay about the parallels between the Nazi plans of the Funk-Faben-Reichsbank bookand what actually emerged:Most interesting of all, for our purposes, was the paper on the future ‘EuropeanCurrency System’. The paper, an extension of a July 1940 analysis by the ReichsEconomics Ministry, was given by Dr Bernhard Benning, Director of theReichs-Kredit-Gesellschaft. The key features of the Reich EconomicsMinistry/Benning blueprint were that the Reichsmark would be the leadingcurrency in a German ‘economic area’ and, with the dollar, one of the world’stwo reserve currencies. ‘Within the German currency bloc’, fixed exchange rateswould be introduced to ‘ease the way later to a currency and customs union’.There would be a Bank of Europe, but ‘For political reasons it could beundesirable to damage the self-esteem of member states by eliminating theircurrencies’. Thus, initially at least, individual countries would maintain theirown currencies, but would agree to permanently fixed exchange rates against theReichsmark. In other words, there would be a Reichsmarkzone in the German‘Grosswirtschaftsraum’. The members of this R-mark zone would be Germany itself(including, of course, Austria and Bohemia and Moravia), the Netherlands,Belgium (and thus presumable Luxembourg, which had been in monetary union withBelgium since 1926), Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria andHungary. Italy and Japan, the other two Axis powers, would also each lead a‘Grosswirtschaftsarum’ (including Spain, Greece and Turkey in the Italian case).Russia (in accordance with the Ribbentop-Molotov pact) would dominate theeconomic affairs of Finland and the Baltic states. Britain would have anundefined ‘Grosswirtschaftsraum’ (presumably involving its colonies) and the USAwould dominate the whole of the Americas. The ‘missing’ country, interestingly,was France, which was neither included in the German currency area nor accordeda ‘Grosswirtschaftsraum’ of its own. 13 [text00014.html#fn13]However, before we can examine the Exchange Rate Mechanism and its actual realfunctioning as a “glidepath to monetary union” and the creation of a commoncurrency, the euro, itself, we must first appreciate what both the wartime plan,and the actual Exchange Rate Mechanism really are, for they constitute nothingless than a tender in a certain sense of the German currency for the nationalcurrencies of Europe, which currencies are pegged to the German and hence to theGerman economy and financial and political leadership.As one can imagine, there was one country on the continent that was not about tobe dominated financially, economically, or politically, and that saw theExchange Rate Mechanism as a means of asserting its dominance over thecontinent. Thus, the history of the Exchange Rate Mechanism becomes a microcosmfor a very old struggle, and we must now examine it closely, for that countrywas precisely the one excluded in the Benning paper:…France.B. The Currency Cartel: The Tower of Basel Moment of History1. Can’t You Two Just Get Along?Initially, the Exchange Rate Mechanism came about as a currency-exchange ratepeg of smaller European nations’ currencies to the Deutschmark, since theireconomies were closely tied to their large neighbor. This was the case for theNetherlands and its guilder, for Luxembourg and Belgium and Denmark and theirfrancs and kroner. The idea, in this form, was perhaps sound as far as it went,for these currencies were supposed to fluctuate only within certain bands ormargins above or below the D-mark, and this fluctuation was reflective of theireconomies being so closely tied to Germany’s:The key element in this doomsday machine was the key element of the (ExchangeRate Mechanism) itself: the markets’ absolute conviction that the (Deutschmark)would never be formally devalued within the system. It was from this convictionthat everything flowed: the DM’s role as anchor of the system, the impossibilityfor nominal rates on other currencies in the system to be substantially lowerthan the German rates and, ultimately, the inability of the system to survivespeculative attack… 14 [text00014.html#fn14]When those pre-determined bottoms or ceilings in exchange rates began to beapproached, it was understood that the German Bundesbank would step in and takethe appropriate action to maintain the margins of the exchange rate peg, eitherby buying or selling those currencies, adjusting its prime rate, and so on.It was when the rest of Western Europe’s large economies, Spain, Italy, and mostespecially, France, were integrated into the Exchange Rate Mechanism that thingsbegan to change, and the Mechanism became a geopolitical tool, or, as Connollyobserved, a mechanism of monetary warfare disguised as cooperation 15[text00014.html#fn15] and diplomacy. 16 [text00014.html#fn16] That disguisedmonetary warfare came in the form of a protracted struggle between Europe’s twolargest powers for domination of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, and hence, ofwhatever “common currency” came out of it.Indeed, as Connolly observed, the Exchange Rate Mechanism is not only the key tounderstanding the current European Union and “Eurozone,” it was largely thecreation of Germany and France. 17 [text00014.html#fn17] As such, its historywas largely the history of three major battles between France and Germany, orrather, between France and the Bundesbank, 18 [text00014.html#fn18] or to put itsomewhat differently, the Exchange Rate Mechanism was simply a revival of thetraditional Franco-German struggle for the domination of the continent usingeconomic, rather than military, means: “It is the battle for control of theEuropean superstate, in which French technocrats confront German federalists,both sides claiming to fight under the banner of Charlemagne.” 19[text00014.html#fn19] Indeed, shortly after the inauguration of the Mechanism,then French President d’Estang and German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt repeatedlyemphasized the symbolism, and “the two leaders paid a special visit to thethrone of Charlemagne and a special service was held in the Cathedral” whiled’Estang remaked that “the spirit of Charlemagne brooded over us.” 20[text00014.html#fn20]The invocation by both sides of the symbolism of Charlemagne, of Karl derGrosse, is not accidental, for France and Germany, as the dominant Europeanpowers, intend the European superstate to be the reanimation of the empire ofCharlemagne, which encompassed both modern counties. It is a “Franco-Germanaxis,” 21 [text00014.html#fn21] and the fact that the meetings of the EuropeanCommunity’s council of ministers occurred in “the Charlemagne building inBrussels” was thus “no coincidence.” 22 [text00014.html#fn22]There is one final factor that must be reckoned with before the Franco-Germanconflict within the Exchange Rate Mechanism can be fully appreciated. Connollypoints out that the Bundesbank was created after World War Two with a fargreater measure of independence from the West German government than the centralbanks of other European powers, particularly France. This was, in part, due tothe pre-war and wartime experience of the close coordination of the Reichsbankand the Nazi government, a coordination which the Allies wanted to prevent fromre-occurring. Thus, the battle lines were drawn between the governments ofFrance and Germany on the one hand, which saw the Exchange Rate Mechanism as the“glidepath” to the euro, and the Bundesbank on the other, which would berequired to support the currencies of other nations—including France—when thepre-established margin pegs for currency fluctuations were approached. However,once the Bundesbank’s role is appreciated in this context, the deepergeopolitical contest between the two countries always remained.The reasons for the inevitability of Franco-German conflict with the Mechanismwere clear, for once it was extended to encompass France, the inevitablequestion of “who leads” became apparent, a question that—within the limitedmechanism of Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Belgium, a limited networkknown by the nickname of “the Snake”—never had to be broached because the answerwas crystal clear. But what did the expanded Mechanism represent?Did it represent a major change in the German-dominated snake (as claimed inFrance), or an extension of the domain of the snake to France and Italy (asclaimed in Germany)? In the new empire of Charlemagne, who would playCharlemagne? 23 [text00014.html#fn23]The reason for the contest becomes even clearer when one recalls that to gainentry into the Exchange Rate mechanism, countries had to prove that theireconomies, and domestic policies, would be able to operate within itsconstraints. 24 [text00014.html#fn24]This point cannot be pondered long enough, for this very fact means that whatthe Mechanism really is, is a currency cartel, i.e., the deliberate manipulationof market prices—in this case the price of a particular currency within theMechanism—by the wider cartel and by its “anchor company and currency,” in thiscase, the Bundesbank and D-mark. Entry into this cartel depended upon theeconomic condition of the country (just as entry into the Farben cartel wasdetermined by the economic and fiscal health of its component companies), and bya demonstrated willingness of that country to conform to the operationalpolicies of the wider cartel. 25 [text00014.html#fn25] That is to say, countrieshad demonstrate their willingness to suborn their domestic economic andfinancial policies to that of the cartel. As will be seen, France, in particularattempted to become, along with Germany, the “hard core” or “co-anchor” withinthis cartel system, as indeed, did the other larger economies. Once theMechanism was expanded to the rest of Europe as the “glidepath” to currencyunion, its history, from then on, was one of “the frantic efforts of non-Germanwould-be members of the ‘hard core’ to prove their virtue by undergoing a trialby ordeal—while within Germany the battle raged for the right to determine whowould be judge in that trial,” 26 [text00014.html#fn26] for after all, it wasthe Bundesbank, and ultimately, the German citizen, who was committed to supportthe other, weaker, economies and currencies in the system. 27[text00014.html#fn27]To put it country simple, the Bundesbank’s opposition to all the schemes of thepoliticians boiled down to its hostility to having French politicians have anymeasure of influence over German economic and currency policy. 28[text00014.html#fn28]2. The Geopolitics of the Exchange Rate Mechanism: the European EconomicCommunity, the USA, and The Return of the Madrid CircularHowever, why would French President d’Estang and German Chancellor Schmidtundertake secret negotiations to establish such an unwieldy currency cartel inthe first place? As is to be expected, the chief reasons were both cultural andgeopolitical. For some French elites, the concept of “Europe” was being promotedbecause they viewed it “almost as synonymous with Christendom, a counter to thesupposedly pagan Anglo-Saxon worship of markets and a bulwark against decadentAnglo-Saxon culture.” 29 [text00014.html#fn29] In other words, “Europe” was tobe a counterbalance to the financial and geopolitical weight of the USA and itsprincipal financial and geopolitical ally, Great Britain. For the French eliteof both the political right and left, “Europe”—which in this context essentiallymeans some sort of political and monetary-economic union with Germany in areanimation of Charlemagne’s empire—was principally a way “of increasing musclein a series of struggles, primarily against the United States, over culture,economic philosophy, ‘spheres of influence’ and economic hegemony.” 30[text00014.html#fn30] Such thinking was, as we have seen, consistently presentin German thinking—again both of the political right and left—since the FirstWorld War and throughout the entire Nazi era, and was reflected in the almostineluctable logic of the Madrid Circular. It is not accidental, therefore, tofind a French president of the political right in the form of d’Estangnegotiating secretly with a German chancellor of the political left in the formof Schmidt for the creation of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. One might argue thatin the wake of 9/11 and an almost out-of-control American “unipolarism” that thepressures on France and Germany to maintain such a power bloc, and to maneuvergradually for ever greater freedom from American economic and militarydomination, has only added fuel to the fire of such concepts.Behind the thinking of the French Eurocrats, however, there were even largercompelling cultural and geopolitical issues, and these factors again playeddeeply into the consistent German planning for a European “Reich.” The dogma ofthe obsolescence of the nation-state runs like a golden thread throughout theconceptions not only of the German elites, 31 [text00014.html#fn31] as has beenseen, but also of their French counterparts, for “The most careful historicalresearch into the development of the (European Community) shows that theCommunity has, up to now, been a mechanism for preserving those features ofregulatory state power that liberals find objectionable. It is this feature ofEurope that has made it attractive to Socialists and corporatists in nationalgovernments and the Commission.” 32 [text00014.html#fn32] For the FrenchEurocrats, this meant that the European union represented a move away from thenation-state—a state founded upon common linguistic and cultural values—to thestate-nation, “depicted as the creation of feelings of unity among manydifferent ‘tribes’ through common fealty to a state whose principles andfunctions offer material, social and even spiritual advantages to all those whochoose to accept them.” 33 [text00014.html#fn33] To put the question in yet adifferent form, was there to be a European Germany or a German Europe? 34[text00014.html#fn34] Who, to put Connolly’s apt framing of the question again,was to play Charlemagne?3. The Election of Francois Mitterand and German Reunificationa. The Election Victory of Francois Mitterrand in 1981(1) The Monetary TangoThe question of “who is to play Charlemagne?” was to come to a head by twoevents that would shape the future structure of the European Union into theinstitutionalized “stalemate anchored on Germany” rather than France that it istoday. Those events were the election of the Socialist government of FrancoisMitterrand in France in 1981, and the German reunification under Helmut Kohl alittle over a decade later. After Mitterrand’s election, thegeopolitical-monetary tango began, as both countries agreed to the incorporationof other countries—including France—into the “snake.” France was hoping tooffset the already preponderant weight of Germany within this system, a weightamplified by the participation of the Netherlands in the snake, and thuscoupling the Dutch guilder to the German D-mark, by establishing a similarinternal mechanism with Belgium and Luxembourg in the French orbit. 35[text00014.html#fn35]The result of the machinations of President Mitterrand and his ministers,however, was “that France would first have to suffer the humiliation of amonetary Vichy.” 36 [text00014.html#fn36] Bear that reference to wartime “VichyFrance” in mind, for it will bear potential fruit in a moment. Indeed, Francehad suffered a kind of “Monetary Sedan,” a replay of the decisive battle of theFranco-Prussian war, that left Emperor Napoleon III surrounded by Prussianarmies, and that eventually made him a prisoner-of-war of Chancellor Bismarck.It was the first monetary victory for the Germans against France within theExchange Rate Mechanism:Germany was now in a position vis-à-vis France even stronger than it had beenvis-à-vis the small countries in the old ‘snake’. It was deciding the ‘when’ andthe ‘how much’ of franc devaluations. In addition, it was dictating the domesticpolicies the French government must follow. From the French side, things seemedvery clear indeed. The combination of the ERM and the out-and-out Socialistphase of Mitterrand’s government had led to almost total French monetarysubjugation to Germany. But even worse was to come. 37 [text00014.html#fn37]By March of 1983, the subjugation was so complete that the Germans had theirsecond victory in yet another devaluation of the franc, one that Connollycharacterized as “a sort of monetary 1940,” 38 [text00014.html#fn38] recallingthe blitz of German panzers through the Ardennes, the breakthrough at Sedan(once again), and the dash to the Channel, isolating the bulk of France’s forcesin a pocket and cutting off their supplies, a defeat that made the fall ofFrance inevitable.(2) The Strangely Unnoticed Behavior of Mitterrand’s Government, and the UglyUnanswered Question Squatting in the Middle of ItOf course, the French were not about to simply “sit and take it” withoutoffering some resistance, and the Mitterrand government hit upon a “solution” sobizarre and unusual that its very outline raises a nasty question aboutMitterrand’s motivations and ultimate masters. Here it is necessary to citeConnolly, for the suggestions and implications of his remarks are obvious:The devaluation of March 1983 marked the acceptance by Mitterrand…that, in themodern world economic order, ‘Socialism in One Country’ was economicallyimpossible. Instead, they set their sights on the creation of ‘Corporatism inOne Continent’, along lines similar, as it happens, to those envisaged by Naziand Vichy theorists, to confront the ‘Anglo-Saxon’ world. 39[text00014.html#fn39]What was this “Corporatism on One Continent”? French theorists called it“Rhenisch capitalism,” 40 [text00014.html#fn40] the “capitalism of the Rhine,”or in other words, the capitalism of the large German-anchored multinationalcartels, a capitalism of “the big battalions, the industrial-financial complex,the banking cartels, the big business associations, the trade unions.” 41[text00014.html#fn41]Beginning in 1994 in France, a series of books and articles began to appearquestioning Mitterrand’s past, and particularly, his role in the Nazi puppetregime of Marshal Petain in Vichy France. The question soon became controversialand articles even appeared in the American press, recounting Mitterrand’sdubious association with the Vichy regime, while simultaneously aiding andabetting the French resistance. 42 [text00014.html#fn42] Given thiscollaborationist-Petainist past, the possibility arises that Mitterrand may havebeen deliberately emplaced to emasculate France monetarily at the crucialmoment. This does not, however, mean that Mitterrand was either a Nazi, or atraitor, at least, not in the conventional sense of the word, for like allFrenchmen during the difficult years of the German occupation, he had to decideon how much collaboration, and how much resistance, was best to offer for thelong-term good of France. This said, perhaps one must look elsewhere forMitterrand’s ultimate masters and motivations, and these are suggested by hiswillingness to revive the corporatist-cartelist ideas that were current in VichyFrance as it was being integrated into the then emerging Nazi-sponsored“European economic zone” dominated by the Reichsmark. Viewed in thatperspective, one cannot discount the possibility that his election andmonetarily disastrous policies for French monetary sovereignty may not have beenaccidental, but perhaps the result of deliberate long-term planning.b. The German Wiedervereinigung and the Implications of Kohl’s Tender Offer forthe Exchange Rate MechanismThe other major event in the final German victory in the Exchange Rate Mechanismwars, and the victory that led directly to the final unraveling—perhapsintentional—of that Mechanism and to the creation of the euro and Eurozoneitself, was German reunification under Christian Democratic Chancellor HelmutKohl. The Fall of the Berlin Wall was a shock to the whole geopolitical andeconomic balance of the continent, and more importantly, a shock to the idea ofthe “Europe” of the Eurocrats, 43 [text00014.html#fn43] for a reunited Germanywould possess even more financial and geopolitical weight within any currency orpolitical federation than merely West Germany did before.The principal problem confronting West German politicians and policy makers waswhat would happen in the eventuality that the Communist bloc crumbled. EastGermany’s mark was worth about one tenth of the West German, and itsstate-sponsored industries were simply not competitive. Consequently, when theBerlin Wall did fall and the borders between East and West Germany were nolonger militarized, West Germany was faced with a potential flood of peopleleaving the eastern zone—possibly permanently—and thus placing a huge strain onthe German economy. The problem was how to prevent that from happening. 44[text00014.html#fn44]Kohl, however, had a plan suspiciously ready-to-hand, and that was simply a“Tender Plan,” which basically amounted to a swap of D-marks for East Germanmarks, not at their market convertibility rate, but at par value, that is tosay, one West German mark was exchanged for one East German mark. 45[text00014.html#fn45] The result was predictable:East German families, suddenly finding their wages (or welfare payments) worthseven times as much in terms of West German goods and services as theypreviously had been, would be likely to go on a spending spree—in West Germany.All in all, there was likely to be a further surge in the demand for goods andservices in the new German monetary union as a whole, yet the output of theunion as a whole would fall as East German firms became even more uncompetitivethan before on world markets (and as previously guaranteed markets in EasternEurope and the Soviet Union collapsed). 46 [text00014.html#fn46]Kohl’s scheme, however, worked, for it kept the East German population for themost part in place, boosted the West German economy, and in the long run—orrather as it turned out—very short run, paved the way for the Anschluss of thetwo Germanies as West Germany simply swallowed the entire former eastern zonewhole. 47 [text00014.html#fn47]The problem, however, remained France, and how to assuage “French fears ofGerman domination of the Continent.” 48 [text00014.html#fn48] This was done bygiving the French assurances not only that Germany would give a solemn pledgenot only to join a monetary union, but that in the meantime that Germany wouldnot attempt any realignment of the D-mark versus the franc peg rates within theExchange Rate Mechanism. 49 [text00014.html#fn49] In other words, in spite ofthe fact that the German economy was now vastly expanded, and in spite of thefact that the D-mark had suffered a de facto temporary devaluation, the Kohlgovernment committed itself to maintaining rate pegs reflective of thepre-reunification rather than the post-reunification economic realities.For the moment, Kohl had appeased Mitterrand (or, if one takes the view thatMitterrand and Kohl were both acting in the interests of the German-anchoredcartels, both men had fought off, for the moment, the appearance of a completelyGerman dominated currency zone within the Exchange Rate Mechanism).c. The Beginning of the End for the Exchange Rate Mechanism:(1) Alphandéry’s GaffeThis state of affairs was not to last, however, for it all came very near tounraveling—and a persuasive case could be made that it did come unraveled, atleast from the French point of view—in the gaffes made by French EconomicsMinister Edmond Alphandéry. In the period of the late 1980s, as it was becomingincreasingly clear to careful observers that the Soviet-Warsaw Pact bloc wasgoing to implode economically and politically, and that German reunification waslooking more and more likely, Alphandéry spoke on June 24, 1993 on French radio,and “In just a few seconds, sealed the fate” of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. 50[text00014.html#fn50] In the talk, Minister Alphandéry implied that he wassummoning the president of the Bundesbank, Helmut Schlesinger, “to Paris thenext day to tell them that German interest rates had an importance going farbeyond Germany’s borders. There were millions of unemployed in France, and thehope of reducing unemployment depended on cuts in German interest rates.” 51[text00014.html#fn51]The effect of Alphandéry’s talk in the financial markets was electric,particularly in Europe. 52 [text00014.html#fn52] Alphandéry’s gaffe was almosttotal, particularly when viewed from the German side of the Rhine:What had Alphandéry done that caused mouths to gape with horrified surprise? Inshort, he was The Man who Told the Truth about the (Exchange Rate Mechanism).What Alphandéry did was, by mistake, to state the bleeding obvious, reposed on adetermination to avoid stating the bleeding obvious. More specifically,Alphandéry demolished at a stroke the arguments defended by Trichet. He admittedthat French unemployment was linked to the level of short-term interest rates—aproposition that Trichet and his minions ridiculed as a symptomatic effusion of‘Anglo-Saxon economics’. He then signaled to the markets that Germany was stillthe boss in the system: there was no more room to reduce French short-terminterest rates unless the Bundesbank cut its rates first. Next, and perhaps mostdamaging of all, he gave the impression of issuing summonses and orders to theBundesbank—an institution whose public image forbade it from appearing, whateverthe reality might be, to take orders from the German government, never mind theFrench. 53 [text00014.html#fn53]Or, to put it in terms of the military analogies of Franco-German wars,Alphandéry had managed to combine the French defeats at Sedan in theFranco-Prussian War and World War Two into one colossal financial-politicaldebacle.Naturally, the public reaction from Helmut Schlesinger and the Bundesbank wasone of outrage and anger. But privately, the reaction was one of elation, for…the weakness of the French economic position had been revealed to theinternational markets; the offensiveness of the French political position hadbeen fully revealed to the German public. Schlesinger’s position wasstrengthened immeasurably. He could now be sure of the support of public opinionin any battle of wills with Kohl about supporting the franc. And, without theslightest possible doubt, there would now be further attacks on the franc. 54[text00014.html#fn54]The weakness of the French political position was now evident, and thedesperation of French Eurocrats to “preserve the faith” and use the Mechanism asa glidepath to European currency unification could not occur without Germany,for as has been made abundantly clear by now, the Bundesbank and the D-mark werethe anchor and peg of the whole system, and were thus responsible for shoring upweaker currencies to maintain them within the pre-established margins ofexchange within the mechanism.This led to a remarkable exchange between Jean-Claude Trichet and Bundesbankvice president Hans Tietmeyer a few days later, at an international meeting tocoordinate the business of the continent’s heavily subsidized airliners:Trichet arrived in the meeting-rom before Tietmeyer. By the time the Germanentered, the room was almost full. The other participants were treated to anexperience that was revealing of the post-gaffe state of Franco-German monetaryrelations almost to the point of embarrassment. As soon as Trichet sawTietmeyer, he rushed towards him gasping ‘Cher Hans’ and, evidently wanting togive physical expression to the celebrated phrase, ‘two hearts beating as one,flung his arms around him. Tietmeyer’s whole stolid, Westphalian body wentrigid, his arms ramrod-straight by his sides. Trichet gazed up, apparentlyentranced, into Tietmeyer’s unwontedly discomposed face, maintaining his embraceso long and so close that onlookers began counting the seconds. Neither party tothe embrace, neither the willing nor the unwilling, spoke a word, nor did anyoneelse in the room. Tension mounted: would Trichet release his grip on Tietmeyer?Would Tietmeyer extricate himself forcibly? Then the door opened; a latecomerentered the room. He stopped dead in his tracks as his eyes fell on the strangetableau before him, giving the relieved spectators the chance to laugh. Thetension dissipated, Trichet and Tietmeyer grinned embarrassedly, and theFrenchman’s arms fell away from his liege-lord. No one who witness this scenecould have any doubt about its meaning. The principle of Divine Right wasre-established. The monetary courtier Trichet was seeking public forgiveness ofhis sovereign for an act of attempted rebellion by France. 55[text00014.html#fn55]After much theater—including joint Franco-German statements that thefranc-D-mark peg would remain unchanged, Schlesinger’s Bundesbank by Friday,July 30, 1993 was in a difficult position, for the franc-D mark peg—and theFrench position within the Mechanism and its aspirations within “Greater Europe”were hanging by a thread.It all depended on what Schlesinger’s Bundesbank would do. And the speculationsabounded as the currency markets closed for the weekend:Rumours flew everywhere: that Kohl had threatened to change the Bundesbank Lawis the bank did not save the (Exchange Rate Mechanism); that Schlesinger hadthreatened to resign if Kohl continued to press him; that Alphandéry, Juppé,Balladur and Mitterrand were all ceaselessly cajoling Kohl; that Tietmeyerplanned to lead a rebellion within the Bundesbank Council. One report that doesappear to have been firmly based on fact is that the Bundesbank had been phoningaround the largest market players, asking them how big a reduction it would needto make in its discount rate in order to keep the (Exchange Rate Mechanism)intact—bigger and bigger as the weekend progressed. On Friday afternoon, marketcomment called for a half-point cut in the discount rate. Saturday’s newspaperspoke of 0.75% as the cost of holding the (Exchange Rate Mechanism) together. BySunday, it appeared that only a full point would suffice. To anyone with anyinsight into Bundesbank thinking, these reports were the final evidence that the(Exchange Rate Mechanism) was going to collapse. Had not Schlesinger made itclear in April that whatever else happened, the Bundesbank would not let themarket determine German monetary policy? Yet by the end of the weekend, mostcommentators had convinced themselves that the Bundesbank would cave in topolitical pressure from Kohl and cut its discount rate by a full point. 56[text00014.html#fn56]As will be seen momentarily, however, there is some reason to believe that thetensions between Kohl and the German central bank might have been a bit oftheater for public consumption.But on Monday, as currency traders in New York anxiously awaited the expectedannouncement of the cut in German discount rates from the Bundesbank so thatthey could begin selling D-Marks and buying dollars, the announcement came fromFrankfurt that there would be no cut, “no full point cut, no three-quarter pointcut, no half point: nothing.” 57 [text00014.html#fn57] What ensued was not theexpected sell-off of the D-Mark, but rather, of every other currency nowenmeshed in the Mechanism: pesetas, escudos, Belgian francs, Danish kroner, andespecially, French francs, forcing the Banque de France to intervene massivelyto attempt to keep the franc within the margins of the Mechanism’s peg to theD-Mark. 58 [text00014.html#fn58]France now played its one remaining card, and demanded that the Bundesbank bailout and defend the French franc, according to the Mechanism’s rules. The onlyother way to fix the problem would be for an immediate monetary union—a commoncurrency—for both Germany and France, which would “freeze” out the other majorEuropean economies, Spain and Italy. 59 [text00014.html#fn59] The Germans,including Tietmeyer, immediately and correctly perceived the French demands asnot only the abandonment of Germany’s monetary sovereignty, but as arelinquishment of the role of “playing Charlemagne” to the French.This was too much, even for Chancellor Kohl, and the Bundesbank andBundeskanzlei closed ranks. The Mechanism was no more, and the Eurozone, thepapering-over (pun intended!) of the Franco-German disputes, came into itsexistence, with the German economy still in the curious position of being bothlocomotive and caboose to the rest of Europe, both driving, and yet having tobail out, the financial shenanigans of its smaller and less competitiveneighbors.It is, however, a curious fact that the European Central Bank located, not inBrussels, nor in Paris, but in Frankfurt, headquarters of the old Farben cartel.This curious fact, in spite of the public presentation of the Eurozone as theresult of the “stalemate” of the currency wars between France and Germany underthe Exchange Rate Mechanism, suggests that perhaps the presentation of stalemateis merely meant to assuage certain parties’ wounded national pride, and suggestsalso that there are other factors perhaps lurking in the background of anentirely non-financial, non-economic nature.After all, neither the Bundesbank nor the Kohl government caved into to thepressures from Paris.(2) Kohl and the Bundesbank Present a United Front: The Kohl-Lammers CDU PaperWhat that “something else” might have been is strongly suggested by observationsthat Connolly himself makes in his book, for he makes the trenchant and profoundobservation that “Europe” may mean one thing to the French bureaucrats, andquite another to the German elite. “Kohl,” observed Connolly, was hardly thetype of man that believed that “Germany needs to be ‘saved from itself” and that“Europe” may have been for the “Chancellor of the Reunification”—the Chancellorwho clearly had prepared carefully for the reunification not only with his“Tender Scheme” but also by apparently activating dormant cells within EastGermany to help drive the process from the other side 60 [text00014.html#fn60]—but a means “to legitimize a ‘German Europe’ including not only Frankenreichbut also the lands to the east of Germany.” 61 [text00014.html#fn61] Indeed, asI recounted in The Nazi International, the Kohl government moved veryquickly—and forcefully—after the reunification to break apart theVersailles-created “countries” of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, and to reassertclose German economic dominance over Bohemia-Moravia and the newly recognizedCroation breakaway state in the former Yugoslavia. As I put in in that book, theplaybook seems exactly that of 1938-1939, and 1941: “Is it live, or is itMemorex?” 62 [text00014.html#fn62]Clearly, something was giving the Kohl government the confidence to undertakesuch bold moves, and such outright defiance of the “old enemy,” France.The question is, what was it?A clue is perhaps afforded by a paper that was “produced in September 1994” byChancellor Kohl’s political party, the Christian Democratic Union, and its…Parliamentary Committee on European Affairs under its chairman, Karl Lammers.This document, apparently approved by Kohl, insisted that France must abandonits ‘obsession’ with the ‘empty shell of the nation-state’ and that monetary andpolitical union must proceed via a ‘hard core’ of Germany, France, the Beneluxand Denmark. It also contained a naked threat: ‘Never again must there be adestabilizing vacuum of power in central Europe. If European integration werenot to progress, Germany might be called upon, or tempted by its own securityconstraints, to try to effect the stabilization (a word full of unpleasanthistorical echoes) on its own, and in the traditional way.’ Naturally, the‘peripheral’ countries reacted unfavourably to the report(as, it needs to besaid, did the [Social Democratic Party] and [Free Democratic Party] in Germany).63 [text00014.html#fn63]To put it succinctly, was the old blackmail diplomacy in a new guise: unite withus in a German-led European Union, or we might have to go our own way again. Forpost-reunification Germany, the idea of “Europe” was simply a flanking maneuveraround its own past.And notably, the Kohl-Lammers document from the Christian Democratic Party’sParliamentary Committee on European Affairs was couching such European Union inthe now familiar old terms of Mitteleuropa and the need for a strong Germandominance to replace the vacuum created by the dissolution of Austria-Hungary.The document simply and essentially repeats what has already been encountered inthe Madrid Circular, and that formed the crucial conceptions of the wartime Nazistudies.C. A Secret Kohl-Gorbachev Treaty?But again, the question recurs: what could have given Kohl’s government suchconfidence? Such confidence could only have come from political strength, andhere Connolly briefly suggests what it was:Intriguingly, there may also have been a dramatic geopolitical element in theBundesbank’s attitude. According to some analysts, Kohl and Gorbachev hadalready come to an agreement, in the autumn of 1987, on German reunification inreturn for Western acceptance, to be brokered by Germany, that the BalticStates, the Ukraine and Byelorussia would remain within the Soviet sphere ofinfluence. 64 [text00014.html#fn64]The agreement, moreover, could not be made public until circumstances to theAmerican disengagement from Europe. 65 [text00014.html#fn65]Accepting for the sake of argument that there was such a Molotov-Ribbentrop Pactversion 2.0, a “Kohl-Gorbachev Update,” then recent geopolitical events inEurope begin to take on new meaning, for there is possibly a hidden factor inthe background driving events that otherwise would seem on the surface to beinsane, including the sudden American actions intervening in the Ukraine,toppling a government that indicated it was reneging on moves to join theEuropean Union, and closing bases in Western Europe, moving them and stationingtroops into Poland, the Baltic States, Romania, and the Ukraine, for these moveswould be entirely understandable if the USA were attempting to prevent aresurgence of a German-dominated and led European Union, and any rapprochementbetween German-led Europe and Russia. In other words, recent American actions inEastern Europe make sense only if viewed as counter-actions against long-timeGerman plans for a united Europe.It is thus crucial to understand what has actually been asserted here, forConnolly, let is also be recalled, worked in the highest levels of the Europeanbureaucracy, and thus any mention of such a secret treaty by him should be takenwith all the gravity and weight it deserves. In his reading, Kohl could thusafford to be “magnanimous” with the French by acceding to a monetary union, 66[text00014.html#fn66] provided of course, that in return for these “concessions”the European Central Bank would be based in Germany.One who took Connolly’s indications seriously was fellow Briton ChristopherStorey, whom we encountered earlier, for Storey goes so far as to state thatafter German pressure successfully cracked up Czechoslovakia into its moreeasily digestible components of Bohemia-Moravia and Slovakia, 67[text00014.html#fn67] the Czechs in vain attempted to draw attention to thissecret treaty by leaking some of its details in the Prague media. 68[text00014.html#fn68] Additionally, hints of this secret agreement also appearedin the Russian press, for a Russian foreign policy specialist, Igor Maksimychevstated in the Russian Foreign Ministry’s journal International Affairs that“Today we have the opportunity to influence…universal European security directlythrough our bilateral relations with Germany which are of a special nature.” 69[text00014.html#fn69]Nor was this all, for Maksimychev, whom Storey qualifies as a “senior Leninistapparatchik” also expressed some anxiety in his article, making itclear that Moscow thinks that Germany’s model was making faster progress thanits own, that Germany cannot be trusted to further Moscow’s ‘universal Europeanintegration’ strategy, and that Moscow must make sure that the Pan-Germanstrategy is reliably channeled, by whatever means, so that it promotes theSoviet Leninists’ objectives at the expense of the Pan-German model. 70[text00014.html#fn70]Thus, as Storey notes, the Russian objectives to create a greater EurasianEconomic Union, or a “Europe from the Atlantic to Vladivostok”—itself aconsistent goal of Russian foreign policy since the late Tsars, and a matter ofdetailed planning under Lenin—is at loggerheads with Germany’s plans for aGerman-led “Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals,” a proposition which suggeststhat the ultimate German aim is to detach European Russia from the rest of thecountry, a goal which is consistent with British and American objectives (forthe British, likewise since the nineteenth century), and which could alsoconceivably be done without American help, by invoking the assistance of Asia’sother two powerhouses: China, and Japan.Behind all the rhetoric of “customs unions” and “free trade,” it is in essencethe same old Great Power geopolitical game. The only thing that has changed, isnot that the old familiar players—France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany,and Russia—have gone away, but rather, that new players have been added to thelist: the USA and Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and China,India, and Brazil in the late 20th century. 71 [text00014.html#fn71]1. Its Alleged ProtocolsHowever, Storey goes much further, for the Czech newspaper Tydenik Politikasummarized the entire alleged German-Soviet secret pact in its paper for theweek of November 14-20, 1991, fully one year, as Storey notes, prior to thecrack-up of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia under German pressure, a fact thatwould seem to confirm the probability of the reality of the pact. 72[text00014.html#fn72]The details of the pact as reproduced by Tydenik Politika, and translated byStorey, make for chilling reading:•The German Federal Republic demands (sic) from the USSR compensation forannexed eastern Prussia and for the area east of the Oder-Neisse (line). 73[text00014.html#fn73]•The German Federal Republic demands withdrawal of Soviet influence in theBohemian-Moravian region. The Soviet Union is unwilling to tolerate in thevicinity of their borders a Czechoslovak Federal republic régime which does notaccept the Soviet gesture that allowed Husak’s régime to fall in Czechoslovakia.The Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist federal republic is unceasing inits agitation against the USSR and is making the position of the SovietGovernment and the President more and more difficult. This is a position that isdifferent from that of the Polish and Hungarian Governments.•The USSR will (therefore) not object to the splitting of the CzechoslovakSocialist Federal Republic, due to an insufficient guarantee of politicalequilibrium in Central Europe and the lack of statesmanship of both the Czechand Slovak nations.•The USSR supports the potential membership of the Bohemian and Moravian regionswithin the sphere of economic interests of the German Federal Republic and thepolitical incorporation of these regions into Germany within 12 to 15 years (ofSeptember-October 1990).•The Federal Republic of Germany will compensate the USSR for the economiclosses thus inflicted on the Soviet Union. 74 [text00014.html#fn74] The FederalGerman Republic will prepare for a possible decline in popularity of the presentCzechoslovak Socialist Federal republic leadership by preparing groups, having apositive attitude towards Germany and which are acceptable even to the SovietUnion, drawn as an alternative even from left wing parties (sic), withoutevident interference in the process of proliferation of political parties. 75[text00014.html#fn75]•With regard to the willingness of Hungary to maintain political and economicstability in the Danube region, the USSR and the Federal Republic of Germanywill not object to the re-establishment of a Hungary within the originalborders, as stipulated by the Trianon Treaty. The Federal Republic of Germanywill increase its economic aid to Hungary in order to lift the standard ofliving in Hungary above that (prevailing) in Slovakia, so that joining Hungarybecomes attractive to Slovakia. 76 [text00014.html#fn76]•The USSR has no objections to the establishment of a German university and highschools in the regions of Bohemia and Moravia, and to the financing of theseschools by Germany.•The USSR does not object to the breaking-up of Yugoslavia, and supports thetransfer of Croatia and Slovenia into the economic sphere of Germany.•The USSR has no objections to the deployment of (the means of procuring)political destablisation 77 [text00014.html#fn77]•The Federal Republic of Germany will not become engaged in issues concerning(the) Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and will not consider them to bean area of economic interest, above and beyond an acceptable level.• The USSR will not object to the separation of Ciscarpathian Ukraine in theevent of establishing activity undertaken by Ukrainian nationalists, and itsincorporation into a Hungarian Republic.•The USSR does not object to the gradual colonization of the Czech border areasby Soviets and Germans. 78 [text00014.html#fn78]Note the hugely significant fact that note only did this alleged pact (whichreads more like a memorandum of understanding) predict the crack-up ofYugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, but that Storey, who passed away prior to thecurrent problems in the Ukraine being caused by “nationalists,” 79[text00014.html#fn79] could not have known of this event. Thus, one must add tothe corroboration of the pact a third component, namely, the recent events inthe Ukraine. Thus, the probability that the Czech newspaper is reporting on areally existent document is raised considerably.Thus, what the document says about the Hungarian annexation of the CiscarpathianUkraine could be hugely significant, for this event has not yet occurred, andindeed, such an event might occur, and be argued for the as “the best solutionto stabilizing the western Ciscarpathian Ukraine.2. The Disturbing QuestionsThe reader will have noticed something else in the foregoing document, namely,that it stated, clearly and unequivocally, that the reunited Germany was notasking the Soviet Union to do certain things, but demanding that it do so. Thequestion is, what possible leverage did Germany have to in order to use suchlanguage against the Soviet Union which, despite its economic problems,possessed a huge nuclear and thermonuclear arsenal, indeed, the world’s largest.So again, whence came Chancellor Kohl’s confidence? Did it come simply from thebluster of “blackmail” diplomacy, or was there a reality backing it up? And ifso, what was it?One answer, of course, might lie in the nuclear and thermonuclear politics thatwe have encountered the German elite playing in previous chapters, including thevery sobering reality that Germany is already a de facto nuclear andthermonuclear power, since it is heavily involved in arming the French nuclearforce de frappe. But again, while France’s nuclear and thermonuclear arsenal(and whatever weapons Germany might secretly have squirrelled away) could dodevastating damage to either Russia or the USA, its mere hundreds of warheads,as opposed to Russia’s thousands, would not seem to carry enough “weight.”So what was the reality backing up Kohl’s demands, if there was any?For the answer to that, one must do some cosmic speculation…1 [text00014.html#fn_1] Christopher Storey, The European Union Collective: Enemyof its Member States: A Study in Russian and Germany Strategy to CompleteLenin’s World Revolution (London: Edward Harle, 2001), p. 160, emphasis in theoriginal.2 [text00014.html#fn_2] Bernard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe: The Dirtywar for Europe’s Money, p. 18.3 [text00014.html#fn_3] Joseph P.

The byzantine cunning of the Nazi scheme was simply to createa version of the BIS, then allow it to issue such credits in the Germancurrency, thus assuring a profound Nazi domination of the institution.11 [text00014.html#fn_11] Bernard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe: TheDirty War for Europe’s Money, p. vii.12 [text00014.html#fn_12] Storey, The European Union Collective, p. 169.13 [text00014.html#fn_13] Bernard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe, pp.231-232.14 [text00014.html#fn_14] Bernard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe, p. 201.15 [text00014.html#fn_15] Ibid., p. xii.16 [text00014.html#fn_16] Ibid., p. 240.17 [text00014.html#fn_17] Ibid. p. xi.18 [text00014.html#fn_18] Bernard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe, p. xvi.19 [text00014.html#fn_19] Ibid., emphasis added.20 [text00014.html#fn_20] Ibid., p. 17.21 [text00014.html#fn_21] Ibid., p. 10.22 [text00014.html#fn_22] Ibid., pp. 16-17.23 [text00014.html#fn_23] Bernard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe, p. 17.Connolly also notes that this question was deliberately left unanswered in theMaastricht treaty that led to the creation of the current structure of theEuropean Union. But as we shall argue in this chapter, on the basis ofConnolly’s own review of the ERM, while the battle between France and Germanyfor domination may have ended in a stalemate, that stalemate appears to beheavily weighted on the German side of the scales. This weighting, when combinedwith the data of previous chapters, would thus make it appear to be a marginalto tactical German victory within the struggle to dominate the EU.24 [text00014.html#fn_24] It is also worth pointing out that the Exchange RateMechanism came into existence through a series of secret negotiations heldbetween d’Estang and Helmut Schmidt, and that the Bundesbank was opposed tothese negotiations. (q.v. Connolly, op. cit., p. 9)25 [text00014.html#fn_25] Bernard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe, p.167-168.26 [text00014.html#fn_26] Ibid., p. 169.27 [text00014.html#fn_27] The Bundesbank’s remarkable independence from theGerman government itself led to many confrontations, and in fact the Bundesbankis widely regarded as having brought down the Schmidt government in response tothe latter’s secretive negotiations with d’Estang’s government in creating theExchange Rate Mechanism in the first place. This independence is, again,reminiscent of the Bank of International Settlements’ de facto sovereignty, andit prompted Connolly to ask “Why an unaccountable political role for such animportant institution is tolerated and even welcomed in German democracy is akey question…” (Connolly, op. cit., p. 253.)28 [text00014.html#fn_28] Ibid., p. 13.29 [text00014.html#fn_29] Bernard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe, p. xiv.30 [text00014.html#fn_30] Ibid., p. 383. Connolly observes that “The attempt ofcertain Euroenthusiasts to create such an enemy in the shape of the US and Japansmells nastily of 1984.” (p. 384.)31 [text00014.html#fn_31] Bernard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe, p. 379.32 [text00014.html#fn_32] Ibid.33 [text00014.html#fn_33] Ibid., p. 380. Note the use of the term “fealty,” aterm of feudalism with a specific legal meaning. Connolly’s use of it here ishardly accidental, for within the feudal system, one might owe “fealty”—i.e.,the obligation to raise a local armed force—in response to a local lord’s callfor it. Within this system, individual lords could owe fealty to several otherlords. This tapestry of contractual obligation—for fealty is a system ofcontractual obligation—could and did lead to conflicts when one lord called uponhis subordinates to make good on their obligations of support in conflicts withanother lord to whom they also owed support. Thus arose the concept of the“liege lord” to whom one owed the performance of such obligations when suchcontractual conflicts arose. Thus, the structure of the EU may be viewed as aliege-lord-system, to which one owes ultimate obligations of performance in thecase of more localized, i.e., national or regional, conflict.34 [text00014.html#fn_34] Ibid., pp. 386-387.35 [text00014.html#fn_35] Benard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe, p. 26.36 [text00014.html#fn_36] Ibid.37 [text00014.html#fn_37] Bernard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe, p. 28.38 [text00014.html#fn_38] Ibid., p. 30.39 [text00014.html#fn_39] Ibid., p. 32, emphasis added.40 [text00014.html#fn_40] Ibid., p. 31.41 [text00014.html#fn_41] Bernard Connolly, The Rotten Heart of Europe, p. 76,see also p. 210.42 [text00014.html#fn_42] See, for example, Bernard D.

The “containment” and “rollback” doctrine was also espoused byGerman General Reinhard Gehlen, wartime head of German military intelligence onthe Eastern Front, the Fremde Heere Ost (Foreign Armies East) unit of Germany’sAbwehr, raising the question of why America’s foreign policy at times seems soschizophrenic and counter-intuitive to American interests in a very stark form.Kennan was, of course, a key advisor to the Truman Administration, whichessentially put into places the long-term mechanisms of America’s postwarforeign policy, many of which persist to this day. One need think only of theCIA and NSA in this regard. We shall have occasion to explore other reasons forthis schizophrenia and counter-intuitive foreign policy in the next and finalpart of this book.72 [text00014.html#fn_72] Christopher Storey, The European Union Collective, p.205.73 [text00014.html#fn_73] At this juncture, Storey adds an editorial comment:“In the event, Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced in 1990 the final Germanrenunciation of any revision of the Oder-Neisse border with Poland. This is oneof the peculiar anomalies of this document; but it does not undermine itssignificance, given that the division of Czechoslovakia and the destabilisationand carve-up of Yugoslavia were accurately anticipated therein.” (p. 202)74 [text00014.html#fn_74] It is important to bear in mind that “compensation”could come in many forms, including bi-lateral trade agreements andtechnological assistance from Germany to Russia.75 [text00014.html#fn_75] Storey adds an editorial comment here: “Note: Thisrepresents confirmation that the Czech and Slovak ‘democracies’ are false,controlled exercises in Soviet ‘democratism’…” (Storey, The European UnionCollective, p. 203).76 [text00014.html#fn_76] The mention of the Treaty of Trianon, which endedWorld War One between the Allied and Associated Powers and Austria and Hungary,stipulated the current borders of Hungary. However, within the Dual Monarchy,the borders of the Kingdom of Hungary included most of Transylvania in theregion west of the Carpathian Mountains, now in Romania, while Slovakia was, ofcourse, incorporated into the Kingdom of Galicia within the Austrian part of theDual Monarchy. Thus, this component of the pact is essentially awarding Hungary,if it so chooses, the Slovakian component of the old Austrian Kingdom ofGalicia, plus the formerly Hungarian territories of Transylvania, now inRomania. Perhaps this alleged secret pact is therefore a hidden reason why theUnited States has based some troops in Romania, as a counter-weight to anypotential combined Russo-German-Hungarian pressures on Romania. In effect, whatthe pact is attempting to do is to recreate the Hungarian component of the DualMonarchy, while the Austrian component of it falls under the German sphere ofinfluence. This is, once again, perfectly consistent with German plans for aEuropean federation that were outlined during the First World War.77 [text00014.html#fn_77] Of Yugoslavia. Storey’s note on this point states “Assubsequently materialised in Yugoslavia” (Storey, The European Union Collective,p. 203).78 [text00014.html#fn_78] Christopher Storey, The European Union Collective, pp.202-203, bold emphasis, and italics emphasis, when appearing separately, areStorey’s.

That pantheon has grownconsiderably in the last few decades to include a bewildering array of fermions,bosons, muons, mesons, hadrons, gluons, quarks, strangelets and, on top of allthis, like all particles, these strange creatures are described by theirattributes, charge, mass, spin, and so on, though in many cases we now have newattributes whose mathematical abstruseness and abstraction are colloquiallyreferred to as “flavors” and “colors.” Even “charm” and “beauty” and “up” and“down” and “strange” have entered the vocabulary of particle attributes, as ifeven mathematics itself was no longer quite adequate and normal speech had totake over again and borrow words to allow physicists to talk about theever-growing family tree of their gods with their peculiar functions and theiralways copulating, rapidly multiplying rabbit’s warren of offspring. To observeor listen to the discussion from the sidelines it sounds a bit like a romancenovel, a bit like a class in art appreciation, and a bit like ordering icecream…with equations. Nor is the analogy to the pantheons of old entirelywithout purpose, for according to one hypothesis, just as ancient man invented anew “god” whose purpose was to govern whatever natural function or process hehad observed, quantum mechanics seems to invent a new particle to explain eachcluster of functional attributes. Have a bunch of particles that have theproperty of mass? Then there must be a particle (god) whose function it is toimpart mass to all the other particles(gods).And thus—with a great deal of teeth-grinding oversimplification—came thehypothesis of the “Higgs boson,” with which physicists, by nicknaming it “theGod particle,” have obligingly confirmed our “particle pantheon” analogy. This“Higgs boson” or “God particle” is supposedly one of the things that CERN’sLarge Hadron Collider was to look for, and which, supposedly, was one of thethings it has already allegedly found. However, as will be seen, it is the leastof the deities with which we are concerned.Indeed, for some scientists, the real deity is the Collider itself, and theterms used to describe it approach, in some cases, religious devotion. ForMartin Beech, a professor of astronomy at the University of Regina in Canada,the Collider represents a machine whose “intricate yet paradoxicallyparsimonious structure, along with its sheer scale” leaves one so “humbled” thatone “can do little but wonder” at the Large Hadron Collider. 5[text00015.html#fn5] But his adoration—some would say idolatry—does not stopthere, as his language lingers on the cusp of a kind of ecstasy as hecontemplates the wondrous vision: the Collider, he says, is “Europe’s exultantshrine to nuclear physics,” 6 [text00015.html#fn6] and, invoking a bit of OldTestament imagery, it is a “great leviathan” which is “now awake, roaring andfull of promise for the future.” 7 [text00015.html#fn7] Descending from themountain tops for a moment to share the details of how the glorious tabernaclewas constructed, Beech wraps his vision in more prosaic terms, before breakingout in adoration once again that we humans are fortunate to share the universewith such a mystery as this machine; the Collider, he states,…is the most complicated machine ever built by humanity. It dwarfs by comparisonanything else that has ever been constructed. Everything, including its size,technical complexity, scientific innovation, and exactitude of construction ison the grandest of scales. We are honored to live in an epoch when such amachine, if that really is the right name for the (Large Hadron Collider), canbe built. 8 [text00015.html#fn8]At the completely opposite end of the spectrum, German mathematician andneuroscientist Alexander Unzicker, a man whom some physicists regard assomething of a crank due to his almost total philosophical rejection of theStandard Model, also perceives the “religious” aspect of the situation, anaspect that he strongly suspects has moved physics into the realm of dogma. ForUnzicker, the Standard Model now comes complete with its own “parallels toreligion,” with its own temples in the form of ever-more-expensive particleaccelerators and colliders, for…it is also the impressive technology, the pure size, cost and shared effortinvested in the Large Hadron Collider that convinces people to believe in thestandard model. Today’s colliders have taken the role of medieval cathedrals.The harmonious singing in such a large building just cannot refer to atheoretical fantasy. 9 [text00015.html#fn9]What is intriguing here is that Beech, who certainly supports the StandardModel, and Unzicker, who clearly does not, both describe the enterprise inquasi-metaphysical terms. So what is going on, and where does the Large HadronCathedral fit in?Before we can answer that we must first deal and dispense with the otherrabbits’ warren: the numerous conspiracy theories that have sprouted concerningthe Large Hadron Collider. This is not to say that there are not things to besuspicious of regarding CERN’s mammoth machine, nor even that there might besome hidden and covert purposes for it. However, those concerns and thosepurposes can only be appreciated for their full significance after one haslooked at the salient features of the various conspiracy theories regarding it.As will be discovered, those theories have at least enough mass to cause somescientists to address them in their statements. And these statements in theirturn, show the evident signs of self-contradiction. At the end of thisexamination, we shall throw all caution to the winds, and offer our ownextremely tentative and speculative hypothesis about the collider, and what mayreally be going on. For that to make any sense, however, we have to (1)catalogue the conspiracy theories, (2) understand the collider and itsconstruction (albeit in a basic and rudimentary way), (3) have a rudimentarygrasp of the Standard Model of quantum mechanics and of its critics, andfinally, (4) a careful review of what scientists themselves have said abouttheir machine and its purposes, for those statements, when one reads between thelines, tell a much more extraordinary story than any conspiracy theory evercould.A.

Logos and Pictures: Grist for the Conspiracy MillThose conspiracy theories themselves are a veritable catalogue of “hadronhysteria,” and most of them get around to mentioning, at some point, CERN’s logofor its collider, which is suggestive, to say the very least:001 [Image00030.gif]The CERN Hadron Collider LogoA particle physicist viewing this logo would not think twice about it, for afterall, the only things depicted—if any things are being depicted at all—are twocircular colliders with five linear injection points, an apt schematic, as weshall see, for the fact that the Large Hadron Collider is in fact a series offive accelerators, one of which is a linear accelerator which gets the balls ofhadrons (in this case, protons, or, to be more precise, quarks), going. Othersof a more Christian persuasion are not so quick to accept such easy and facileexplanations however, for they quickly point out that the logo also has three 6sboldly encoded into the symbol, and 666, as anyone familiar with the Apocalypseof St. John (the Book of Revelations) will tell you, is the number of theAnti-Christ, the great Beast at the End of the World. For these conspiracytheorists, the very possibility that the Large Hadron Collider might besearching for the world-destroying strangelets of quark-gluon condensates,phenomena of quantum mechanics that some researchers call the “cousin to theblack hole,” 10 [text00015.html#fn10] or (worst of all) searching foranti-matter, is proof positive of the hidden occult and Satanic agenda behind itall. The problem is, as we shall see, CERN and various “conCERNed” scientistshave made statements that do not entirely help matters; to the contrary.A hermeticist or esotericist might look at the peculiar logo, however, and seenot three 6s, but rather, three 9s, and conclude that a subtle bow is being madeto the influence of hermetic doctrines on the rise of modern science in the formof Egypt’s Enneads(Nines) by an oblique symbolic reference to the nineprimordial neters or “gods” from which all existence arises; such persons mightbe inclined to view CERN’s stated goals, which are inclusive of the attempt tore-create some of the conditions of the “primordial plasma soup” that resultedfrom the Big Bang (the favorite cosmological theory of CERN defenders), as beinga form of alchemy.We are thus in the position of the three blind men examining the elephant, who,each feeling only one part of the beast, offer their individual piecemealdescriptions as lucid accounts of the whole, an enterprise not at all unlikeparticle physics, as we shall also see.The occult and/or hermetic conspiracies are aided and abetted by another curiouscircumstance, namely, the presence of a statue of the Hindu god Shiva, god/essof “creation and destruction,” outside its Large Hadron Collider headquarters:001 [Image00031.gif]The Statue of Shiva, Hindu God/ess of Creation and Destruction, at CERN’s LargeHadron Collider HeadquartersWhile creation and destruction of particles—not to mention heavy ioncollisions—are the bread and butter for the Large Hadron Collider, it does nothelp matters that Shiva’s creative and destructive activities arecosmically-sized and cosmological in nature, ushering in one new cosmos upon thedestruction of an older one. Shiva is the symbol of the powers of cosmiccreation and destruction, and thus, the Hindu god/ess’s presence at CERNsymbolizes for many the intention of the organization to grasp cosmic powers ofcreation and destruction through the Collider.As one might expect, since the Collider began its Shiva-like activities prior tothe hysteria about the Mayan calendar and its alleged prophecies that the worldwould end in 2012, it should come as no surprise that some people found an alltoo disheartening resemblance between the calendar itself, and one of the LargeHardon Collider’s “detectors,” when viewed on end:001 [Image00032.jpg]Comparison of the Mayan Calendar, on the left, and one of the Large HadronCollider Particle Detectors, on the rightb. A More Sobering Sampling of LunacyWhen one considers the conspiracy theories in closer detail, however, the gapsbetween the theories of their creators and those of the scientists growsnarrower. Indeed, it may be the case that this is one instance where that gap isquantifiable, and that what is in dispute are not the numbers, but their meaningand implications. One such theory that made the rounds and even found its wayinto mainstream media reporting was that the scientists were trying to recreatethe conditions of the Big Bang itself, and the state of all known matter in thefew nano-seconds after the event, or that they were attempting to create “miniblack holes” that would “devour the earth and eventually the universe.” 11[text00015.html#fn11] Yet another variant on this theory is that the diabolicalscientists of CERN were also trying to open hyper-dimensional “portals” throughwhich demons can come tumbling down to Earth. 12 [text00015.html#fn12] Somewhatdisconcertingly, having taken away with the left hand, the article gives backwith the right by noting that the scientists and technicians were indeed tryingto recreate “elements of the big bang,” in this case the “quark-gluon plasma,believed to be the first form of matter in the universe.” But all is well, CERNhas already done so, and “the world remains stubbornly undestroyed.” 13[text00015.html#fn13]Not to be outdone, CERN, on the way to destroying the world, took time off,according to yet another theory, to bring down Germanwings flight 9525 on March24, 2015 due to an accidental short-circuit in one of its magnets at the sameapproximate time that the flight crashed into the mountains some 125 miles southof the Collider. Critics, of course, quickly dispatched this theory by pointingout that there were doubtless other flights within 125 miles of the Colliderwhen the malfunction happened, and that it was unlikely that the fieldsgenerated by the device were strong enough to produce such an effect in anycase. After all, the two main elements of the Collider are located far beneaththe ground. 14 [text00015.html#fn14] Yet another theory flashed briefly as itwas eventually reviewed that the two Americans who perished on the flight wereYvonne Selke and her daughter Emily, as conspiracy theorists pointed out thatYvonne Selke was an employee for Booze Allen Hamilton, Inc., a leadingcontractor to the U.S. Government in security and data processing andmanagement. 15 [text00015.html#fn15] Rounding out all the lunacy, there is evenan attempt to view the Large Hadron Collider and its experiments from an“eco-feminist” point of view. 16 [text00015.html#fn16]2. More Credible Cautionary NotesAs was seen in the previous section, at the heart of the conspiracy theories areallegations that the Collider will produce something—whether mini black holes,quark-gluon plasmas or “strangelets”—that will eventually destroy the Earth, andpossibly the world. Here, the story is more complicated then CERN would perhapscare to admit, for as has also been noted, these theories—some of them voiced bycompetent scientists such as Otto E. Roessler, Professor of TheoreticalBiochemistry and chaos theory at Germany’s University of Tübingen 17[text00015.html#fn17] —became so vocal that court cases were actually initiatedin the USA and Germany to stall the Collider from being switched on, forcing oneGerman court to plea for a safety review of the entire project 18[text00015.html#fn18] from more objective quarters than merely CERN’s own blandassurances that absolutely nothing could go wrong.The controversies even made it into the mainstream media. The New Yorkermagazine, for example, carried a lengthy article by Elizabeth Kolbert, whichsummed up the controversy, and how it originated in the USA’s BrookhavenNational Laboratory’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC):CERN’s chief scientific officer, Jos Engelen, is from the Netherlands. He servesunder the director general, who is from France, and alongside the chieffinancial officer, who is from Germany. I went to speak to Engelen in hisoffice; behind his desk is a chart (which) indicated when the various parts ofthe collider are supposed to be completed. It was a crazy quilt of multicoloredblocks, with lines radiating in all directions. Engelen greeted me with ahalf-ironic cheerfulness that struck me as very Dutch. Among hisresponsibilities is dealing with the frequent calls and letters CERN receivesabout the possibility that the Large Hardon Collider will destroy the world.When I asked about this, Engelen picked up a Bic pen and placed it in front ofme.“In quantum mechanics, there is a probability that this pen will fall throughthe table,” he said. “All of a sudden, it will be on the floor. Because it canbehave as a wave, it can go through; we call that the ‘tunnel effect.’ If youcalculate the probability that this happens, it is not identical to zero. It isa very small probability. But it never happens. I’ve never seen it happen. Youhave never seen it happen. But to the general public you make a casual remark,‘It is not identical to zero, it is very small,’ and…” He shrugged.Worries about the end of the planet have shadowed nearly every high-energyexperiment. Such concerns were given a boost by Scientific American —presumablyinadvertently—in 1999. That summer, the magazine ran a letter to the editorabout Brookhaven’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, then nearing completion. Theletter suggested that the Brookhaven collider might produce a “mini black hole”that would be drawn toward the center of the earth, thus “devouring the entireplanet within minutes.” Frank Wilczek, a physicist who would later win a NobelPrize, wrote a response for the magazine. Wilczek dismissed the idea of miniblack holes devouring the earth, but went on to raise a new possibility: thecollider could produce strangelets, a form of matter that some think might existat the center of neutron stars. In that case, he observed, “one might beconcerned about an ‘ice-9’-type transition,” wherein all surrounding mattercould be converted into strangelets and the world as we know it would vanish.Wilczek labelled his own suggestion “not plausible,” but the damage had beendone. “BIG BANG MACHINE COULD DESTROY EARTH” ran the headline in the LondonTimes. Brookhaven was forced to appoint a committee to look into this and otherdisaster scenarios. (The committee concluded that “we are safe from a strangeletinitiated catastrophe.”)“I know Frank Wilczek,” Engelen told me. “He is an order of magnitude smarterthan I am. But he was perhaps a bit naïve.” Engelen said that CERN officials arenow instructed, with respect to the L.H.C.’s world-destroying potential, “not tosay that the probability is very small but that the probability is zero. 19[text00015.html#fn19]There are two important points to take away from this brief history.Firstly, the problem was not the creation of “mini black holes,” but rather,their “cousin,” the strange quark-gluon condensate or plasma, aptly named a“strangelet,” which would eventually suck all matter into contact with it,converting it all to a hyper-dense lump or sphere of matter with the mass of astar, but compacted into a very small volume of space, less than the size of theplanet Earth, not quite a black hole, but the nearest thing to it.Secondly, as Dr. Engelen of CERN himself admitted, the probability was notactually zero, but vanishingly small, so small it might be analogous to winninga multi-million dollar lottery three times in a row: vanishingly small, butstill not zero.Consequently, it was under these circumstances that the controversy continued,and gathered occasional dissenting voices within the scientific community as tothe wisdom of “turning on” the Large Hadron Collider. Simultaneously, otherpeople began closely tracking CERN’s actual statements. One of them was EricPenrose, who caught CERN in a case of “spinning” its reports (no pun intended),if not of outright contradiction. “According to CERN’s safety page,” Penrosewrote,‘Strangelet production at the (Large Hadron Collider) is therefore less likelythan at (Brookhaven’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider), and experience there (atRHIC) has already validated the arguments that strangelets cannot be produced.’In 2008, the (Large Hadron Collider) Safety Assessment Group (LSAG) produced areport claiming that: ‘The previous argument about the impossibility to producestrangelets at the (Large Hadron Collider) are confirmed.’ 20[text00015.html#fn20]Everything’s ok. CERN is not trying to produce “strangelets.” Nothing to seehere. Move along. Right?Wrong, for according to Penrose, the Large Hadron Collider had planned projectsfor the detection of strangelets, thus indicating that it was tacitlyacknowledging the possibility, however small, that they might be produced in itsparticle beam collisions:But is can now be shown that claims in the safety report about thenon-production of strangelets—are in clear contradiction with two experimentsresearch projects for the (Large Hadron Collider). Theoretical or technicalarticles, presentations and online material relating to (Large Hadron Collider)detector work have been identified, stating that the production of strangeletsis either a likely prospect or a serious possibility at the (Large HadronCollider).…(Two Large Hadron Collider Safety Assessment Group) members—includingits chair—have been involved with the Large Hadron Collider Committee, and theminutes from that committee’s meetings imply their familiarity with these CERNstrangelet detection projects. In 1996 the later (Large Hadron Collider SafetyAssessment Group’s) chair was a referee assigned to the ALICE detector that wasassociated at that time with both these projects when they were proposals. Infact, four out of five of the of the (Large Hadron Collider Safety AssessmentGroup) report authors for the final version, were at that time members of CERN’sTheory Division.One of these projects is in fact a self-contained detector subsystem that ispresently installed and operational as part of one of the (Large HadronCollider’s) four main detector systems—the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS). Thisdetector is called CASTOR, short for ‘Centauro And Strange Object Research.’Another strangelet search project is associated with the ALICE detector.…It is not claimed here that these researchers state that there are dangers,nevertheless, the bases for CERN’s remaining safety assurances are also shown tobe doubted or contradicted by the published statements of model projections ofseveral physicists. 21 [text00015.html#fn21]It should be noted that Penrose’s article includes a detailed table, plusscreen-capture exhibits documenting his allegations.Here the mystery deepens yet again, however, for when one searches for thealleged CASTOR strangelet detector experiment on CERN’s site, one discovers thatthere is a project with the acronym CASTOR, but according to CERN, it stands for“Cern Advanced STORage manager,” which is “a hierarchical storage managementsystem which was developed at CERN for managing physics data files.” 22[text00015.html#fn22]Apparently Penrose ran into this difficulty as well, for in his article, hemakes a rather curious statement about it:Without prior knowledge of this detector, information about it from CERN wouldonly be traced with difficulty, from within the extended resources of the ‘CERNDocument Server’ or deep within the CMS(Compact Muon Solenoid) website (such aswith the results within the newsletter archives of CMS Times—or from the CMSwebsite for CASTOR that is given a reference from an article. 23[text00015.html#fn23]Let us assume for the moment and for the sake of argument that both versions ofthe meaning of the CASTOR acronym—“Cern Advanced STORage manager” and “CentauroAnd Strange Object Research”—are true, and that the latter meaning denotes somehidden or secret detector system embedded within the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)detector at the Collider.What might this dual-use of one acronym mean?One clear possible implication is that one project, a hidden and covert one todetect strangelets, thereby admitting the (probabilistically) remote possibilitythat the Collider will produce them, is nested within a completely differentproject, one having to do with the management of the truly massive amounts ofdata that the Large Hadron Collider will produce. Bear this connection betweendata management and the possibility of secret projects nested or disguisedwithin the public ones in mind, for it will bear fruit later in this chapter.For the moment, however, consider the other implication of this possibility,namely, that by organizing a detection experiment, and paying for the costlydetection equipment with which to perform and observe such an experiment, CERNis admitting that it might not only produce them, but with the covert projectimplication, that it might actually be attempting to produce them.At this juncture, we return once again to Prof. Dr. Otto Roessler, whom weencountered earlier in conjunction with lawsuits brought before German courts todelay the Large Hadron Collider from coming online before a more objectivesafety committee could review the whole project. After all, being reassured ofthe safety of a device solely by the very people involved in its construction,maintenance, and operation it would seem, in the realm of jurisprudence atleast, to be a conflict of interest.Under Roessler’s influence, other people, among them Eric Penrose as we haveseen, began to examine the Collider, and for some, the mere possibility—even ifvanishingly small from a statistical point of view—of the production ofstrangelets or quark-gluon condensates, meant that the CERN machine was a kindof “super-quark cannon” whose circular path allowed a “muzzle velocity” (toextend the cannon analogy) near light velocity, allowing protons and heavy ionsto be collided at tremendous energies after being whirled around in theCollider’s enormous magnetic fields (about which, more later in this chapter).Thus, the Collider is really a machine of planetary scale, effect, andinfluence, for by colliding particle beams each of which contain protons (or,worse, heavy lead ions) zipping along at nearly the velocity of light, means,according to these theorists, that they areEssentially equivalent to the ‘singularity’ of a Kerr black hole—a rotatingc-speed charged ring of mass. Since a Kerr singularity can produce transversalgravitational waves, the (Large Hadron Collider) might produce perpendiculargravitational waves that will sink straight towards the center of the Earth… Ifso these Gravitational waves, which are undetectable, will affect magneticfields, provoking earthquakes waves and increase volcano activity. 24[text00015.html#fn24]According to these conspiracy theorists, such earthquakes will increase inmagnitude and quantity, eventually reaching 8 and even 9 on the Richter scale.In short, the public face of the project—a huge experiment in particle physicsand quantum mechanics—masks a hidden project, one having little to do withparticles and everything to do with gravity and the creation of potentiallyworld-destroying matter. 25 [text00015.html#fn25]All this, the theorists point out, is taking place in a Collider with energycollisions first in the 7 tera-election-volt, with plans for collisions in the15 tera-electron-volt energy range. And if all this be true of the current LargeHadron Collider with its twenty-seven kilometer circumference, imagine whatmight happen once CERN builds its planned one hundred kilometer circumferenceCollider that will produce particle beam collisions in the 100tera-electron-volt range! 26 [text00015.html#fn26] And as if all that were notenough, prominent CERN Large Hadron Collider project member nation Germany, thelargest financial contributor to the project, 27 [text00015.html#fn27] hasannounced its plans to build its FAIR collider (Facility for Antiproton and IonResearch), in Darmstadt, with cooperation from France, the United Kingdom,Russia, and India. 28 [text00015.html#fn28] Antiprotons are the antimatterequivalent of protons, and matter-antimatter reactions are total annihilationreactions, producing enormous amounts of energy per collision. Could oneconsequently be looking at projects whose true and covert purpose is a militaryone, one designed to produce the ultimate explosives, far beyond the energyproduction of the fusion reactions of hydrogen bombs that are produced by thecolliding nuclei of heavy hydrogen and lithium? 29 [text00015.html#fn29]B. Deeper Persisting Patterns and Contexts: Finance and Physics1. An Ancient and Modern Example of a PatternTo answer this question, we must consider the larger context of the Collider notonly with the pattern of the European Union and its projects, but the financialand corporate cartels that have been examined in previous chapters, that is tosay, we must situate the Collider within a much larger historical pattern, onestretching back to ancient times, and manifest in much more detail during theNazi period. In ancient times the connection between the high financial power,religion, and technological projects was clear, for according to some, ancienttemples might have operated as simple radio resonant cavities capable of sendingand receiving telegraphy, and the temples also functioned as centers offinancial activity. 30 [text00015.html#fn30] More recently, the alignmentbetween the high financial power, in the form of the House of Morgan, andadvanced technology, in the form of Nikola Tesla’s Wardenclyffe project for thewireless transmission of power, and its potential weaponization possibilities,are well known. 31 [text00015.html#fn31]2. Working in Monstrous Areas of Physics on a Daily Basis:a. The Nazi ContextThere is, however, a pattern much closer to the Collider, and that is thepattern of fascist doctrine and organization networked with, and hiding behindand within, large corporate and cartel structures, a nexus first disclosed inthe 1944 secret meeting between high ranking Nazi Party officials and Germanindustrialists at the Hotel Maison Rouge meeting Strasbourg, France, in 1944,and continued, as we have seen in previous chapters, after the war. 32[text00015.html#fn32] Viewed differently, the limited sovereignty and statusgranted to corporations in most systems of Western jurisprudence, allowed themto be used by fascist groups, including the Nazi party, as a means to preservetheir own sovereign status. The large cartels of interwar German capitalism withtheir huge base of capitalization, their international extent and their globalreach into all aspects of their industries via patents and licensing agreements,made those cartels and corporations the perfect host organisms by which fascistideologies and parties could not only survive, but flourish and grow, even tothe point of the postwar continuation of secret Nazi advanced technologyresearch projects, such as Dr. Ronald Richter’s “fusion” project in PeronistArgentina. 33 [text00015.html#fn33]Nor was Richter’s project an isolated phenomenon. Author and Nazi researcherPeter Levenda has recently pointed out that the notorious Nazi colony in Chile,Cologna Dignidad, was involved in the research and manufacture of chemicalweapons of mass destruction, such as Sarin gas. 34 [text00015.html#fn34] Whilethe infamous colony was ostensibly closed down years ago by the Chileangovernment in response to increasing global attention to the colony, thephysical plant nonetheless survives, as does a curious corporate structure nowengaged in the construction and operation of an amusement park! Given the “HotelMaison Rouge Pattern” of utilizing corporations and cartels as the vehicle forthe survival of party ideology, organization, and goals, one does have toentertain the possibility that the colony simply assumed a new front, and newmanagement.b. The KammlerstabYet another pattern lurks in the general historical context, one which perhapsholds much more potential significance for the present subject underconsideration than would first appear. Shortly after the Nazi annexation ofBohemia-Moravia, the entire region was made a Reichprotektorat and placed underthe jurisdiction of the SS in the form of one of its most notorious killers,Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich. Within this SS preserve, there were furthercircles of security, all of them surrounding a super-secret organization calledthe Kammlerstab, the “Kammler Staff.” This entity was housed within theengineering division of the world-famous Skoda armaments works in Pilsen. WhatKrupp was to Germany in the First World War, Skoda was to Austria-Hungary. Thisspecial SS staff was a research staff coordinating all aspects of secret weaponsresearch within the Third Reich, from its advanced aircraft and missileprojects, stealthy submarines and materials research, acoustic torpedoes,lasers, nuclear and thermonuclear research from the atom bomb to an even moresecret project known as the Bell, researching thermonuclear plasma researchhaving possible applications in everything from engineering the vacuum flux orzero point energy, to anti-gravity.All of this was coordinated by one man behind a triple belt of Gestapocounter-intelligence security, SS Obergruppenführer Hans Kammler. In effect,Kammler had established a super-secret weapons “think tank,” the Nazi equivalentof the Defense Advance Projects Research Agency in the U.S.A. Nor does itstretch the bounds of possibility to suspect that the Kammlerstab had aninfluence on the organization and mission brief of the postwar American blackadvanced projects think tank. This “exotic technology secret weapons think tank”even circulated a private top secret journal of all the scientists’ andtechnicians’ research papers to each other, allowing them to brainstorm theoutlines of the technology tree to second and third generations weapons systems.In addition to this, Kammler was also in charge of the entire SS Building andWorks Department, and as such, had immediate jurisdiction within gruesomenetwork of Nazi Germany’s concentration camps and the vast pool of millions ofslave laborers available in them. 35 [text00015.html#fn35] As I have arguedelsewhere, this interface of advanced technology research with the SS system ofconcentration camps tells us something quite important about the Kammlerstab,for it could tap into a virtually inexhaustible supply of slave labor that couldbe permanently terminated with impunity ones its usefulness was over. This wasnowhere more in evidence than at the huge IG Farben “buna” plant at Auschwitz, aplant that others have argued elsewhere may have been in part a plant for theenrichment of nuclear isotopes. 36 [text00015.html#fn36]Consequently, if one looks at this picture from the standpoint of the patternsevident in the previous chapters, an unusual outline begins to emerge, for onehas:1)The disguising of super-secret projects within the public front of theengineering division of an internationally renowned armaments manufacturer,Skoda;2)A huge component of “civil engineering” being coordinated by the same entity,building the massive underground structures and factories for the Nazi-cartelempire, the SS Building and Works Department. Indeed, one may view theKammlerstab as a “secret weapons cartel” in and of itself;3)A secret “journal” or “magazine” circulating the secret papers and research ofthe scientists and technicians within the Kammlerstab, that is to say, amechanism was put into place to control and orchestrate the flow of data withinthe various projects coordinated by the Kammlerstab; and finally,4)A triple belt of Gestapo counter-intelligence security surrounds the wholeentity, which like all such counter intelligence security operations, would havemade use of techniques of disinformation to spin any public perceptions of theentity, and to spin the interpretation of any leaked data, if and when thatarose.There is more, however, and with this component, one has a final bit of thepattern.After the war, a British intelligence agent managed to penetrate just a littleinto the black projects and exotic technology world of the Kammlerstab. Thisindividual informed German researchers that there had been a team of scientistsand technicians within the Kammler’s secret weapons empire that were working “ina field that was monstrous on a daily basis,” in areas the normal public wouldview as “unthinkable and unbelievable, and thus imaginary,” because thismonstrous field had “totally abandoned conventional physical laws.” 37[text00015.html#fn37] Whatever this “monstrous” area that “totally abandonedconventional physical laws” may have been, the implication of the allegations isthat this team was working on something with truly global or cosmicpotentialities for destruction, a kind of Dr. Strangelove Doomsday device. Afterall, Kammler’s group was a secret weapons group. One may thus add a fifthcomponent:5)At the deepest level of security within Kammler’s group, behind all the othersecret projects involving missiles, lasers, nuclear and thermonuclear research,there is some group working on something with possibly global or cosmicweaponization potential.With the DARPA-esque pattern of the Kammlerstab in hand, we must now considerone final, highly technological component, one that very clearly becameconnected to the highest echelons of wartime and postwar technological research:the work of Hungarian electrical engineering genius, Gabriel Kron.c. Another Necessary Look at Gabriel KronCERN’s Large Hardon Collider is a gigantic machine designed to probe the tiniestreaches of the Standard Model of quantum mechanics, and, in doing so, to probethe earliest moments of the cosmological material prima, the plasma soup thatexisted just a few moments after the Big Bang. As such, it is no ordinaryelectrical machine.But it is still an electrical machine nonetheless, a machine of other networkedand nested electrical machines, all designed to interface in a complex manner toaccomplish its stated purposes. As such, it would have been the ultimate playingfield for Gabriel Kron’s ideas. In essence, Kron developed a system of theanalysis of electrical machines that he called “diakoptics,” whereby the machinewas torn apart into its constituent and simplest components, and thesecomponents then analyzed and their equations derived. Once these were derived,the connections of the simple components could then be recombined in theiroriginal state, and these connections described by the mathematical technique oftensor analysis.This technique arose in Kron’s mind because—as he himself pointed out—thescientist Kirchoff was led to create the mathematical languages of higher ordertopologies precisely as a result of his study of networked electrical machines.38 [text00015.html#fn38] That is to say—and this point cannot be stressedstrongly enough—all electrical machines, without exception, are manifestationsof higher dimensional realities, and no one better appreciated this fact thanGabriel Kron.Kron’s appreciation of this fact led him to develop a universe of bizarre ideas,including the idea that cosmological physics could best be approached from asimilar point of view, from that of systems theory, as a vastcrystalline-magnetic network of electrical machines which could be understood byhigher dimensional topologies, and then manipulated by those same topologies. 39[text00015.html#fn39] Kron thus understood that a whole field of “quantumcharacterized crystal computers” 40 [text00015.html#fn40] beckoned, and at theend of his life was seeking to apply his methods of systems theory and tensoranalysis to the construction of a “Generalized Crystal Optics” and “thehierarchy of self-organizing polyhedral waves” and even a “ ‘multidimensionalgeneralization’ of the sciences used by electrical engineers.” 41[text00015.html#fn41] Not surprisingly, Kron’s concepts were applied to nuclearengineering. 42 [text00015.html#fn42]What all of this means is that specific electrical machines were all examples ofa Generalized Electrical Machine whose properties were described by theequations of electromagnetics. Specific electrical machines, in mathematicalanalysis, were but collections “of numerous multi-dimensional spaces connectedtogether into one unit…” 43 [text00015.html#fn43] There are two enormousconsequences of this view.First, each part, or sub-system of any structure could have its own type ofspace, for example, different parts might be concerned with different kinds ofenergy. Secondly, the inter-connections could be broken, leaving isolatedsub-spaces, without causing the space structure as a whole, to collapse. 44[text00015.html#fn44]Thus, Kron’s method of applying higher order topologies to electrical machinesmeant that the “generalized electrical machine” was the elementary componentwhich, via tensor analysis, could be combined to create any type of machine onewished, and this machine, as a result, was a network of connectedmultidimensional spaces connected by an electrical machine in the “realthree-dimensional world.” Vary some of those components, such as voltage oramperage—or, in the case of the Collider—the collision energies of variousparticles (which are, in the mathematical descriptions of quantum mechanics,their own kind of extremely tiny “electrical” machines), and one varies themulti-dimensional spaces connected in and by the machine. Viewed in this“Kronian” fashion, the focus—which in the case of the conspiracy theories, andthe statements of CERN itself is on the particles and experiments themselves—shifts from “what are they observing,” the particles, to “what are theyobserving with,” the machine. Here, there are intriguing possibilities, if onewants to read between the lines.C. CERN’s Large Hadron Collider: The Machine of the Cosmology Cartel1. Preliminary ObservationsThe religious language with which some have eulogized, and some excoriated, theCollider points out one of one of those very obvious things whose potentialsignificance may not be immediately apparent until someone points out thatobviousness. That obviousness may in its turn be elucidated by asking a seriesof simple questions:1)Where is a complete master list of all the contractors who built eachcomponent of the Collider and its detectors, and how much did each cost?2)Where is a complete master list of all the scientists who have contributedpapers to the project, or been involved in some aspect of its planning,implementation, and ongoing experimentation and analysis?3)Where is a complete master list of all the technicians and engineers who havebeen involved in the design and planning of the project? Whose names, so tospeak, appear on the blueprints of its components?Occasionally one can discover articles on this or that component of the Colliderand of its cost, journey, and installation into the machine. But comprehensivedetails—even comprehensive summaries—are curiously rare, and those that do existare curiously devoid of details.By the best estimations, the cost of the Collider, when all was said and done,was somewhere between 6 and 6½ billion dollars, and this fact raises yet anotherone of those obvious questions, for such expenditures are more typical ofmilitary projects, than simply of a project to collect the quantum-mechanicalequivalent of butterflies and pin them to a taxonomical chart. Suchconsiderations may even rationalize one reason why the Collider is eulogized insuch glowing terms by many in the scientific community, for how better to divertattention from noticing this uncomfortable resemblance between the large scalecost of the Collider and military expenditures than to cast it in the evocativelanguage of religion? The Collider is a modern cathedral, no further inquiry orspeculation needed.2. The International Physics Equivalent of the Bank of International SettlementsDigging into what financial and management arrangements are publicly available,however, is particularly revealing, especially when considered in the context ofthe previous chapters of this book. It should come as no surprise, for example,that the largest single national contributor to CERN is Germany. 45[text00015.html#fn45] The United Kingdom, similarly, is another largecontributor, and these two nations successfully implemented changes in themanagement of the Collider so that CERN council voting procedures were changedto require double majorities, giving “more weight to the large contributors sothat they could keep control.” 46 [text00015.html#fn46] Consequently, whateverthe religious eulogizing rhetoric of international scientific cooperation mightbe regarding CERN and its Collider, the financial and political reality behindthat rhetoric is something very different: the major European powers, the U.K.,France, Germany, Italy, are very much in control.But there is one consideration above all others that indicates there may be muchmore to the Collider project and the possibilities of hidden or covert purposesfor it, than meets the eye:As an international organization, CERN is not a legal entity under national lawbut governed by public international law, The Member States have recognized theinternational status of CERN (via Host state Agreements with Switzerland andFrance, and a Protocol on Privileges and Immunities with the other memberstates). These agreements ensure that CERN benefits from immunity from nationaljurisdiction and execution. Thus, legal disputes between CERN and its suppliersand contractors are not submitted to national courts but solved viainternational arbitration. They also enable CERN to function withoutinterference by individual Member States and guarantee independence fromnational authorities. For our discussion this means that CERN is thus entitledto establish its own internal rules necessary for its proper functioning, suchas the rules under which it purchases equipment and services. 47[text00015.html#fn47]This cannot be pondered too long, for the implications are clear:1)CERN is an international sovereign entity, much like the Bank of InternationalSettlements, for like the bank, it was constructed by international agreement of“member states” certain of whom carry more “weight” in the system than others;2)Like the Bank of International Settlements, CERN is immune from individualnational oversight and can “establish its own internal rules necessary for itsproper functioning,” especially concerning “the rules under which it purchasesequipment and services.”a)This point means that it is entirely possible that CERN could run a hiddenproject within the public one, for in effect the grant of sovereign status meansthat it is a “quantum mechanics” or “cosmology cartel,” answerable to no one.This type of financial organization is the sine qua non of secret militaryprojects;b)Additionally, consideration of these cartel-like arrangements, plus theinternational “sovereign” status of the Collider, and a comparison with the Bankof International Settlements means, in effect, that the Collider organization isits own “bank,” and in this it symbolizes almost perfectly that pattern,persistent from ancient times, of the close alignment and alliance of thefinancial power with the “metaphysical,” “religious,” or “cosmological” one.CERN, and its Collider, are the BIS of particle physics, a veritable cosmologycartel;c)Thus, one also finds the reason that the various court cases in variouscountries that were brought to halt the Collider from being “switched on” weredoomed to fail, since national courts had no jurisdiction whatsoever over theCollider, and therefore those bringing the suits had no standing before thecourts to do so. 48 [text00015.html#fn48] Indeed, in an international court suitthey probably would not have legal standing to do so either, since as citizensof individual nations, and not “citizen-scientists” of the Collider experimentitself, they again fall outside the relevant jurisdiction.Under these circumstances, it should be clear that the possibility exists for acovert project behind the public one.a. CERN’s Procurement ProceduresIf this connection between the Collider as a “cosmology cartel” and bank seemscontrived, a closer look at its procurement procedures reveals the bank, or moreaccurately the trust, that is carefully concealed and squatting right in themiddle of the whole project. As planning for the Collider proceeded throughoutthe 1990s, it quickly became clear that deficits in the budget for theCollider’s huge, and hugely expensive, magnets and detectors, would have to befinanced by loans, and this required that CERN be able to take out loans. 49[text00015.html#fn49]As always, the crucial factor for investors, was minimization of risk to thesuppliers contracting to build its various components, 50 [text00015.html#fn50]and with such a complex instrument as the Collider, clear and streamlinedprocurement procedures were thus as essential to the project’s success as wereprecise calculations and precise engineering. The key risk factor for potentialsuppliers building the complex components of the machine was due simply to thefact that “significant technologies, production methods and instruments did notyet exist at the starting time of the project.” 51 [text00015.html#fn51] Inaddition to this, the project financing also “had to take national interestsinto account and ensure a fair industrial return to the Member States.” 52[text00015.html#fn52]The ability to take out loans and write its own procurement procedures in orderto minimize risks to its suppliers, coupled with the “sovereign” status as aninternational organization means in effect that CERN is, to some extent, its owncentral bank and trust which, like the BIS, is backed by the central banks ofits member states.b. The Disturbing Similarity of CERN’s Procurement Procedures to the ExchangeRate MechanismNothing underscores the point that CERN becomes a kind of “central bank andtrust for particle physics” than the peculiar procedures that were designed tominimize these risks to suppliers, and to provide returns to the member states.In December of 1993, a finance working group within CERN:submitted a report with s set of proposals that were unanimously approved by theCouncil after recommendation by the Finance Committee. The most importantelements of the new procurement procedures were as follows:1.The goals of the general procurement policy were defined to be threefold:•To ensure that bids fulfill all the necessary technical, financial and deliveryrequirements;•to keep overall costs for CERN as low as possible;•to achieve well balanced industrial return coefficients for all the memberStates.2.All CERN contracts were to be divided into two separate classes—supplycontracts and industrial service contracts.3.National interests would be protected by a system of target returncoefficients, defined for both supply contracts…and industrial servicescontracts.…4.For the purposes of adjudication of supply contracts/industrial servicescontracts, a Member State was to be considered poorly balanced if its supplycontract/industrial service contract return coefficient fell below 0.8 and 0.4respectively, well balanced if it was equal to or greater than the value.5.For contracts exceeding 200,000 Swiss francs in value, CERN was to applyalignment rules which, under certain well-defined conditions, allowed a bidderoffering goods/services originating in poorly balanced Member States to alignhis price to that of the lowest bidder and thereby be awarded the contract,provided that the bid with the realigned price complied with all the stipulatedrequirements. 53 [text00015.html#fn53]These procedures so strongly resemble the Exchange Rate Mechanism thatmanipulated the value of European nations’ currencies via a peg to theDeutschmark and pre-established exchange rate fluctuations, that one can onlywonder if in fact the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the Collider planning were notintentionally connected at some deep and covert level, symbolizing yet anotherinstance of the pattern of the connection of finance and physics. Indeed, if onedoes not see the resemblance between the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the CERNprocurement procedures, then all one has to do is to substitute the words“currency” and “currencies” for “goods” and “services” in the above quotation,and the similarity becomes immediately evident.3. The Stated Purposes of the Large Hadron ColliderSo what exactly is the Collider, and what are its ostensible purposes?The Collider itself, as most people know, is a ring of some 17 miles (27kilometers) circumference in which two beams of heavy particles, in this caseprotons, members of the heavy particle family along with neutrons called“hadrons,” are spun in opposite directions in two beams around the track, andthen collided at various points around the ring, at which are placed verysophisticated “cameras” or detectors which then “photograph” the debris from thecollisions. Why these “photographs” are important will be discussedsubsequently. The Collider, however, is the last in a series of fiveaccelerators which, linked together, accelerate the proton beam to higher andhigher energies and acceleration until they are injected into the Collideritself for final acceleration, and then collision. What enables these protons toachieve this high acceleration by the surrounding magnets is the phenomenon ofsuperconductivity, wherein a rotating electrical current in a medium cooled tonear absolute zero, encounters no electrical resistance and hence, no losses topower. The magnets of the Collider are cooled by 130 tons of liquid helium. 54[text00015.html#fn54] For those paying attention, one now has two of thefunctional elements of the Nazi Bell experiment: counter-rotation, and cryogeniccooling for superconductivity. 55 [text00015.html#fn55] The magnets providingall this energy are 1,800 super-conducting “twin-aperture main dipole andquadrupole magnets,” and these magnets amounted to “approximately 50% of thevalue” of the Collider itself. 56 [text00015.html#fn56]The purpose for all this technology is, in part, to investigate thematter-antimatter asymmetry in the “LHCb “detector”, about which moremomentarily. 57 [text00015.html#fn57] Additionally, however, it is admitted thatBy colliding beams of lead ions, the LHC will be able to produce a state ofmatter that only existed a few millionths of a second after the big band. Theproperties of the so-called quark-gluon plasma can be studied in detail in thespecially built ALICE detector (an acronym for A Large Ion ColliderExperiment).… 58 [text00015.html#fn58]The quark-gluon plasma or “strangelets” were, of course, at the center of theconcerns of “conspiracy theories,” so now one has an intriguing picture, for atone point, the search for such things was being denied, then that changed fromvanishingly low to zero probability for the sake of public relations, but now,in a review of the Collider, it is admitted that there is an active search fortheir creation by the ALICE detector!But this is not all.It is also admitted that the Collider will look for particles of so-called “darkmatter,” and for evidence of a new or different physics beyond that of theStandard Model, 59 [text00015.html#fn59] including extra dimensions, 60[text00015.html#fn60] a point that will become quite significant to our ownextremely speculative hypothesis of what might be going on with the Collider.With these specific purposes in mind, then the overall ostensible purpose of theCollider becomes clear:The fundamental scientific purpose of the (Large Hadron Collider) is to explorethe inner structure of matter and the forces that govern its behavior, andthereby understand better the present content of the Universe and its evolutionsince the Big Bang, and possibly into the future…. It will be a microscope ableto explore the inner structure of matter on scales an order of magnitude smallerthan any previous collider. The energies involved in these proton-protoncollisions will be similar to those in particle collisions in the firsttrillionth of a second in the history of the Universe. By studying theseprocesses in the laboratory, the LHC experiments will, in a sense, be lookingfurther back into time than is possible with any telescope. 61[text00015.html#fn61]In other words, the fundamental purpose of the Collider is cosmological, it isto give an insight into the structures of the universe, including thematter-antimatter asymmetry, the creation and observation of strangelets,hyperdimensional spaces, and so on. And when insight comes, manipulation comesnot far behind.4. The Proton Path and the Detectorsa. A Brief Summary of the Standard ModelIn order to understand these ostensible purposes of the Collider, one must havea basic grasp of some aspects of the Standard Model of quantum mechanics, andthen of the various sub-systems of the Collider itself, breaking it down intoits components in a manner similar to Kron’s “diakoptics.”The first and most important point to understand is that the particles of theStandard Model—quarks, gluons, and such—are less particles in the standard“billiard ball” sense, than they are sets of “information” or attributes thatare all described mathematically. Within these mathematical descriptions, theStandard Model has two types of fundamental particles, leptons, and hadrons.Leptons are the relatively “massless” particles whose mass is very very small,such as the electron and electron neutrino (and, of course, when one brings intothe picture their antimatter opposites, the positron, which has not a negativecharge, but a positive one, but the same mass as an electron). Hadrons are muchheavier particles, like the proton, but these are composed, according to themodel, of further “sub-particles” called quarks.Crucial to the theory that hadrons were in their turn composed of other smallerparticles called quarks, was the insight of physicist De Broglie, who arguedthat if energy in the form of light could be viewed as both a wave and aparticle, then matter itself might be viewed as both a particle and a wave. Asaccelerators grew in power and sophistication, and as collisions yielded evermore and more new types of debris, atomic physics entered a period ofphilosophical perturbation in the late 1960s, for by then it had become clearthat “protons and neutrons must harbor smaller-scale structures.” 62[text00015.html#fn62] Into this situation stepped physicist Murray Gell-Mann,who argued that hadrons, i.e., protons and neutrons, were each composed of three“quarks.” These “quarks” in turn came in three types, “up,” “down,” and“strange.” Additionally, Gell-Mann proposed that they had fractional charges.The “up” quark had a charge of 2/3, and the “down” and “strange” quarks each hada charge of -1/3. Since hadrons always come in groups of three quarks each, theproton had to have two up quarks and one down, giving a charge of 2/3+2/3-1/3 =1, and the neutron had to have one up quark and two down quarks, giving a chargeof 2/3 -1/3-1/3=0. 63 [text00015.html#fn63] All of this, physicists reasoned,was held together by “force mediating” particles within the nucleus thatfunctioned much like the quantized force mediating particle in electrodynamics,the photon. These force mediating particles are called “gluons.” Thus, when theCollider is colliding protons, what it is really colliding—according to thetheory—are the quarks and gluons that make up protons. 64 [text00015.html#fn64]b. The Proton Path and the Structure of the ColliderThe Collider itself consists of four basic systems each designed to integratewith each other, and each performing certain individual tasks. These are (1) theaccelerator system itself, with which we shall be momentarily concerned, (2) theproton beam confinement and focusing systems, i.e., the powerful magnets of theCollider, (3) the massive detectors to “photograph” the particle collisions, and(4) the huge data processing, filtration, storage, and dissemination system. 65[text00015.html#fn65]Since protons are the only particle in the nucleus of ordinary hydrogen, ahydrogen ion source is used to create the beam of protons. From this source theyare then passed to a linear accelerator (LINAC), where the beams is acceleratedto an energy of 50 Mega-electron volts (50 MeV). They are then passed to a“booster” accelerator known as a proton synchrotron booster (PSB) where itacquires energies of 1.4 giga-electron volts (GeV). From here the beam isdirected to the Proton Synchrotron were it is accelerated to 26 GeV. The beam isthen passed to the Super Proton Synchroton(SPS), with a ring of the diameter of2.25 kilometers, or about 7 kilometers circumference. From the SPS the beam isinjected via two channels down into the Collider itself, where it whirls aroundin opposite directions until colliding in the various detectors placed aroundits 27 kilometer circumference. 66 [text00015.html#fn66]It is important to note that all of these accelerators are located farunderground, with the Super Proton Synchrotron above the Collider’s ring, andcanted off center. Additionally, the Collider itself is not constructed on thehorizontal, but actually varies in depth between 45 and 170 meters, “and lies ina plane that is inclined at 1.4 degrees from the horizontal; and this was doneso that the tunnel would lie almost entirely in the Leman basin molasse.” 67[text00015.html#fn67] A “molasse” is a geological term denoting a sedimentarydeposit of shales and sandstones, which are often quartz bearing or feldsparbearing rocks.001 [Image00033.jpg]A Diagram of the Relationship of the Super Proton Synchrotron, the dark circle,above and off-center from the Large Hadron Collider, the larger circleunderneath. Also visible in the diagram are the LHCb, CMS, ATLAS, and ALICEdetectorsThe geological contexts, plus the actual physical disposition of the SuperProton Synchrotron above the Collider, and offset from in the vertical plane,will form components of our own very speculative analysis later. For the moment,they are simply pointed out.c. The DetectorsAll of this would be superfluous, however, if there was no means of detectingand recording what was happening in the beam collisions. This is the task of thefour detectors placed around the Collider itself. With these, one is againconfronted by an organizational structure that presents the possibilities forhidden interests, purposes, and coordination, for while the Collider itself isrun by CERN, the detectors fall under the purview of the Large Hadron ColliderExperiments Committee “whose job it is to give advice to the CERN management andthrough it to the Council.” 68 [text00015.html#fn68] However, unlike the rest ofthe organizational structure, the teams working with and on the detectors aregiven “considerable independence.” 69 [text00015.html#fn69]There are perfectly reasonable explanations for this. Since some of thedetection experiments have overlapping purposes, this independence guarantees ameasure of objectivity in the results being obtained. What might show up as thesignature of a particular particle debris in one detector might show up in anentirely different fashion in another, or be absent altogether. Keeping ameasure of independence between detectors thus gives the experiments acommensurate objectivity. Yet another reason for this independence is that thedetectors are also designed to look for different things, and have to coordinatewith their collaborating institutions “all around the globe.” 70[text00015.html#fn70]But by the same token, it is this independence of very tasks, teams, andcollaborating institutions that also opens up the possibility that covertprojects or agendas could be in play. As will be seen, this possibility isdramatically increased when one considers the data filtration and managementsystem for the project.The detectors themselves are each probably the most complex systems in the wholeCollider super-system. Indeed, their bewitching mandala-like complexity meansthat most of the photographs one sees in various books or articles about theCollider are not actually pictures of the Collider, but of its variousDetectors. With them, one also again encounters statements of purpose in clearcontradiction to CERN’s bland assurances that they are not looking for dangerousstrangelets. For example, the proposed ALICE detector, which was “a dedicatedheavy-ion experiment” designed “to search for and study the quark-gluon plasma”received approval in 1997. 71 [text00015.html#fn71] But there are alsosuggestive hints that scientists are looking for more than he dangerousstrangelets:There are hopes for discoveries that might reveal physics beyond the predictionsof the present theory; for instance we might observe signs of supersymmetry orextra dimensions, the latter potentially requiring the modification of gravityat the Tera-electron volt (TeV) scale. Overall, the TeV energy scale appears tohave special significance; each of the (Large Hadron Collider) experiments isdesigned to study physics at these energies. 72 [text00015.html#fn72]Reading between the lines, what is being suggested here is that there areindications of a “new physics,” one involving gravity, at these energy scales,and this suggests that there might have indeed been hidden motivations for, andpurposes behind, the construction of the collider.Two of the Collider’s detectors, ATLAS, standing for “A Toroidal Large hadroncollider Apparatus,” and CMS, standing for “Compact Muon Solenoid,” are “generalpurpose detectors” 73 [text00015.html#fn73] , while the LCHb, standing for“Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment,” and ALICE, standing for “A Large IonCollider Experiment,” are specialty detectors. 74 [text00015.html#fn74]Since these Detectors are in a sense very sophisticated “cameras,” they aredesigned with multiple layers of “film,” each layer designed “to perform aspecific task, and together they allow identification and precise measurement ofthe energies of all the particles produced in LHC proton-proton collisions.” 75[text00015.html#fn75] These layers, in the ATLAS and CMS detectors, are layeredin cylindrical fashion around the beam path where collisions are induced. In the“Compact Muon Solenoid” (CMS) detector, for example, debris particles createdfrom collisions will first pass through a system of finely granulated silicon(we will explain the reasons for this fine granulation in a moment), thenthrough an electromagnetic calorimeter, then a hadron calorimeter, then asuper-conducting solenoid, and finally through several layers of ironalternating with muon chambers. 76 [text00015.html#fn76]The fine granulation or pixilation of the silicon “film” (or of whatevermaterial is being used as the “film” in various detectors), must be fine andmultilayered to allow the tracking of the paths of the debris particlesthree-dimensionally through the grid of “pixels” or “grains.” The finer thegrain or “grid,” the more accurate the “photograph” of the path will be. Forexample, in the electromagnetic calorimeter layer of the CMS detector, the“film” consists of square-shaped rods of lead-tungstanate crystals, whoselattice structures respond to the smallest energy oscillations of any particlespassing through them. Assembled in a “grid” of such crystals allows the energydisplacements to be recorded, and hence the path of the particle to be tracked.77 [text00015.html#fn77] Thus, each of the Detectors are huge “100-mega-pixel3-D cameras.” 78 [text00015.html#fn78] Given the multiple layering and heavycomponents of the four detectors, they are extraordinarily heavy and expensive.The Compact Muon Solenoid Detector weighs in at 14,000 tons, and each of thefour detectors is capable of taking over 40 million of its three dimensional“particle path pictures” per second. 79 [text00015.html#fn79] Obviously, thismeans that the Collider’s Detectors are generating a massive amount of dataevery day, posing new challenges for its storage, selection, and dissemination,a point to which we shall eventually return.Given the enormous energies coursing through each detector as these millions ofparticles track through their layers having their “pictures” taken, allelectronics within them must be radiation hardened. 80 [text00015.html#fn80] Inaddition, the magnetic fields of each Detector are enormous(not to mention thoseof the Collider itself!). The Compact Muon Solenoid(CMS) has a magnetic fieldstrength of 4 Teslas, 81 [text00015.html#fn81] and the ALICE detector has asolenoid magnet “capable of generating a field strength of 0.7 (Teslas). Forcomparison, this is about 15,000 times the field strength of the Earth’smagnetic field.” 82 [text00015.html#fn82](1) The ATLAS and CMS DetectorsAs previously noted, the ATLAS(A Large Toroidal Lhc ApparatuS) and CMS (CompactMuon Solenoid) are general purpose detectors, with the ATLAS delivering anoverall field strength of 2 Teslas. 83 [text00015.html#fn83] By searching formeson decays of “bottom quarks” the ATLAS and CMS detectors will be tasked, inpart, to explore “the physics of matter and antimatter,” 84[text00015.html#fn84] and in addition “be able to distinguish between real extradimensions and their supersymmetric imitators.” 85 [text00015.html#fn85](2) The ALICE DetectorThe ALICE detector (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is one of two “specialty”detectors, designed to test the “behavior of the primordial plasma” by using“one of the most exciting new theoretical approaches” that are “borrowed fromstring theory, which relate the strongly-interacting plasma just above thetransition temperature to a weakly-interacting gravitational system in fivedimensions.” 86 [text00015.html#fn86] ALICE will do this by observing thecollisions of lead ions that are accelerated in the Collider. The energies ofthese collisions exceed those of protons by two orders of magnitude, and thusthe ions undergoing such collisions heat up “to a temperature 100,000 timeshigher than the temperature in the core of our sun.” As a result of this,“Nuclei and nucleon melt into their elementary constituents, quarks and gluons,to form for a brief instant the primordial matter that filled the universe untila few microseconds after the Big Bang.” 87 [text00015.html#fn87] This reactionzone will then expand at a velocity close to that of light, and in doing so,cool down and coalesce back into various “ordinary, composite matter particles.”88 [text00015.html#fn88] In doing so, the ALICE detector will be attempting akind of alchemy, to reconstruct on a very tiny scale, “the primordial matter ofthe universe,” 89 [text00015.html#fn89] a search that was first begun at theBrookhaven National Laboratory in the USA.The detector itself is yet another marvel of technology.ALICE is usually referred to as one of the small detectors, but the meaning of“small” is very relative in the context of (the) LHC: The detector stands 16meters tall, is 16-m wide, and 26-m long, and weighs in at approximately 10,000tons, It has been designed and built over almost two decades by a collaborationof over 1000 scientists and engineers from more than 100 Institutes in some 30different countries. The experiment consists of 17 different detection systems,each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints.…It consists of a central part, which measures hadrons, electrons, and photons,and a forward single-arm spectrometer that focuses on muon detection. Thecentral ‘barrel’ part covers the direction perpendicular to the beam from 45° to135° and is located inside a huge solenoid magnet, which was built in the 1980sfor the L3 experiment at CERN’s (Large Electron-Positron) accelerator. As a warmresistive magnet, the maximum field at the nominal power of 4 MW reaches 0.5(Teslas). The central barrel contains a set of tracking detectors, which recordthe momentum of the charged particles by measuring their curved path inside themagnetic field. These tracks are then identified according to mass and particletype by a set of particle identification detectors, followed by two types ofelectromagnetic calorimeters for photon and jet measurements. 90[text00015.html#fn90]Once again, The ALICE detector will produce millions of pictures per second fromthe vast numbers of collisions taking place within its powerful magnetic field.Like the other detectors, ALICE is actually a layered system of “films” of otherdetection systems. And curiously, ALICE contains two special detectors that arehighly suggestive that looking for primordial soup and extra dimensions are notthe only purposes for the machine. One of these detectors is the “TimeProjection Chamber,” or TPC whose purpose us to “disentangle the dense web ofparticle tracks in heavy ion reactions.” 91 [text00015.html#fn91]The other specialized detection unit within ALICE is the High Momentum ParticleIdentification Detector(HMPH). The description of this device is worth citing atlength:The evolution of another method, to which many groups have contributed over thepast 30 years, was pushed to new levels of performance: the Cherenkov detector.If, while traversing a medium (e.g., a gas or liquid), particles move at a speedthat exceed the speed of light, the particles excite the medium to emitCherenkov light, named after the discoverer of this phenomenon. This light isemitted at a certain characteristic angle, determined by the velocity of theparticle and the refractive index of the medium. By detecting the very faintlight and its direction, the velocity can be determined, which allows deducingthe mass, and hence the type, of the particle. 92 [text00015.html#fn92]Put differently, this is an admission of yet another purpose of the Collider,namely, that it is looking for faster-than-light velocity particles, ortachyons.001 [Image00034.gif]A Cutaway diagram of CERN’s ALICE (A Large Ion Collision Experiment) Detector.The two human figures to the lower left are to scale.(3) The LHCb Detector and ExperimentThe other specialized detector of the Collider is the LHCb, or “Large HadronCollider beauty experiment.” The stated purpose for this detector and itsexperiment is to resolve a fundamental question in physics, namely why thematter-antimatter relationship is asymmetrical, and why there is a preponderanceof matter over antimatter, a preponderance that “had already existed after thefirst milliseconds following the Big Bang.” 93 [text00015.html#fn93]One notes already some disturbing potential implications. Assume for the sake ofargument that the LHCb matter-antimatter asymmetry experiments were to revealwhy there is such a discrepancy. Once one understood this putative mechanism,one might also develop the potential technology to create much more antimatterthan the miniscule amounts currently produced in accelerators. That putativemechanism might also, by the nature of the case, reveal how more massive amountsof antimatter might be created in a stable condition, and stored over aprolonged time. Learning such things would be the first practical steps in thecreation of matter-antimatter reactors, providing enormous amounts of energy andreplacing, at a stroke, the current energy system. Such things would also be thefirst practical steps in the creation of “the ultimate explosive,” and hence,the ultimate bomb, with a planet- or star-busting potential far beyond our mostpowerful hydrogen bombs. 94 [text00015.html#fn94]In other words, one has here a powerful clue that there is possibly more goingon with the Collider than is grasped by the public, for the prior twopossibilities—a solution to the energy problem, and a hugely destructivemilitary weaponization potential—would justify the massive expenditure for theproject, and suggests the possibility of an entirely hidden and secret projectwithin the Collider, shrouded in the public one.Indeed, if as is often admitted that “the physics goal of the LHCb has shiftedfrom ‘testing of the Standard Model’ to the ‘search for physics beyond theStandard Model,’” 95 [text00015.html#fn95] then one has an admission that theCollider may be about much more than particle physics in any conventional sense.Here the reasoning behind this assertion is clear, and the LHCb Detector’sdesign follows inevitably from it:The letter “b” in LHCb is a reference to beauty quarks (and theiranti-particles), which are constituent (sic) of particles referred to as Bmesons. Already 20 years ago, it was apparent that the high energy proton-protoncollisions of the LHC would produce unprecedented amounts of B mesons, and thatshould allow us to look indirectly for “physics beyond the Standard Model”…The energies of the LHC collisions will produce a pair of b and anti-b quarksmostly emitted, mostly in a direction very close to the beam axis; thus, insteadof having a quasi-cylindrical geometry—such as ATLAS and CMS—which is optimizedfor particle detection perpendicular to the beam axis, the geometry of the LHCbresembles that of a reclined pyramid, which the apex located at the collisionpoint. The LHCb experiment’s 4,500-ton detector has been designed to efficientlydetect B mesons produced by those b and anti-b quarks and to study the productsof their decays. 96 [text00015.html#fn96]If one now gathers all the stated and admitted purposes of the Collider and itsDetectors, one has quite an intriguing list:1)Some of the experiments are designed to detect particles moving atfaster-than-light velocities;2)All of the experiments have in part the goal of discovering a “new physics”beyond the Standard Model;3)The Collider experiments are looking for confirmations of which model that“new physics” may take, including the following two options:a)supersymmetry; or (in our opinion the far more interesting)b)confirmations of extra- or hyper-dimensional types of spaces. But, as we havealready seen, conventional types of electrical networks are already, in Kron’sview, collections or networks of complex hyper-dimensional spaces, with eachsubsystem of a machine being its own subspace. Electrical machines, by thegeometric parameters of the circuit itself, are already hyper-dimensional spaceson Kron’s view, and so much more so would be the Large Hadron Collider. In otherwords, create a certain type of hyper-dimensional machine, and one will createcertain types of hyper-dimensional effects (particles). We shall return to aconsideration of this point shortly;4)The Collider is seeking to study(and thus, perhaps seeking to create) the“primordial alchemical soup” of the quark-gluon plasma or stranglets, and (as isthe case with our speculations on the matter-antimatter asymmetry) suchexperiments and study might lead to the discovery of a mechanism for its stableand “industrial scale” production; and finally,5)The Collider is seeking to elucidate the mechanism behind thematter-antimatter asymmetry; consequently the possibility arises that thismechanism could lead to the “industrial scale” production and containment ofantimatter, for energy and weaponization purposes.These types of considerations and speculations would seem to rationalize, in amore acceptable manner, the vast sums of money that have been lavished on theexperiment. It would seem at least possible that this expenditure is for morethan just collecting “particle butterflies” and pinning them to particletaxonomical charts and genealogies.5. The “Fifth Experiment”: Data Collection and “Filtration”It is, however, with the massive amounts of data that the Collider and its fourDetector experiments generate that one encounters the very real possibilitiesfor a hidden project or projects masked within the public ones. It is noaccident that with each experiment generating millions of pieces of data persecond per day, that the Collider’s database and management itself dwarfs allother database management problems, save perhaps those of the NSA’s worldwideelectronic spying program. It is no accident that many people view CERN’s datamanagement system for the Collider and its experiments as the fifth experiment97 [text00015.html#fn97] being run by the “cosmology cartel,” which, as we shallnow see, is also a cartel controlling the information and its interpretationthat the Collider generates.Each LHC experiment will produce about 10 petabytes of data per year (1PB—1,000,000 GB). This corresponds to about 20 million DVDs. The analysis ofthis data requires enormous computing power, equivalent to about 100,000 oftoday’s fastest PC processors. The collaborating institutions are spread allover the world and need access to data locally. In order to address these needsan enormous amount of effort had been put into developing the LHC ComputingGrid. The grid infrastructure ties together hundreds of thousands of processersall around the world. 98 [text00015.html#fn98]Such a vast international extension and collaboration represents the public faceof the Collider project, but it might likewise be the perfect way to“compartmentalize” a secret project within the public one, for such a projectwould depend entirely on having access to data not widely available to itspublic face. Indeed, it might even be possible that the disparate public facesof the experiment might be parts or components of some secret one beingcoordinated by some hidden body or group.The closer one looks at the Collider’s data management structure, the more thisbecomes a very distinct possibility. Once one understands that the Collidergenerates such enormous amounts of data—enough data to fill 100,000 CDs persecond 99 [text00015.html#fn99] — and that this data must be disseminatedquickly around the world, one understands not only why CERN and the Collider arethe internet’s biggest users, but why they to some extent drove the creation ofthe internet.Obviously, however, such massive amounts of data are simply beyond anysupercomputer or data storage system currently available, even the veryprimitive quantum computers already in existence. Thus, the data to be storedand analyzed has to be selected by a complex system of “filters” or computeralgorithms designed to look for certain types of events predicted by thetheories being tested 100 [text00015.html#fn100] . This process begins with anevent “trigger,” 101 [text00015.html#fn101] a pre-programmed set of parametersthat tells the detectors which of the many millions of events get permanentlysaved, and which do not. There is yet one final aspect of the system of datafiltration, collection, storage, and dissemination that has to be noted:The algorithms required for simulation and processing of the data are verycomplex; these were developed by specialists working in the different specialtyareas of the physics being studied, as well as by experts in the materials andtechnologies of the different subodetectors. But the factors that differentiateLHC computing from previous high-energy physics experiments, and from most otherscientific experiments are•the enormous number of physicists and engineers participating actively in dataanalysis—the CMS experiment alone has more than three thousand members —a largefraction of which are involved in algorithm and program development;•the widely distributed computer environment; about 100,000 processors installedin 140 computer centers in 35 countries are integrated into the LHC computinggrid;•the huge quantity of data that has to be distributed across the grid and sharedby all the members of each experiment. 102 [text00015.html#fn102]In other words, this data management system is not only a cartel but a trust,owning:1)the means of the generation of the data (i.e., the Collider and itsdetectors);2)the means of the analysis of the data(the computers and scientists); and,3)the means of programming the “filtration algorithms” which select and storethe data to be analyzed by the scientists.A philosophical question is immediately prompted by this system, for while it istrue that every scientist “selects” certain data, the signal, from the noise,the programming of such algorithms as “filters” in a certain sense brings homethe philosophical conundrum of quantum mechanics with a vengeance, for bylooking only for certain types of phenomena, only those types of phenomena willpotentially be found, thus confirming the theory; but also, begging thequestion! However, given that the Collider is looking for a “new physics” andother things beyond the “Standard Model,” this implies that those “dataselection filters” can be modified, or even that hidden filters designed to lookfor very different things might be in place.This raises the disturbing possibility that a hidden project could exist withinthe Collider, not amongst the scientists and engineers performing theexperiments but in the data being selected for analysis and interpretation.Notably, given the way the system is described, some of that data—datacontradictory to theory perhaps—might never reach the scientists. We must nowconsider how this might possibly work.D. Very Speculative Interpretations and Implications1. The Possibilities for a Hidden ProjectBy creating a system of data selection filters to select which data getsretained and stored for analysis in the computer grid network, some data gets“dumped,” not to be stored anywhere nor analyzed by anyone. It is precisely atthis point that the possibilities for a hidden project within the “cosmologycartel” arises:001 [Image00035.jpg]2. Philosophical Problems and SpeculationsIf one considers just the public face of this potential structure, a number ofphilosophical questions occur which, while not germane to our very speculativereconstructions which follow in the next section, nevertheless emerge from theprevious summary and speculations. Firstly, given that the results of theCollider experiments and its Detectors can only be replicated by the same kindof equipment, how does one independently verify the results of its experimentfrom an independent point of view, one not under the control of CERN’s“cosmology cartel”? Secondly, how would one “peer review” a paper whose authorsnumber in the thousands, and do so with people not connected to the CERNparticle physics community itself? These question highlight the disturbing factthat CERN and its Collider-Detector system is not only a “cosmology cartel,” buta “data source and interpretation cartel.”Perhaps such considerations were behind a recent announcement from China thatthat nation was considering building is own version of the Large HadronCollider, or perhaps it is concerned with some of the potential militaryapplications that have been suggested in the previous section that might belurking behind some of the stated goals of the Collider. 103[text00015.html#fn103]3. A “Kronian”Speculative HypothesisAll of this brings us at last to throw caution to the winds, and to outline ourextremely speculative hypothesis of what might be going on at the Collider ifone assumes that a secret project or projects might be cloaked within it, likethe Kammlerstab inside of the Skoda engineering division, though on a vastlylarger scale. As is by now evident, both the publicly-stated ostensible purposesof the Collider and its experiments, and the various conspiracy theoriesformulated around them, are both posited on the basis of the Standard Model ofquantum mechanics, and thus far, we have steered very closely to the publicstatements both of the conspiracy theorists, and to statements of the Collider’sscientific and engineering defenders on the basis of that theory.On Kron’s view, as we have seen, all electrical machines, especially networkedones, are collections of “interfaced hyper-dimensional spaces,” whose geometryis manipulated by the circuit parameters themselves. The Collider, being aquantum electrical machine utilizing superconductivity and enormous magneticfields, would seem to fill the requirements for one of Kron’s hyper-dimensionalmachines, and then some. In other words, if the scientists involved with theCollider are looking for evidence of hyper-dimensionality, they might look nofarther than their own machine, which might be producing particles as artifactsof the machine’s own parameters.Or, to throw the last smallest bit of remaining caution to the winds, perhapsthe Collider was designed to produce, rather than discover, some of the effectsit is looking for. Since in quantum mechanics the “Observer” predetermines theresults of experiments even before they have begun, the Observer thus entersinto the process of the experiment itself, and becomes, as it were, a co-creatorof the very effects he, she (or it), seeks to measure. On this view, thesophisticated Detectors of the Collider become, along with the computers withtheir data-selecting filters and the scientists interpreting the data, theObservers, and to that extent also the creators, of the effects being sought. Onthis view, the Collider is something few people appreciate: it is a complexsystem of Observers, and, as far as the human component is concerned, a groupobserver.We now throw a few more of the last remaining “quanta of caution” to the winds,and introduce another assumption and indulge in more “fairy tale science.” Ifthese assumptions of quantum mechanics are true, then how would one test anyeffects of a multitude of observers, a group observer, on observation? Onewould, first, get a tremendous number of people involved, and secondly, record amassive amount of data. One would, in effect, be conducting a series of physicsexperiments, and a series of social engineering experiments, at one and the sametime. On this view, the Large Hadron Collider is a complex open system comprisedof sub-systems, of which the participating scientists and engineers are acomponent part, perhaps unknown to themselves. On this view, the Colliderbecomes a gigantic “hyper-dimensional psychotronic machine,” with a public“physics component” and a hidden “social engineering-physics” component. Thepublic component can, moreover, be kept going more or less indefinitely, withthe scientists involved chasing ever more refined theories and particles in anever-more-expensive circle. Thus, the machine itself, along with its human“analysts” becomes an “Observer” in the proper quantum mechanical sense, only inthis case, the effects being observed—and the real purpose of the experiment onthe basis of this “Kronian” speculation—are of a cosmological and macroscopicorder to test the extent to which reality can be manipulated by theObservational “complex”—machine, detector, humans—itself.4. An Alternative AnalysisWe have proposed that the data management structure of the Collider opens up thedistinct possibility for a hidden system of data filtration and selection fromthe raw data that has been rejected from the public component of the project.Given the enormous amount of computer code necessary for these filters, it wouldnot be terribly difficult to secretly slip lines of code into the programs tocreate such hidden filters syphoning off data from the rejected stream, datathat might indicate anomalies or alternative types of physical theories nothaving anything to do with the Standard Model, super-symmetries, extradimensions, quark-gluon condensates, matter-antimatter asymmetry, and so on.Indeed, one possible hidden project might be the coordination of Collider datawith completely different types of data from other physical systems andphenomena. For example, the conceptual parallels between the Nazi Bell and theCollider have been noted: (1) counter rotation, (2) massive electrical fields,(3) cryogenic cooling and reliance upon superconductivity to achieve highenergy, and, (4) in the Collider’s case, the canted arrangement of the SuperProton Synchrotron and the Collider itself might induce “precessional wobbles”or a “torsion-twist” in their interacting magnetic fields and hence manifestthemselves as gravitational anomalies, or perhaps even earthquakes. Similarly,the massive size of the Detector’s magnetic fields, situated in a quartz-bearingmolasse of rock with its own inherent piezo-electric (and detection!) propertiesmight manifest as phenomena on the macro-rather than quantum, scales in theEarth or local space, such as earthquakes, increase of volcanism, anomalousweather patterns, and perhaps even changes in aggregate animal and humanbehavior.To detect such “open systems” interactions between the Collider and othersystems would itself require an enormous data collection system, one monitoringnot only Collider activities and experiments, but those of other systems, withcomplex algorithms to detect and analyze any apparent linkage between suchsystems and events within them.Whatever one might make of such extremely speculative hypotheses, however, thefact remains that that data management system for the Collider opens thepossibility to some secret project within it; the fact remains that the Collideritself is symbolic of the ancient alliance between physics and finance, and thatit duplicates not only the cartel and trust arrangements of “Rhenischcapitalism” and the wartime plans of the Nazis, but that it also duplicates manyfeatures of the Bank of International Settlements both in its international“sovereign” status and in its ability to obtain loans; the fact remains, also,that the defenders of the Collider have admitted that they are searching for thevery exotic forms of matter, the alchemical primordial soup, from which allexistence springs; the fact remains that the Collider is looking for solutionsto the matter-antimatter symmetry which, if found, could conceivably reveal howto create, and confine, large amounts of antimatter, both for energy sources anda source of powerful weapons of mass destruction..The fact remains, in other words, that the results of the experiments of theLarge Hadron Collider could have huge potential military implications andapplications.001 [Image00036.gif]CERN’s ATLAS Experiment Logo001 [Image00037.gif]CERN’s ALICE “Time Projector Chamber”001 [Image00038.gif]The LHCb Detector1 [text00015.html#fn_1] Joseph P.

Seealso http://www.fair-center.eu/ [http://www.fair-center.eu/] .29 [text00015.html#fn_29] The standard objection to such a hypothesis is clearand straightforward, for matter and anti-matter do not appear to exist inamounts symmetrical, or more or less equivalent, to each other in the observableuniverse. Matter and anti-matter annihilate each other instantly upon contactand produce pure energy, i.e., there are no “leftover” particles from suchinitial collisions. But since antimatter exists in such negligible quantitiesnaturally, and can only be produced by humans in negligible quantities, thestandard argument simply becomes one of pointing out that any such militarypurpose would be offset by the enormous production difficulties, not to mentionhow to store any antimatter that would be produced. Physical containment isobviously not an option, and thus, some form of magnetic containment would bethe only feasible option. This, however, becomes a remote possibility once oneunderstands the enormously powerful magnetic fields used in such Colliders.Steady production of antimatter over time within them, might produce enough forpowerful explosives, provided one could devise sufficiently powerful portable“magnetic bottles” to deliver it to a target. The Collider, in other words,becomes the Container, so long as the magnetic fields are maintained. Turn themoff while a large mass of antimatter was still under acceleration, and that masswould collide with the matter of the Collider, and produce an enormous releaseof energy. Such a possibility would be, so to speak, a kind of Dr. StrangeloveDoomsday device. Such possibilities were alluded to by Dr. Tom Van Flandern inhis book, Dark Matters, Missing Planets, and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved,Origins Illuminated (Berkeley, California: North Atlantic Books, 1993), pp.163-164.30 [text00015.html#fn_30] See my Babylon’s Banksters: The Alchemy of DeepPhysics, High Finance and Ancient Religion, pp. 159-205, 251-264.31 [text00015.html#fn_31] Ibid., pp. 130-153.32 [text00015.html#fn_32] For this interpretation of the long-term implicationsof the 1944 Hotel Maison Rouge meeting, see my The Nazi International, pp.69-83.33 [text00015.html#fn_33] See my Nazi International, pp. 249-346.34 [text00015.html#fn_34] Peter Levenda, The Hitler Legacy, pp. 171-172.35 [text00015.html#fn_35] For more details on the wartime (and postwar!) work ofthe Kammlerstab, see my Reich of the Black Sun: Nazi Secret Weapons and the ColdWar Allied Legend (Kempton, Illinois: Adventures Unlimited Press, 2004), pp.100-107; The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, pp. 141-191, Secrets of the UnifiedField: The Philadelphia Experiment, The Nazi Bell, and the Discarded Theory(Kempton, Illinois: Adventures Unlimited Press, 2008), pp. 227-288, 296-312, ThePhilosophers’ Stone: Alchemy and the Secret Research for Exotic Matter (PortTownsend, Washington: Feral House, 2009), pp. 205-302306-311, The NaziInternational: The Nazis’ Postwar Plan to Control Finance, Conflict, Physics,and Space, pp. 249-352, Roswell and the Reich: The Nazi Connection (Kempton,Illinois: Adventures Unlimited Press, 2010), pp. 363-436.36 [text00015.html#fn_36] See my Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 25-52.37 [text00015.html#fn_37] Joseph P.

It is also worth pointing out that according to somealleged documents of the infamous Cooper-Cantwheel documents of the alleged UFOstudy group and think-tank, Majic-12 or Majestic-12, President Nixon supposedly“privatized” or corporatized the study-group ca. 1969.

Tetens citing Assistant Secretary of State, Julius C. Holmes, April 7, 19451 [text00016.html#fn1]I NTRIGUING, IF NOT DIRE, PATTERNS EMERGE when one looks back on the previouschapters and views them synoptically. While it may seem redundant, there are somany details that form pieces of those patterns, that we shall repeat, verbatim,the conclusions of Part One, and then add to these the conclusions and patternsthat have emerged in Part Two.A. The Conclusions to Part One1)The Madrid Circular of 1950 was the alleged product of the German GeopoliticalCenter in Madrid, and thus allegedly of the postwar Nazi International. However,as was seen in chapter one, this author was unable to find any corroboration ofthe existence of this document beyond the books of T.H. Tetens. Thus, amethodology of corroboration had to be developed by seeking historicalantecedents within Imperial and Nazi Germany, and in postwar West German foreignpolicy. When viewed in this fashion, a number of the Circular’s policy positionsappear not only to have been adopted, but the Circular itself appears unusuallyprescient of developments occurring decades later. Among these developments, onemust take particular note of the following:a)The document advocates the creation of a European community, inclusive of acustoms union or common market, which federation would leave Germany, as thedominant economic power, in the position of the most influence. The purpose ofthe federation on the world stage is to create a “third way” between theopposing Communist and Atlantic blocs, with the federation serving to amplifyGerman geopolitical influence on the world stage;b)The Circular advocates the policy of promoting East-West bloc tensions even tothe point of a war between the USA and USSR, 2 [text00016.html#fn2] while theGerman-led Europe remained neutral in such confrontations, emerging as the clearleading power bloc after such a conflict. Certain key steps are involved inimplementing this strategy:i)The Rapallo Treaty of the 1920s between the Soviet Union and the WeimarRepublic is to be used to rearm West Germany and circumvent any treatyrestrictions imposed on it on the development of certain armaments capabilities,particularly atomic, biological, or chemical weapons of mass destruction. 3[text00016.html#fn3] As was seen in the previous pages, the Rapallo Prinzip wasfaithfully followed by the German Federal Republic as agreements for economiccooperation with “pariah nations” such as South Africa, Israel, and Iran wereused to disguise extensive military coordination and the technological transfersnecessary to acquire the complete nuclear fuel cycle, and nuclear andthermonuclear weapons, via proxy states. This extensive proliferation effortserves to create extraterritorial nuclear and thermonuclear capabilities in thehands of the large corporations and cartel arrangements making it possible, andalso creates a multi-layered redundancy in the proxy states utilizing Germannuclear technology, which includes continental Europe’s only declaredthermonuclear power, France.ii)The Circular explicitly states that “for us,” i.e., the Nazi International,“the war never stopped,” 4 [text00016.html#fn4] and draws clear support for thisin the lack of any formal representative of the Nazi Party at any of the formalsurrenders of 1945. The clear implication of this assertion is that the NaziInternational was alive and well in the heart of Germany and Europe itself, apoint corroborated in official British reports concerning the Naumann Coupattempt against Adenauer’s government, as will be seen below:iii)The long term goal was to isolate America via the short-term, andsuccessful, derailment of the Morgenthau Plan to de-industrialize Germany, 5[text00016.html#fn5] and then to manipulate the USA into increasing isolation ofits “dollar diplomacy” via engineered wars, economic crises, and destabilizationof the Middle East, 6 [text00016.html#fn6] while simultaneously the German-ledEuropean federation pivoted its economic trade to the East; 7[text00016.html#fn7]iv)Once this occurred, the USA would be forced to rely increasingly on more andmore force and a “unipolar attitude,” accurately anticipated by the Circular,and once this occurred, the terms of the Atlantic Alliance could be voided,since America will have become the aggressor nation, and the European nationswould be under no obligation to join its military ventures; 8[text00016.html#fn8]v)All of this would be accomplished via covert operations and an extensivenetwork of contacts in industry and government—including America 9[text00016.html#fn9] —a network which the Circular explicitly states may haveincluded personnel “executed for treason” in the July 1944 “bomb plot” againstAdolf Hitler, a breathtaking assertion either suggesting that the plot was adeliberate false flag event to deceive the Allies, protect high-ranking Nazis bymaking them “dead” to further Allied investigation (after all, one does notsearch for people one assumes are dead), or a crisis of opportunity exploited bythe Nazi hierarchy for the same purpose; 10 [text00016.html#fn10]2)The stated goal of the Madrid Circular of a German-led European federation wasin fact a consistent goal of members of the German military, political, andfinancial elite from General Bernhardi and Reichskanzler Theobald vonBettmann-Hollweg prior to and during World War One, to post-World World war TwoWest German Chancellors from Adenauer to Helmut Kohl, Gerhard Schröder andAngela Merkel. While we have yet to examine the Nazis and their own statementsand plans for European Union in any detail, which will be the main subject ofthe next part of this book, what is evident thus far is that the Madrid Circularaccurately reflects the consistency of this vision;a)We have noted, however, that certain Nazi documents beginning in 1943 andcontinuing right to the end of the war, including Generalplan 1945, advocatedsuch a German-led European federation. Additionally, we noted that theGeneralplan 1945 spelled this out in terms of political federation, economicunion, and as will be seen in the next part of this book, an amalgamation of lawand jurisprudence. This union is to eventually include European Russia in itsembrace. 11 [text00016.html#fn11]b)Those wartime Nazi documents also advocated a policy of psychological warfareagainst the Western powers, and we suggested in the previous pages that theNaumann Coup attempt against Adenauer’s government, the responsibility for whichthe British explicitly laid at the feet of the postwar Nazi International, wasone such operation, since the operation allowed the Adenauer government,notwithstanding its own Nazis and pro-Nazi sympathizers, to appear moderate.3)Finally, we observed the pattern of interlocking corporate and cartel drivenmilitary and political manipulation of Islam by means of radicalizing it, and inradicalizing it, weaponizing it for use in destabilizing the Middle East andupsetting British and American interests in the region. The result, again, hasbeen exactly that as predicted by the Madrid Circular, for as Washington mustincreasingly use a heavy hand in the region, it becomes increasingly isolated.In the case of the German nuclear “cartel,” we discovered that the Germannuclear industry, in its historical roots, is comprised largely of the componentcompanies of the IG Farben cartel, all working in concert, a point whichsuggests that while Farben may be officially dead in name, it is dead only inname. Given the consistent connection of German policy toward radical Islam, andits promotion of jihad since the days of the Kaiser and its consistent abilityto endure shifts of government in Iran from World War Two through the overthrowof both Mossadegh and the Shah, the known Nazi connections to other radicalIslamic groups, 12 [text00016.html#fn12] it was even suggested that the “war onterrorism” might be a convenient cover for a war on the Nazi International, awar which America and her allies would have great difficulty selling to theirpopulations.B. Conclusions to Part TwoTo these insights, conclusions, and patterns, the following details may now beadded:4)Definite parallels exist between the structure of the Exchange Rate Mechanismof the 1980s and 1990s, and today’s European Union, and the wartime plans of theNazis in the following respects:a)“Peter Oldfield’s,” a.k.a. Per Jacobssen’s novel The Alchemy Murder detailsthe interwar League of Nations recommendations for the construction of enormouschemicals cartels with sufficient power:(i) to oppose the warmaking powers of nation-states;(ii) to establish and maintain international economic order;(iii) to function as the mechanisms and agents of technology transfer viapatents and licensing agreements;(iv) As was seen, however, the only cartel of such international extent was I.G.Farben, which functioned as the principal component of the Nazi war machine;b)The Bank of International Settlements was conceived by German banker HjalmarSchacht as an independent “sovereign” entity ostensibly for the purpose tohandle war reparations payments, but functioned in practice, particularly duringthe war, as the international agent and clearing house for Nazi cartelinterests. There are definitive indicators that the BIS functioned, and maystill function, as the central and principal component of a hidden system offinance in the following ways:(i) Given its “sovereign” status, the BIS is allowed diplomatic pouchimmunities, and was and is thus in a position to launder bearer-securities ofall types, as well as currencies, a function which it performed during the war;(ii) The Nazis in the form of Karl Blessing, Kurt von Schröder, IG Farben COEHerman Schmitz and other Schacht-sponsored appointees to its Board of Governors,viewed the Bank and its utopian objectives—those having to do with the meme ofthe obsolescence of the nation-state—as being exploitable by the Nazi-Cartelregime, which had adopted similar language for its own purposes of Europeanpower politics;(iii) The continuity of the political and financial “European-Reich” outlook ofthe Nazi-Farben alliance is continued after the war by the prominent position ofNazi financiers in postwar German financial institutions, such as Blessing’spresence in the postwar West German Bundesbank;(iv) As such, the BIS was also viewed as a principal means for the postwarmitigation of Allied treatment of Germany and was a key component of Nazisurvival, and the Party’s strategic evacuation plans to move large amounts ofcapital out of Europe;(v) The BIS functioned as a principal means of the continuation of wartimecontact between the German financial-cartel elite on the one hand, withsympathetic American counterparts such as the Dulles-Bush-Harriman “axis” thatran through the Wall Street firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, via its wartimeAmerican president Thomas H. McKittrick; 13 [text00016.html#fn13](vi) Given its ability to move physical paper, in the form of agreements,securities, currency, and so on via diplomatic pouch, the speculative suggestionwas advanced that the move to digital cashless societies might be a move of thefinancial power elite to maintain “transparency” of public finances, whilemaintaining its own opacity to public scrutiny. This view was argued in thecontext that a hidden system of finance might, and very well would, be dependenton the movement of physical paper—in the form of bearer bonds and other bearerinstruments—through a system of “diplomatic pouch” immunity such as is possessedby the Bank of International Settlements. A hidden system based on such “bearerinstruments” and the movement of actual physical paper through such channelswould be totally opaque to any public oversight or individual national scrutiny.This would allow the creation of a truly international system of hidden finance,one that could very well be utilized for the funding of black projects on aninternational scale and order. In such a system, an institution like the BISwould be essential, for the BIS essentially functioned as a kind of Venetianbanco di scitta, but on an international scale. These facts and speculations mayexplain why the BIS survived and outlived its ostensible purpose of handlinginterwar reparations payments, and why it survives today, though theSchacht-Sukarno episode indicates that other banks are involved in this system;c)The joint plans of the Nazi Party-I.G. Farben “coalition” and “marriage”focused on a staged integration of a European Reich or federation around aGerman core and leadership. This staged development focused on two principalmeans, techniques, and areas:(i) A “European Reich” project would first require the harmonization of variousEuropean nations’ patent law, as outlined by Walter Hallstein in his infamous“Hegemony Speech,” and by Sölter’s 1942 study. The principal means by which thiscould be quickly and effectively accomplished was by bypassing national andprovincial legislatures and parliaments, by establishing European-wideregulatory bureau-cracies to oversee different areas of the “large space” (i.e.,European) economy and markets. This, as was seen, bears an uncanny resemblanceto the bureaucratic structure of the current European Union, which, as was seen,showed Walter Hallstein involved at every crucial step in its formation. CERN,it should be noted, was one such agency created, and was given, like the BIS, a“cartel” and “trust”-like structure, and a kind of limited sovereignty.(ii) Coincidental to this, a “Reichsmark” zone would be established based on theidea of “margin-pegs” of other currencies within the zone to the Reichsmark, aplan that, again, was fulfilled by the establishment and operation during the1980s and 1990s of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, wherein other Europeancurrencies, including eventually the French franc and Italian lire were peggedto the West German Deutschmark.5)The pattern of the close relationship between high finance and high technologyand physics, a pattern begun in ancient times, is continued in Europe’s CERN,which has, as noted, a limited kind of “sovereign status” in international law,making it a perfect candidate for conducting a twin-track system of experiments,a public one, and a secret or covert one, since there is no single nation stateoverseeing it. As a “European” institution, however, the influence of the largermember-nations within it is palpable, particularly that of Germany which, as wasalso seen, was CERN’s largest contributor. Given the fact that CERN admits thatits Large Hadron Collider is designed to create and detect the creation ofquark-gluon condensates, antimatter-matter asymmetry experiments, and so on, itmay also be viewed as continuing the wartime pattern of the Kammlerstab which,according to a British intelligence agent, worked in “monstrous areas of physicson a daily basis.” Additionally, other factors are indicative of the possibilityof hidden or covert projects within the LHC experimental management structure:a)CERN’s Large Hadron Collider represents a “cosmology cartel and trust,” sinceit has control over:(i) the machines of the accelerators and the Collider itself, thus making anytruly independent verification of its experiments impossible;(ii) the information generated from its experiments; and,(iii) the “filtration” or selection of data from those experiments to becommunicated to its member scientists for study and interpretation.b)The “data filtration algorithms” however, suggest the possibility that therejected raw data could be siphoned and filtered itself, and thus thepossibility arises that other experiments in the form of data correlationsbetween Collider activities and other systems such as weather, geological,social, or geophysical systems, might be coordinated secretly;c)Finally, in our extremely speculative scenario, we suggested the possibilitythat the Collider and its Detectors, along with the involved scientists, mightbe creating the effects they observe as artifacts of the machine itself, when itis understood from a “Kronian” point of view that all electrical machines arenetworks of hyper-dimensional spaces. In this respect, we also suggested theextremely speculative notion that one aspect of a covert or secret experimentthat might be being run is a socio-physical engineering experiment to tests theeffects(if any) and limits of group observers on physical experiments. If suchextreme speculations were true, it would indeed constitute another example of“working in monstrous areas of physics on a daily basis.”But now there is a crucial problem, one that few researchers—whether they arefocused on postwar Nazis, or whether they are focused on wartime and postwarCommunists —have noticed, for if there are “ ‘Nazis in the Bushes,” there arealso “Commies in the Rosy Fields” of Franklin Delano. Indeed, as was pointed outin chapter five, prominent Roosevelt advisors Harry Dexter White and HenryMorgenthau wanted to shut down the BIS entirely, for both men perceived itsutility and distinctive “pro-Nazi” stance under its ostensibly Americanpresident, Thomas McKittrick.The problem was, they, and in particular, Harry Dexter White, had their own“questionable activities and associations,” and they were about to be questionedby a junior Senator from Wisconsin, whose activities would explode intopolitics, rock two presidential administrations, and launch its own “ism.”1 [text00016.html#fn_1] T.H.

Field Marshal Rommel’s Afrikakorps was poised withinstriking distance of Alexandria, Cairo, and the Suez Canal, and if these fell,the entire British position in the Middle East, with its oil lifeline, would bein jeopardy.But in Russia, things were even worse, as Colonel-General Erich von Manstein’sEleventh Army pummeled the Soviet fortress city of Sevastopol into a moonscapeunder the war’s largest artillery bombardment, and Friedrich von Paulus’ SixthArmy and Colonel-General von Kleist’s First Panzerarmee had just encircled anddecimated the Russian Sixth and Fifty-Seventh Armies south of the easternUkrainian city of Kharkov. By the end of June, three Soviet armies had simplyceased to exist, and the Wehrmacht had begun its summer offensive, sending theRed Army reeling, as it raced into the Caucusus and toward the city ofStalingrad on the Volga River. The Caucusus oil fields simply could not fall,for if they did, Soviet Russia would be unable to prosecute the war, and worse,German armies might pour over the borders of Persia, and completely unhinge theAllied position in the Middle East. Russia had to hold, or the war would be lostbefore America could bring her vast resources to bear.Harry Hopkins, and his boss, President Franklin Roosevelt, were determined notto allow that to happen, and consequently they took a decision which was to haveenormous consequences not only for the prosecution of the war, but for thecondition of American security long after it was over. In March 1942, Rooseveltissued orders outlining the prioritization of munitions distribution, in whichthe Soviet Union was to be given priority not only over other Allies(principally Nationalist China and Great Britain), but also over its own armedforces. 2 [text00018.html#fn2]Such prioritization might have made sense during early 1942 and the “high tide”of the Axis powers, but to American military officers involved in the USLend-Lease assistance to the Soviet Union, there appeared to be no slackening ofaid, even when it was clear that the Soviet Union would eventually prevail overNazi Germany, and this raised questions.One of those officers was World War One veteran pilot George Racey Jordan, whore-enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force on the outbreak of World War Two,eventually being promoted to the rank of major. Jordan was in a unique positionto observe the Lend Lease treatment of the Soviet Union, for he was the basecommander in charge of Lend Lease operations in Great Falls, Montana, overseeingflights of cargo being flown from the USA, to Anchorage, Alaska, then over theBering Straits into Russian Siberia and on to Moscow and other points in theSoviet Union. Jordan was thus in regular contact with the Russian pilots makingthese flights, and was in a unique position to observe their contents.A. The Mystery of the Black SuitcasesJordan quickly became suspicious not only of the amount of material being flownto the Soviet Union, but of their contents. Heavy black leather suitcases werebeing flown out under the cover of diplomatic immunity, 3 [text00018.html#fn3]in addition to crates of materials, some of which, as we shall discover,contained very odd materials indeed.The problem was not only what Jordan was observing, but also who was behind it,for it also became clear that the materials being flown to Russia were not, byany stretch of the imagination, “ordinary,” nor were the people authorizing theshipments. Eventually, Major Jordan also noticed that the aerial pipeline to theSoviet Union was also being used to fly many Russians into the USA, Russians whowould report to their commander at the Great Falls base, remain a few days, thenleave and never be seen again. 4 [text00018.html#fn4]As any reasonable person would, Major Jordan became suspicious in short order,after the small initial number of suitcases grew to such enormous amounts ofblack patent leather suitcases that filled entire cargo aircraft, that theRussians’ story had to change from the suitcases being simply “personal luggage”to being covered by “diplomatic immunity.” 5 [text00018.html#fn5] Adding to hissuspicion was that fact that each black suitcase was “bound with whitewindow-sash cord and sealed with red wax,” 6 [text00018.html#fn6]On an occasion when the black suitcases and cargo were loaded into a cargoairplane waiting to begin the long flight to Russia, Jordan took the opportunityuse his rank to bluff his way past the Russian soldiers inside the planeguarding the suitcases. Calling an American soldier on guard duty to theaircraft, Jordan ordered him to let the Russian guards “have it” if theyattempted to interfere with his inspection of the suitcases. 7[text00018.html#fn7] Then, he decided to examine every third suitcase,eventually examining around eighteen. 8 [text00018.html#fn8] Finding some unusedlong envelops in the pockets of his uniform, Major Jordan jotted down notes ofthe contents of the suitcases, from which he later composed a memorandum. 9[text00018.html#fn9] What he found did its own small part to launch the postwarCongressional inquiries into the extent of Communist penetration of federalagencies.1. The Contents of the Cases in Jordan’s Initial ExaminationJordan’s suspicions were warranted, as the cases contained roadmaps, tables ofrailroad mileages, charts of the locations of American industrial plants, and soon. 10 [text00018.html#fn10]Judging by their contents, various suitcases could have been labeled under theheads of machine tools, oil refineries, blast furnaces, steel foundries, mining,coal, concrete, and the like. Other folders were stuffed with naval and shippingintelligence. There seemed to be hundreds of commercial catalogues andscientific magazines. 11 [text00018.html#fn11]This, however, was not all that caught Major Jordan’s attention.2. The Cropped Margins and a Significant NameMany of the documents inside the suitcases that Major Jordan examined clearlyoriginated within various departments and agencies of the Federal government,such as “the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and State.” 12[text00018.html#fn12] One feature, however, of these papers were that they hadall been…trimmed close to the text, which white margins removed. I decided that this wasdone either to save weight, or to remove “Secret,” “Confidential” or“Restricted” stamps that might have halted a shipment, or for both reasons. 13[text00018.html#fn13]Additionally, as Jordan recounts, there were also “five or six State Departmentfolders” to each of which was clipped a name tab with the phase “from X.” withthe surname of some State Department official. 14 [text00018.html#fn14]One of the tabs that Major Jordan copied read “From Hiss,” 15[text00018.html#fn15] a name that would become almost synonymous with thepostwar efforts to discover security risks within the Federal government. Jordannotes that he “had never heard of Alger Hiss, and made the entry because thefolder bearing his name happened to be second in the pile” and because thefolder “contained hundreds of Photostats of what seemed to be military reports.”16 [text00018.html#fn16]001 [Image00039.gif]Major George Racey Jordan, U.S. Army Air ForceB. The White House, The A-Bomb, and Famous NamesBut one suitcase in particular yielded a treasure trove of revealing andprofoundly disturbing information, and here, it is best to let Major Jordanrecount it in his own words:A suitcase opened midway in the search appeared to contain nothing butengineering and scientific treatises. They bristled with formulae, calculationsand professional jargon. I was about to close the case and pass on when my eyewas caught by a specimen of stationary such as I had never before seen.Its letterhead was a magic incantation: “The White House, Washington.” Asprospective owner of an 80-acre tract along the shore of Washington State, I wasimpressed by the lordly omission of the capitals, “D.C.” Under the flashlight Istudied this paper with attention. It was a brief note, of two sheets, in ascript which was not level but sloped upward to the right. The name to which itwas addressed, “Mikoyan,” was wholly new to me. (By questioning Colonel Kotikov17 [text00018.html#fn17] later I learned that A.I. Mikoyan at the moment wasRussia’s No. 3 man, after Premier Stalin and Foreign Commissar Molotov. He wasCommissar of Foreign Trade and Soviet boss of Lend-Lease.)A salutation, “My dear Mr. Minister,” led to a few sentences of stockcourtesies. One passage, of eleven words, in the top line of the second page,impressed me enough to merit a scribble on my envelope. That excerpt ran thus:“– had a hell of a time getting these away from Groves.”The last two words should not be taken as referring to Major General Leslie R.Groves himself. What they meant, probably, was “from the Groves organization.”The commander of the Manhattan Engineer District, later the Manhattan Project,was almost unique in the Washington hierarchy for his dislike and suspicion ofRussia.Before continuing, it is worth pausing to take stock of what Major Jordan hasnow stated, for the clear implication of his remarks are, first, that someonehigh up with the Roosevelt Administration, within the White House itself, wasinvolved in supplying information to the Soviet Union, and secondly, that thisinformation had something to do with the USA’s “Manhattan Project,” thesuper-secret project to produce an atomic bomb under the command of MajorGeneral Leslie Groves. Continuing:The first thing I had done, on finding the White House note, was to flip overthe page to look for a signature. I penciled it on my envelope as “H.H.” Thismay not have been an exact transcription. In any case, my intention is clear. Itwas to chronicle, on the spot, my identification of the author as Harry Hopkins.It was general usage at Great Falls and elsewhere to refer to him as “HarryHopkins,” without the middle initial. 18 [text00018.html#fn18]In other words, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s closest political advisor,confidant, and personal friend, Harry Hopkins, was directly involved in gettinginformation from the American atomic bomb project into the hands of the SovietUnion.001 [Image00040.gif]President Franklin Roosevelt and Harry HopkinsFinding the name of a prominent and close presidential advisor on materialshipments going to the Soviet Union, with an admission that the materials wereobtained from the Manhattan Project only with some difficulty, would pique theinterest of any military officer, and Jordan was no exception. Harry Hopkin’sletter was clipped to two other items:One was a thick map. When unfolded, it proved to be as wide as the span of myextended arms. In large letters it bore a legend which I recorded: “Oak Ridge,Manhattan Engineering District.”The other was a carbon copy of a report, two or three pages long, which wasdated Oak Ridge. If it had a signature, I did not set it down. At the top of thefirst page, impressed with a rubber stamp, or typed, was the legend: “HarryHopkins” followed by the title “Special Asst. Coordinator” or “Administrator.” Igathered that this particular copy had been earmarked for Mr. Hopkins. In thetext of the report was encountered a series of vocables so outlandish that Imade a memo to look up their meaning. Among them were “cyclotron,” “proton” and“deuteron.” There were curious phrases like “energy produced by fission” and“wall five feet thick, of lead and water, to control flying neutrons.” 19[text00018.html#fn19]While not directly stating it, Major Ramey is implying that not only had HarryHopkins personally written Soviet Minister Mikoyan about matters and materialspertaining to the Manhattan Project (on White House stationary, no less!), butthat he had provided a carbon copy of a doubtless Top Secret report concerningthe project, a report intended for Hopkins’ use only, since all such reportswould have been carefully numbered and circulated to known individuals.Jordan was alleging treason, treason at an extraordinarily high level.1. Hopkins to Jordan: The “Special Shipment”The reality of Hopkins’ involvement was brought home to Jordan in April 1943when Hopkins phoned the base in Great Falls and asked to be put in touch withMajor Jordan directly. Jordan recalled the conversation:“Now, Jordan,” he said, “there’s a certain shipment of chemicals going throughthat I want you to expedite. This is something very special.”“Shall I take it up,” I asked, “with the Commanding Colonel?”“I don’t want you to discuss this with anyone,” Mr. Hopkins ordered, “and it isnot to go on the records. Don’t make a big production of it, but just send itthrough quietly, in a hurry.”I asked how I was to identify the shipment when it arrived. He turned from thephone, and I could hear his voice: “How will Jordan know the shipment when itgets there?” He came back on the line and said “The Russian Colonel out therewill designate it for you. Now send this through as speedily as possible, and besure you leave it off the records!’ 20 [text00018.html#fn20]After the curious telephone conversation, Major Jordan asked his Russianopposite number and Lend-Lease liaison officer, Soviet Air Force ColonelKotikov, what it was all about.Kotikov produced a folder labeled “Bomb Powder,” withdrew a sheet, and “set afinger against one entry. For a second time my eyes encountered the word‘uranium.’ I repeat that in 1943 it meant as little to me as to most Americans,which was nothing.” 21 [text00018.html#fn21] While it might have meant nothingto Major Jordan, however, it clearly meant something to his opposite numberColonel Kotikov, and to Harry Hopkins. Notwithstanding the urgency, the shipmentwas delayed for five weeks, finally arriving in Great Falls by rail. 22[text00018.html#fn22]Careful searching of the railroad and airway freight bills confirmed that theshipment that had finally arrived in Great Falls, Montana, in June of 1943,amounted to 15 crates. 23 [text00018.html#fn23] By 1949, notes Major Jordan,records revealed “that during the war Federal agencies delivered to Russia atleast three consignments of uranium chemicals, totaling 1,465 pounds or nearlythree quarters of a ton,” 24 [text00018.html#fn24] which consignments included2.2 pounds of metalicized uranium, about half of America’s stocks at the time,and the form necessary for use in an atom bomb. 25 [text00018.html#fn25] Jordancomments on the significance as follows:On the presumption that 1,465 pounds of uranium salts were contributed to theSoviet Union, metallurgists estimate that they were reducible in theory to 875pounds of natural uranium, which in turn would yield 6.25 pounds of fissionableU-235. But 4.4 pounds of the latter, or nearly two pounds less, are capable ofproducing an atomic explosion. 26 [text00018.html#fn26]The U.S.A., in other words, through Hopkins’ careful brokering of uraniumshipments and other matters having to do with the atom bomb, had shipped enoughmetalicized uranium to constitute about half of a critical mass (based onJordan’s figures), and had supplied a sufficient amount of raw uranium salts tometalicize into the remainder.Keeping a careful covert diary of the US Lend-Lease shipments to Russia, Jordandiscovered that the USA had also shipped tons of graphite, cadmium and aluminumtubes, and no less than 437 tons of cobalt, 27 [text00018.html#fn27] all ofwhich were, of course, valuable components in atomic research and theconstruction of atomic reactors, which in turn were needed to produce the farmore efficient a-bomb fuel of plutonium. Worse yet, there were also shipments ofdeuterium oxide crystals, one of the principal moderators in reactors, and oneof the main fuels in hydrogen bombs. 28 [text00018.html#fn28]2. The “Reich of the Black Sun” ThesisIn my previous book Reich of the Black Sun: Nazi Secret Weapons and the Cold WarAllied Legend I pointed out that in December of 1944, the best estimates ofAmerican metallurgists involved in the Manhattan Project was that the USA wouldnot have enough metalicized uranium for a bomb until November of 1945, wellafter, of course, the use of a uranium bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Inthat book, I argued that part of the reason for this was the USA’s decision topursue both routes to an atomic bomb: a uranium bomb, and a plutonium bomb, thelatter granting more “bang for the buck,” but also requiring that some of theUSA’s stocks of uranium be syphoned off for conversion into the man-made elementof plutonium through neutron bombardment in reactors. 29 [text00018.html#fn29]But we now have yet another reason for the shortage: someone within variousagencies of the Federal government was coordinating shipments of bomb andreactor components to the Soviet Union. 30 [text00018.html#fn30]3. Major Jordan’s Unfruitful Attempt to Warn the U.S. Department of StateMajor Jordan kept a private diary of notes of all the types of shipments he wasobserving leaving the United States for the Soviet Union under the guise ofLend-Lease and the activities of Russians being flown in who simply disappearedinto the American woodwork, and attempted on two occasions to bring the StateDepartment into awareness of these activities. On one such occasion, in January1944, he met with one John Newbold Hazard, a State Department liaison officerfor Lend-Lease, in the old State Department office building (now the OldExecutive Offices building) next to the White House.Hazard’s response, however, was not quite what Major Jordan might have expected:From his private office, after I was announced, came a young assistant.“Major Jordan,” he began, “we know all about you, and why you are here. Youmight as well understand that officers who get too officious are likely to findthemselves on an island somewhere in the South Seas.”With natural anger, I retorted that I didn’t think the State Department had anyidea how flagrant abuses were at Great Falls. I said we had virtually nocensorship, or immigration or customs inspection. Crowds of Russians were comingin of whom we had no record. Photostats of military reports from Americanattaches in Moscow were being returned to the Kremlin. Planeloads of suitcases,filled with confidential data, were passing every three weeks withoutinspection, under the guise of “diplomatic immunity.”“But my dear Major,” I was admonished with a jaunty wave of the hand, “we knowall about that. The Russians can’t do anything, or send anything out of thiscountry, without our knowledge and consent. They have to apply to the StateDepartment for everything. I assure you the Department knows exactly what it isdoing. Good afternoon.” 31 [text00018.html#fn31]As will be discovered in the next chapter, the Department of State became afocus of postwar Congressional inquiries into security risks and leaks, andpeople within the Federal bureaucracies closed ranks quickly to impedeinvestigation. One reason, as Major Jordan discloses, might have been to protectthe secret, and reputations, of those involved in these activities.4. The Affair of the Engraving PlatesMuch to Jordan’s disconsolation, however, surreptitious shipments of atomicsecrets and materials to the Soviet Union were not the only types of shipmentsoccurring. Jordan also learned that the Lend-Lease shipments also included theengraving plates for the “occupation marks” that were to be printed in postwaroccupied Germany! 32 [text00018.html#fn32] Ultimately, Jordan learned, theapproval of the transfer for the plates came from yet another high-rankingRoosevelt Administration advisor, Harry Dexter White, of the US Treasury, andRoosevelt Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, themselves. 33[text00018.html#fn33] The reason for the Soviets’ interest in these plates wasclear, for the occupation marks were to be totally convertible, and thus, theSoviets could simply print any amount they wished, and convert them to Americandollars, which they did, to the tune of $250,000,000. 34 [text00018.html#fn34]C. Aftermath: Enter Richard NixonMajor Jordan’s allegations were roundly denounced by the American political leftduring the immediate postwar period, and, on the opposite end of the politicalspectrum, just as readily endorsed. One such endorsement came from former F.B.I.agent Donald T. Appell, special investigator for the postwar House Un-AmericanActivities Committee, scene of the famous postwar charges of Whittaker Chambersand Elizabeth Bentley that prominent State Department official Alger Hiss hadbeen a member of a Communist Party cell, and a spy, and then freshmanCongressman Richard Nixon’s involvement in the whole affair that wouldeventually see Hiss indicted and convicted for perjury. Appell testified beforethe committee concerning Jordan’s “diaries” and their allegations:Mr. Nixon: Your investigation shows first, then, that Major Jordan did, at leaston two occasions, make a report concerning the passage of materials throughGreat Falls?Mr. Appell: Yes.Mr. Nixon: As I recall, Mr. Chambers had to tell his story five times before anycognizance was taken of his charges. So apparently if Major Jordan had told hismore than twice he might have gotten the Government to do something about it.But be that as it may, as I see it at present the issues are five.First of all, the charge was made that if the shipments were going through,Major Jordan should have made a report. In this regard, he did make a report ofthe charges at least on two occasions. Is that correct?Mr. Appell: Yes.…Mr. Nixon: Another point that Major Jordan made was that certain documents weregoing through Great Falls under diplomatic immunity; that he broke into thecases, examined the documents, and that some of the material in there which heexamined consisted of plans, secret material, and so on, which it would beassumed normally would not be regarded to be under diplomatic immunity.I think it is quite clear from your testimony that that phase of Major Jordan’stestimony stands up; is that correct?Mr. Appell: Well, we do know, we are in contact with a witness, a formeremployee of the Russian Purchasing Commission, who helped pack one pouch ofso-called diplomatic mail that went through, and we know it contained materialhighly secretive on industrial and war developments…Mr. Nixon: Is it the intention of the staff, then, to present this witness(Victor A. Kravchenko) who may be able to substantiate, at least in part, MajorJordan’s testimony that secret material was going through?Mr. Appell: That is correct. 35 [text00018.html#fn35]Mr. Nixon: On the point of the so-called shipments of uranium…the shipments wentthrough. Is that correct?Mr. Appell: Two specific shipments of uranium oxide and uranium nitrate, andshipments of heavy water have been completely documented to include even thenumber of the plane that flew the uranium and heavy water out of Great Falls.Mr. Nixon: And the final point is the matter of Mr. Hopkins having attempted toexpedite the shipments. Major Jordan’s testimony on that was that his notes,written at the time, showed the initials “H.H.” on one of the consignments whichhe broke into. Your investigation has shown no correspondence of Mr. Hopkins inwhich he used the initials “H.H.” Is that correct?Mr. Appell: That which we reviewed.Mr. Nixon: I understand that. My point is that as far as the investigation youhave been able to make is concerned, you as yet have been unable to substantiateMajor Jordan’s story on that point; is that correct?Mr. Appell: Yes.Mr. Nixon: But you have substantiated it on the four other points I mentioned?Mr. Appell: Generally, yes.Mr. Nixon: That is all. 36 [text00018.html#fn36]The substantial portion of Major Jordan’s allegations had thus been vindicatedthrough the House Un-American Activities Committee’s own investigations, butthis raised disturbing questions in the light of Jordan’s attempts to bring theproblem to the attention of the State Department, that department’s own responseto him, and the context and controversy that was beginning to brew aroundpostwar Washington of deep and pervasive security risks and Communistinfiltration of the departments of government during the RooseveltAdministrations and the circumstances of wartime cooperation.

Morgenthau was, ofcourse, the author of the notorious plan to de-industrialize postwar Germany andsterilize a large amount of its population, the plan, in fact, referred to inthe Madrid Document examined in chapter one. This plan was, of course, scrappedby the Americans shortly after the war, but became for a brief few months theofficial Allied policy for postwar occupied Germany. The Nazis acquired a copyof this plan during the war, and Dr. Josef Goebbels’ Propaganda Ministry madeportions of it available to the German public, thus bolstering Nazi claims thatthe Allies literally intended to annihilate the German Reich and people, andstiffening German resistance in the final months of the war. The plan wasultimately overturned both in the light of postwar geopolitical realities, andthe pro-German American business-finance complex, represented by the Dullesbrothers, American High Commissioner and lawyer John J.

Stanton Evans 1 [text00019.html#fn1]O N MAY 7, 1957, ALMOST FOUR MONTHS AFTER THIS AUTHOR was born in Sioux Falls,South Dakota (a fact whose relevance will eventually become evident), a youngman attended the quiet burial service of another older man on a bluffoverlooking the Fox River in Appleton, Wisconsin. The event would be an everydayaffair, unnoticed and unremarked by anyone in any but the shortest obituaries,save for the fact of the prominence of the two men involved. Indeed, so secretwas the younger man’s precautions in attending the funeral, that it would notbecome public knowledge for some time to come, for indeed, the younger man,well-connected to wealth and power, and an up-and-coming man of power and risingstar of the American political left in his own right, had secretly flown toattend the quiet burial ceremony for the older man, a man who had, until justthree short years previously, been a man of power of the American politicalright. Moreover, the legends surrounding each man in death (for the younger manwho secretly attended the burial of the older one is now also dead) is also asymbolic challenge to the historical assumptions that a small handful ofgatekeepers and idea police have tried to inculcate in the popularconsciousness, for the younger man is viewed by many on both the political leftand right as something of a pure hero of the highest ethics and aspirations,while the older man whose burial he secretly attended is almost universallyexcoriated by both the political left and right as the blackest and mostunscrupulous dastard, a black angel of smearing and unsupported allegations andruined lives, all of which nefarious bag of dirty tricks he used unrestrainedlyin his amoral pursuit of power.The older man had been a Republican United States Senator, and the younger manwould in a little over three more short years become a Democrat United StatesAttorney General, and later, himself a United States Senator, for the youngerman was none other than Robert F. Kennedy, sometime assistant counsel to theolder man on one of his U.S. Senate committees, for the older man was none otherthan the notorious junior Senator from Wisconsin, Joseph R. McCarthy, of“McCarthyism” fame.Author M. Stanton Evans, who has written a recent and thoroughly detailedhistory of the whole McCarthy era, whom we shall follow closely here, had thisto say about the strangeness of this icon, and the difficulties it poses forhistoriography:This was one of the strangest alliances in political history, given the standardimage of John Kennedy and his brother Robert on the one hand, and that of JoeMcCarthy on the other. Few politicians had had a better historical press thanhave the Kennedy brothers, and nobody could possibly have had a worse such pressthan Joe McCarthy.Despite these discrepancies in reputation, the affinities between McCarthy andthe Kennedys were solid, hence an embarrassment to historians who venerate theKennedy name but become apoplectic at the mention of McCarthy. As a youngcongressman, indeed, Jack Kennedy had entered the hard-line anti-Communist listsbefore the 1950 arrival of McCarthy, denouncing Owen Lattimore, John K.Fairbank, the (Institute for Pacific Relations), and the Acheson policy in Chinain terms that McCarthy himself could not have faulted.John Kennedy’s younger brother Robert was if anything even more attuned toMcCarthy’s views—inviting the Senator to speak at the University of VirginianLaw School when Robert was a student there, working for McCarthy aftergraduation, and asking McCarthy to be the godfather of his firstborn child (theeventual Democratic lieutenant governor of Maryland, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend).So loyal was Bobby to McCarthy that, at a speech by famed CBS broadcaster EdwardR. Murrow, who had vehemently attacked McCarthy, the younger Kennedy brotherwalked out in protest.The mind boggles at what might have happened if young Robert Kennedy (thentwenty-seven) had become, as he and his father devoutly wished, the chiefcounsel to new committee chairman Joe McCarthy. Kennedy’s own political careerwould have been quite different also. And the historians who idolize the firstand condemn the second would have an even more awkward task before them insquaring this improbable circle. 2 [text00019.html#fn2]That the one should attend the burial of the other is an unlikely politicalicon, raising the unpleasant and obvious questions that few like to ask, andfewer still like to answer: how is it, if the junior Senator from Wisconsin didnothing but smear and ruin people’s lives in open session of Senate committeehearings, making baseless accusations about their Communist Party affiliationsor activities, without any substantiation whatsoever, that he was able to do sofor so long, causing endless grief to both a Democrat and a RepublicanPresidential administration? If there was nothing there, why all thehullaballoo? And why would a Kennedy be involved with it for so long?The strangeness of this bizarre political Kennedy-McCarthy relationship ismagnified to extremes when one considers the standard “historiography” of theperiod and the man, which, again, is aptly summarized by Stanton Evans. “In thestandard version of the story,” he writes,…McCarthy began his ill-omened anti-Red crusade with a serious of mendaciousspeeches in February 1950, then enlarged on these in Senate hearings conductedby Sen. Millard Tydings (D-Md.) that began the following month. The essence ofthe McCarthy charges was that the State Department (and other agencies of theU.S. government) had been infiltrated by Soviet agents, members of the CommunistParty and their fellow travelers, and that officials supposedly guarding againstthis danger had first let it happen then covered up the facts about it.In these early speeches, McCarthy recited what he said were lists of Communistsand security suspects—mostly anonymous, some identified by name—as examples ofthe infiltration problem. These statements triggered fierce disputes before theTydings panel, in the press, and in public forums throughout the country.McCarthy’s charges were denounced as outrageous lies by President Truman, otherprominent politicians, the State Department, media pundits, academics, civicleaders, and a vast array of critics.At the end of this initial go-round, we’re told, McCarthy’s charges proved to becompletely baseless. The relevant data as conveyed by Tydings and since reprisedby countless others showed not only that McCarthy charges of subversion werefalse but that he lied about everything else from start to finish. He didn’thave any “lists” of Communists or loyalty suspects, had constantly changed hisnumbers and other aspects of his story, didn’t have inside information sourcesas he claimed, and otherwise deceived the Senate and the country. The wholething was a “fraud and a hoax,” and the American people could rest assured thatcharges of massive Communist penetration of the State Department werefearmongering nonsense.In the conventional treatment, this opening McCarthy battle was the template forall that followed. Though discredited in this first encounter, he would simplyforge ahead by making other, even wilder charges, smearing other victims, andspreading still more havoc. The rampage would continue unabated until theArmy-McCarthy hearings of 1954 and censure proceedings in the Senate a fewmonths later, when he would be condemned in an official action of hiscolleagues. In these final struggles, McCarthy was at last brought low,destroyed by his own excesses. Such was the mad career of Joe McCarthy, such washis dismal end, and good riddance to him. 3 [text00019.html#fn3]But if all this standard version of events was true and well-known by 1954, thenit reflects rather poorly upon the reputations of John and Robert Kennedy, andparticularly the latter, as he secretly attended McCarthy’s funeral, in spite ofall the “evidence” of McCarthy’s insane, sociopathic, madcap career. And, asnoted, this version of events also poses an even thornier question: if it wasall baseless lies from start to finish, how did one junior Senator in the U.S.Senate, with virtually no national power base, manage to pull it off for solong? If there was nothing to it, and it was all a fraud and a hoax, again, whyall the hullaballoo?Upon close consideration of the “standard historiography” of the man and theperiod, yet another question emerges: if there was nothing to the man and hisclaims, why did his political opponents fare so badly? Evans draws attention tothis overlooked point by observing that many of the most famous names in thefollowing decade and a half of American politics began their careers in whatmight be called the “Crucible of the McCarthy era”: McCarthy enemies SenatorsTydings, Lucas, and Senate Democratic leader McFarland, were defeated byMcCarthy allies Everett Dirksen of Illinois, and John Butler of Tydings’Maryland, while a young Barry Goldwater replaced McFarland in Arizona, 4[text00019.html#fn4] and a young Jack Kennedy was elected in Massachusetts overRepublican Henry Cabot Lodge because McCarthy refused Republican Party requeststo campaign for Lodge, and against Kennedy. 5 [text00019.html#fn5]001 [Image00045.jpg]A U.S. News and World Report Photo of Robert F.

KennedyThe strangeness of this bizarre political picture of the two Kennedy brothersand Senator McCarthy is made even more so when one contemplates the ultimatefate of all three men, two of whom would fall to assassins’ bullets undercircumstances in each case strongly suggesting conspiracy, and the other avictim to a protracted campaign of political and personal vilification andassassination that persists to our own day, vilification which, when theglittering textbook generalities rehearsed by Stanton Evans in the previousquotation about “McCarthyism” are peeled away to reveal the details, alsosuggests an element of deliberate conspiracy and continuing political spin. Thequestion is, why?As if all this were not enough to convince even the most hardened believer inthe standard narrative, there are a few more details to consider.Senator Mundt was still a sitting U.S. Senator when this author—who remembersthe late Senator’s somewhat nasal voice and his appearance on the CBS game showWhat’s My Line? very well—was a boy. Indeed, Mundt, a man whose ability tomemorize facts rivaled McCarthy’s—was important to the McCarthy story, havingchaired the Army-McCarthy Senate sub-committee, and served on McCarthy’s SenateGovernment Operations Committee. But Mundt shares another odd distinction: hewas one of only twenty-two U.S. Senators who voted against the Senate censure ofMcCarthy. The only Democratic Senator, who did not vote for the measure wasoddly and conveniently absent when the vote was taken, was MassachusettsDemocrat John F. Kennedy. The reason? Then-Senator Kennedy was having backsurgery and was laid up in the hospital.001 [Image00047.jpg]Senator Karl Mundt, U.S. Senator from South Dakota, 1948-1973, left, and SenatorJoseph McCarthy, U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, right001 [Image00048.jpg]U.S. Senator Joseph Raymond McCarthy (R-Wisconsin), 1908-1957, U.S. JuniorSenator from Wisconsin, January 3,1947—May 2,1957The Kennedy relationship to the infamous junior Senator from Wisconsin did notsimply disappear quietly during the night. Robert Kennedy’s “walk out” on CBSbroadcaster Edward Murrow for his treatment of McCarthy was well-known. Notably,this incident occurred in 1955, after McCarthy’s fall from political grace andcensure by the Senate. Less well-known, but equally potentially damning, wasJohn Kennedy’s walk-out three years earlier, at a Harvard event where theSenator was attacked, an event that, along with his absence from the censurevote in 1954, caused J.F.K. to bob and weave a bit:JFK’s warmth for McCarthy was not as great as Bobby’s, but he still felt enoughof McCarthy to have performed a similar act three years earlier at the 100thAnniversary of the Harvard Spree Club dinner. Robert Armory, who had been at thedinner and who later worked in the Kennedy Administration recalled in an oralhistory at the JFK Library that when a speaker had likened McCarthy to theconvicted Soviet spy Alger Hiss, JFK rose to his feet and declared “How dare youcouple the name of a great American patriot with that of a traitor!” and walkedout. The incident has never been denied by anyone who was there, and is acceptedby JFK biographers Herbert Parmet, Thomas Reeves and Chris Matthews.…Two years later, when McCarthy’s support collapsed and the Senate took up aresolution of censure, JFK was absent from the debate, recuperating from backsurgery. He would be the only Democratic Senator not to publicly declare supportfor McCarthy’s censure, even though he could easily have declared his feelingsfor the public record. As it was, he had instructed Ted Sorenson to draft astatement of support for censure on very narrow grounds, in which, asSchlesinger and Reeves note, made no mention whatsoever of civil liberties, andhad more to do with McCarthy’s employment of Roy Cohn. In the undeliveredstatement, JFK was quick to distance himself from the resolution’s assertionthat McCarthy’s actions had harmed America’s image abroad, and also stressed thelong period of support he had given to McCarthy and his cause.“This issue involves neither the motives nor the sincerity of the Junior Senatorfrom Wisconsin. Many times I have voted with Senator McCarthy for the fullappropriation of funds for his committee, for his amendment to reduce ourassistance to nations trading with communists, and on other matters. I have notsought to end his investigations of communist subversion, nor is the pendingmeasure related to either the desirability or continuation of thoseinvestigations.”JFK could easily have delivered this statement from his hospital bed, but in theend, he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Ted Sorenson admitted in 1971 that hefelt that JFK deliberately ducked him on that matter. And JFK admitted it toanother friend, Charles Spalding just prior to his release. Here is Spalding’srecollection of what JFK said.“You know, when I get downstairs I know exactly what’s going to happen. Thosereporters are going to lean over my stretcher. There’s going to be aboutninety-five faces bent over me with great concern, and everyone of those guys isgoing to say, ‘Now Senator, what about McCarthy?’ Do you know what I’m going todo? I’m going to reach back for my back and I’m just going to yell ‘Oow’ andthen I’m going to pull the sheet over my head and hope we can get out of there.”Not until 1956, would JFK issue a public statement supporting McCarthy’scensure, and even then it was only because his political future dictated it.“Even my Dad is against McCarthy now,” he remarked in private, “And if he is,then McCarthy has nobody left.”JFK’s after-the-fact conversion to anti-McCarthyism did not impress the partyliberals. Eleanor Roosevelt, the beloved symbol of the liberals openly beratedJFK in 1956 at the Democratic Convention for not having taken a stand againstMcCarthy, and repeated her mistrust of JFK in an interview for Look magazine in1958. The lingering image of JFK and the McCarthy connections was another reasonwhy JFK was challenged from the left in 1960.JFK may have regretted the McCarthy connection in later years, but the assertionof the JFK-As-Progressive advocates that he was never close to, nor sympatheticto McCarthy during the critical years prior to 1954 is totally contradicted byJFK’s own words and deeds. As with the friendship with Nixon, the confirmationcomes not from conservatives spreading rumors, but from JFK’s own friends. 6[text00019.html#fn6]The questions raised by all of this bear repeating: if the “standard view” ofthe Senator and his activities is true, why did McCarthy persist for so long?And why were the Kennedys not only involved but, in Robert’s case, in the middleof it?The answer, shocking though it may be, is that the standard view itself is apiece of carefully crafted and preserved McCarthyism of its own, one carefullymaintained by those in positions of power ever since, having little to do withwhat actually occurred, and why it occurred, rather like the Warren Report isstill maintained by the American Executive branch of government as what reallyoccurred in the J.F.K. assassination. But that in turn, raises anotherdisturbing question: what has any of this to do with the postwar Fascistinternational and its cartel-like activities? As we shall discover, the infamousSenator from Wisconsin may have come too close to certain truths that neitherhe, nor his investigators, nor his sources even imagined might have existed.Here, as always, the devilish potential for speculation is in the details.A. Wheeling, West Virginia: The Beginning1. The Numbers WrangleHad Senator McCarthy never boarded the airplane that would take him on a tour ofspeech-making and stumping for the Republican Party in February 1950, thehistory of the early 1950s, and of American politics since, might have beenvastly different. The tour would take McCarthy from Wheeling, West Virginia, toColorado, and to Reno, Nevada, before returning him to Washington, D.C. Evenafter he landed in the national capital after his tour, there were no throngs ofnewspaper, radio, or television reporters to greet him. It would take a few daysfor what he had said to ripple through the country, but by the time it had,there was already controversy about what he actually had said on his first stop,in a speech given on Thursday, February 9, 1950, in Wheeling, West Virginia.McCarthy consistently maintained he had said one thing, and his detractorsconsistently maintained that he had said another. What his detractorsconsistently said has entered the standard narrative, but the record suggeststhat it was, in fact, McCarthy’s version of events that was the reality. Butwhatever the reality, all students of the period agree that it was the Wheelingspeech that “launched the whole McCarthy era,” 7 [text00019.html#fn7] and thattransformed a relatively obscure junior Senator from the American Midwest into anational political figure.The setting could not have been more typical for this type of party stumpspeech, for McCarthy was to address the Ohio County, West Virginia Women’sRepublican Club on Lincoln Day, at the McClure Hotel in Wheeling. Perhaps, quipsStanton Evans, they were expecting a speech on farm subsidy policies or housingproblems—two areas of expertise for the visiting Senator—or perhaps even thepredictable standard fare on “honest Abe” Lincoln and the founding of theRepublican Party. 8 [text00019.html#fn8]What they received, however, was something quite different, and with it, thesaga began. In his speech, McCarthy informed his audience of almost 300 people“that there was a serious problem of Communist infiltration at the StateDepartment, that this had been improperly dealt with, and that strong measureswould be needed to correct it.” 9 [text00019.html#fn9] It is important to notethat McCarthy made no claim to having investigated these cases himself; rather,the whole point of his speech was that there were known security risks, and thatthese had not been adequately addressed.The speech, while it certainly made his audience sit up and take notice, did notimmediately attract any major national media attention, being covered only bythe local radio station, with an article appearing the very next day in thelocal newspaper, the Wheeling Intelligencer, by reporter Frank Desmond. 10[text00019.html#fn10] In his article, Desmond quoted McCarthy as having claimedthat he had a list of 205 persons within the State Department, known to theSecretary of State, who were members of the Communist Party, and who were stillemployed in the Department. The Senator, however, “would always categoricallydeny that he had said this,” 11 [text00019.html#fn11] and maintain that he hadstated that he had a list of people who were either “card-carrying members” ofor loyal to the Communist Party. 12 [text00019.html#fn12]Thus began the “numbers wrangle” between McCarthy, his supporters, and hisopponents, a dispute which continues to this day, and while the numbers issuedid not really address the substance of his allegations (that there were knownsecurity risks within the State Department that were still employed there), thenumbers issue did affect his credibility and veracity, “and, it’s worth noting,that of his critics.” 13 [text00019.html#fn13] By the time McCarthy had reachedthe last stop on his stump in Reno, Nevada, however, the Department of State hadresponded by issuing press releases, and what the Senator had actually statedwas beginning to gain national attention, albeit slowly. 14[text00019.html#fn14]Subsequently the State Department, and McCarthy Senate opponents William Benton(D-Connecticut) and Millard Tydings (D-Maryland), who would chair the TydingsCommittee and its attempt to derail the Wisconsin upstart, produced five itemsin proof that McCarthy had lied about the numbers he cited in his speech. Thefirst item was, of course, Frank Desmond’s article in the Wheeling, WestVirginia Intelligencer which indeed cited the 205 number. The second item was atestimonial letter from Colonel Austin Wood, one of the newspaper’s executives,“more or less vouching for the Desmond story.” 15 [text00019.html#fn15] Thethird, fourth, and fifth items were depositions from two members of the localWheeling radio station—Paul Myers and James Whitaker—who maintained that theyhad compared the rough draft of McCarthy’s speech against the speech that he hadactually given, and that the speech did in fact give the number 205, for thefinal item indicting McCarthy was the rough draft of the speech itself, whichdid indeed give the number as 205, a significant point, since Myers and Whitakermaintained that McCarthy had read his speech verbatim from the text. 16[text00019.html#fn16]At the heart of the charge of McCarthy’s lying, therefore, is his own roughdraft of the speech, an important point as we shall discover in a moment. It wasthis clear occurrence of the number 205 in the rough draft of McCarthy’s speech,plus McCarthy’s own insistence that he never said that number, but rather usedthe number 57, that caused Senator William Benton to immediately introducecharges in the Senate for McCarthy’s expulsion from that body(!), charging thathe had lied and perjured himself and had changed his story after he fact. 17[text00019.html#fn17] The charges were brought before the committee chaired byGuy Gillette (D-Iowa) which promptly sent investigators to Wheeling to determinethe truth of the matter. 18 [text00019.html#fn18]In the retrospective of contemporary politics, it seems astonishing that a merenumerical discrepancy should cause an immediate movement to expel a member fromthe U.S. Senate. After all, McCarthy had hardly disposed of over 30,000 emails,nor was he claiming that the eighteen-and-a-half minute gap in secret OvalOffice tape recordings were due to a simple secretarial mistake with aDictaphone foot-pedal. So why the sudden vitriol to have him removed from theSenate? Such actions are more evocative of desperation from people withsomething to hide. But if so, what was it?Burrowing into the details a bit more, the Gillette committee’s investigatorsuncovered “a number of intriguing things” about McCarthy’s rough draft, theDesmond newspaper article and “the Myers-Whitaker affidavits.” 19[text00019.html#fn19] For one thing, Desmond informed the committee’sinvestigators that the number 205 was taken from McCarthy’s rough draft, and notfrom what McCarthy actually stated when he delivered the speech at the McClureHotel. He had acquired the rough draft of the speech from the local radiostation, which apparently had acquired it from McCarthy himself. Worse yet (atleast for Benton, Tydings, and Co.), Myers and Whitaker told the Gillettecommittee that McCarthy had read only portions of his speech, but ad-libbed manyothers, freely walking around the podium.Worse still, the rough draft contained a number of egregious numerical errors ofanother nature altogether, namely, listing the population of the Soviet Union as“eighty billion” and the population of the free world as only “500 thousand.” 20[text00019.html#fn20] Since the affidavits clearly stated McCarthy had read hisentire speech verbatim, this posed a significant problem, for no one couldremember McCarthy “saying anything that outlandish,” 21 [text00019.html#fn21]and this poses yet another question, overlooked even by Evans: Why wouldMcCarthy have composed such a speech citing such numbers? He was, after all, nofool, a graduate of Marquette University Law School, reputed to have anearly-photographic memory, 22 [text00019.html#fn22] and who had even oncelearned enough Russian to ask questions of a Russian witness during one of hiscommittee hearings. 23 [text00019.html#fn23] How then did such absurd numbersfind their way into his speech? Whatever the answer to this question, theirpresence in the rough draft belies the assertions that McCarthy read his speechverbatim.2. Disconcerting EyewitnessesThe Gillette committee investigators, in reconstructing the history of the roughdraft, discovered that McCarthy informed the editor of the WheelingIntelligencer, Herman Gieske, that the rough draft copy that he had supplied toreporter Desmond upon his arrival at the airport was not the speech he actuallygave. 24 [text00019.html#fn24] Eyewitness William Callahan told the committeeinvestigators that the Senator had used two numbers, the larger number of 205,and that it was also his distinct impression that the smaller figure of 57 wasalso used. Eva Ingersoll, who was likewise in the audience that day, statedexplicitly that 205 people were being investigated, and that of this number, 57were members of the Communist Party. Asked how she could be so certain of thesenumbers, Mrs. Ingersoll stated that she had been so astonished when McCarthy hadstated it, that she wrote both numbers down on her phone bill. 25[text00019.html#fn25]Yet another serious problem surfaced for the Benton effort to have McCarthyremoved from the Senate, this from Herman Gieske, the editor of theIntelligencer, who composed an editorial which appeared in the paper on SaturdayFebruary 11, 1950, the day after the Desmond article had appeared in the paper.In it, Gieske stated the following about the speech:Senator McCarthy shocked his audience when he charged there are over fiftypersons of known Communistic affiliations still sheltered in the U.S. Departmentof State. When such an allegation is linked with the brazen avowal by SecretaryAcheson of his friendship for Alger Hiss, convicted of traitorous revelation ofU.S. secrets to a Communist espionage apparatus, the situation becomes one ofthe most vital concerns to every American citizen. Mr. McCarthy was frank andblunt in his avowal of an intense desire to see the supercilious, incompetentAcheson removed from office as a result of a coalition of Republicans andDemocrats on a patriotic basis. 26 [text00019.html#fn26]The paper had also run an article the morning after McCarthy’s speech, onFebruary 10, which did not contain the number 205, the clear implication beingthat McCarthy had never claimed there were 205 Communists in the government. 27[text00019.html#fn27] The Denver Post repeated the 57 number in its February 11,1950 article covering McCarthy’s visit. 28 [text00019.html#fn28] McCarthyhimself repeated the 57 number during his speech in Reno, and explicitly statedin a telegram to President Truman that “I have in my possession the names of 57Communists who are in the State Department at present.” 29 [text00019.html#fn29]The charge brought by Senator Benton that McCarthy had lied about his figuresand should be expelled from the Senate was not looking too good. Nonetheless,the number of 205 entered the final report of the Tydings committee, and fromthere, “it would be repeated, and still is, in countless books, surveys of theCold War era, and media productions of all types that Joe McCarthy was a liar.The stark contrast between such standard treatments and what is actually in therecord would become a model for virtually all discussions of McCarthy nowavailable to readers.” 30 [text00019.html#fn30]The other component of the building mythology was that McCarthy needlesslysmeared individuals by name in open committee session or on the floor of theSenate, hiding behind his senatorial immunity to do so. In order to understandhow that began, one has to look at what happened when McCarthy returned toWashington, when he gave a detailed speech on the Senate floor, fleshing out hisallegations, and at the Tydings committee that was ostensibly established todeal with them.Before we do that, however, a word about methodology is now necessary.Obviously, in a book such as this, one cannot hope to go into all the detailsabout the McCarthy era, nor about his defenders nor detractors (and both campssurvive to this day). Our method, rather, is to review and summarize the verybeginnings of that era, in order to place certain remarks from the Senator’s ownspeeches and certain odd and peculiar facts into a greater context. Once thatcontext is seen, the problematic breaks open with all its huge implications,implications that invite speculation, and which tie into the themes of the twoprevious sections of this book.3. The Post-Wheeling Senate Speech: February 20, 1950Senator McCarthy returned to Washington on Saturday February 18, 1950, to a“tame reception.” 31 [text00019.html#fn31] The following Monday, however,McCarthy rose on the Senate floor to read a lengthy speech into the record. Inthis speech, again, McCarthy clearly stated “I have in my hand 57 cases ofindividuals who would appear to be either card carrying Communists or certainlyloyal to the Communist Party, but who nevertheless are still helping to shapeour foreign policy.” 32 [text00019.html#fn32] With this speech, the dancebetween McCarthy, his supporters, and, as we shall see, his sources—whoever andwhatever they may have been—and his enemies began, and with this speech and thetactics of his opponents, the historiographic memes were set for decades tocome.a. Naming NamesOne of those memes is that McCarthy needlessly and recklessly attacked people byname on the Senate floor, hiding behind senatorial immunity. But a glance atthis speech is quite revealing, for over and over, senators interrupt him in hisreading of the cases he had, demanding that he name the names. Reading theseexchanges is illuminating. McCarthy began by reading into the record thetelegram he had sent to President Truman after his Wheeling speech:In the Lincoln Day speech at Wheeling Thursday night I stated that the StateDepartment harbors a nest of Communists and Communist sympathizers who arehelping to shape our foreign policy. I further stated that I have I in mypossession the names of 57 Communists who are in the State Department atpresent. A State Department spokesman promptly denied this, claiming there isnot a single Communist in the Department. You can convince yourself of thefalsity of the State Department claim very easily. You will recall that youpersonally appointed a board to screen State Department employees for thepurpose of weeding out fellow travelers—men whom the board considered dangerousto the security of this Nation. Your board did a painstaking job, and namedhundreds which had been listed as dangerous to the security of the Nation,because of communistic connections.While the records are not available to me, I know absolutely of one group ofapproximately 300 certified to the Secretary for discharge because of communism.He actually only discharged approximately 80. I understand that this was doneafter lengthy consultation with the now-convicted traitor, Alger Hiss. I wouldsuggest, therefore, Mr. President, that you simply pick up your phone and askMr. Acheson how many of those whom your board had labeled as dangerousCommunists he failed to discharge. The day the House Un-American ActivitiesCommittee exposed Alger Hiss as an important link in an international Communistspy ring you signed an order forbidding the State Department’s giving anyinformation in regard to this disloyalty or the communistic connections ofanyone in that Department to the Congress.Despite this State Department blackout, we have been able to compile a list of57 Communists in the State Department. This list is available to you but you canget a much longer list by ordering Secretary Acheson to give you a list of thosewhom your own board listed as being disloyal and who are still working in theState Department. I believe the following is the minimum which can be expectedof you in this case.1. That you demand that Acheson give you and the proper congressional committeethe name and a complete report on all of those who were placed in the Departmentby Alger Hiss, and all of those still working in the State department who werelisted by your board as bad security risks because of their communisticconnections.2. That you promptly revoke the order in which you provided under nocircumstances could a congressional committee obtain any information or help inexposing Communists.Failure on your part will label the Democratic Party of being the bedfellow ofinternational communism. Certainly this label is not deserved by the hundreds ofthousands of loyal American Democrats throughout the Nation, and by the sizablenumber of able loyal Democrats in both the Senate and the House. 33[text00019.html#fn33]This telegraph outlines what McCarthy’s major concerns were:1)There were people within the State Department who were known security risks;2)These risks had been uncovered by Truman’s own loyalty review board;3)Nonetheless some of these people remained in the State Department, contrary toits claims, and were thus in a position to influence foreign policy(an importantpoint as will be seen); and,4)President Truman had instituted a “gag order” disallowing any State Departmentor other Federal agency cooperation with Congress, in the wake of the Alger Hissaffair. 34 [text00019.html#fn34]Shortly after reading this telegram into the record, the challenges began, whenthen Senate Majority leader Scott W. Lucas (D-Illinois, 1892-1968) askedMcCarthy to yield:Mr. LUCAS.…What I am asking the Senator to do—and I hope he will do it, and thecountry wants him to do it—is to follow through with the speech which he made inWheeling W. Va., in which he stated more than 200 persons working in the StateDepartment were known to the Secretary of State to be members of the CommunistParty. If the Senator made that statement—and that is what has been reported—Iwant him to name those Communists…. The Senator is privileged to name them allin the Senate, and if those people are not Communists he will be protected. Thatis all I want the Senator to do. If the Senator names those 205 card-carryingCommunists, and he proves to be right, the Senator from Illinois will apologizefor anything he has said about the Senator from Wisconsin.Mr. McCARTHY. I wish to thank the distinguished Senator from Illinois for hisview, but I should like to assure him that I will not say anything on the Senatefloor which I will not say off the floor. On the day when I take advantage ofthe security we have on the Senate floor, on that day I will resign from theSenate. Anything I say on the floor of the Senate at any time will be repeatedoff the floor. 35 [text00019.html#fn35]In other words, McCarthy refused to name names on the floor. His reasons fordoing so would emerge during the course of the speech.001 [Image00049.gif]Senator Scott W. Lucas, D-Illinois, Senate Majority Leader, 1948-1950McCarthy then moved quickly to explain where the numbers 205, over 200, and soon, which he had used as well in his speeches on his stump speech tour (though,as we have seen not in connection to the “card-carrying Communists” issue), hadcome from:Mr. McCARTHY.…The Senator (Lucas) called my attention to something, and I amglad he did, otherwise I might have overlooked it. Incidentally, the speech inReno, Nev., and that in Wheeling, W. Va., were recorded, so there is no questionabout what I said. I do not believe I mentioned the figure 205, I believe I said“over 200.” The President said, “It is just a lie. There is nothing to it.”I have before me a letter which was reproduced in the C ONGRESSIONAL R ECORD onAugust 1, 1946, at page A4892. It is a letter from James F. Byrnes, formerSecretary of State. It deals with the screening of the first group, of about3,000. There were a great number of subsequent screenings. This was thebeginning.After another attempt by Senator Lucas to get McCarthy to yield, an attemptwhich McCarthy declined, he continued:(Mr. McCARTHY.) The letter deals with the first group of 3,000 which wasscreened. The President—and I think wisely so—set up a board to screen theemployees who were coming to the State Department from the various war agenciesof the War Department. There were thousands of unusual characters in some ofthose war agencies. Former Secretary Byrnes in his letter, which is reproducedin the C ONGRESSIONAL R ECORD , says this:“Pursuant to Executive order, approximately 4,000 employee have been transferredto the Department of State from various war agencies such as the OSS, FEA, OWI,OIAA, and so forth. Of these 4,000 employees, the case histories ofapproximately 3,000 have been subjected to a preliminary examination, as aresult of which a recommendation against permanent employment has been made in285 cases by the screening committee to which you refer in your letter.”In other words, former Secretary Byrnes said that 285 of those men are unsaferisks. He goes on to say that of this number only 79 have been removed. Of the59 I mentioned some are form this group of 205, and some are from subsequentgroups which have been screened but not discharged.I might say in that connection that the investigative agency of the StateDepartment has done an excellent job. The files show that they went into greatdetail in labeling Communists as such. The only trouble is that after theinvestigative agency had properly labeled these men as Communists the StateDepartment refused to discharge them. I shall give detailed cases. 36[text00019.html#fn36]Note that the clear implication of McCarthy’s claims is that he has some sourcewithin the Department of State who was supplying him information from its owninternal security investigation, and that among this information, there wereknown risks still employed.This implication of some source within the State Department is reiterated laterby McCarthy:(Mr. McCARTHY.) To those who say, “Why do you not tell the State Department; whydo you not give the names to the State Department?” I say that everything I havehere is from the State Department’s own files. I felt, when the State Departmentasked for the names, without being willing to cooperate or to work with us, itwas saying, “Tip us off; let us know on whom you have the goods.”Case No. 1. The names are available. The Senators may have them if they care forthem. I think however, it would be improper to make the names public until theappropriate Senate committee can meet in executive session and get them. I haveapproximately 81 cases. I do not claim to have any tremendous investigativeagency to get the facts, but if I were to give all the names involved, it mightleave a wrong impression. If we should label one man a Communist when he is nota Communist, I think it would be too bad. However, the names are here. I shallbe glad to abide by the decision of the Senate after it hears the cases, but Ithink the sensible thing to do would be to have an executive session and have aproper committee go over the whole situation. 37 [text00019.html#fn37]In other words, McCarthy was hoping for executive closed session to review thecases on a name-by-name basis, rather than the numbered cases he read into therecord, precisely to avoid openly discussing the State Department’s list by namein the public record.Shortly after this statement, McCarthy began to review the first case on hislist, and Majority Leader Lucas again asked McCarthy to yield:Mr. LUCAS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?Mr. McCARTHY. I yield.Mr. LUCAS. Will the Senator tell us the name of the man for the R ECORD? We areentitled to know who he is. I say this in all seriousness. The Senate and thepublic are entitled to know who that man is, as a result of the charge made bymy friend. If he is a Communist, the Senator from Wisconsin knows that theSenator from Illinois will go right along with the Senator from Wisconsin.Mr. McCARTHY. The Senator can come to my office as soon as I finish and receivethe names. I intend to go through all the cases. If it is the judgment of theSenate that it wants the names exposed on the Senate floor, which would be avery unusual procedure, I shall be glad to expose them. The question is tooimportant for either the Senator from Illinois or the Senator from Wisconsin tomake the decision. 38 [text00019.html#fn38]This important exchange between McCarthy and Lucas, Democratic Majority leader,is significant, for what McCarthy is really doing is placing the onus of “namingnames” in open session, and hence, the public record, on the majority party,something he knows it is unlikely to do. Somewhat later, in an exchange withSenator McMahon of Connecticut, McCarthy again suggests his information be goneover in executive session of any Senate committee. 39 [text00019.html#fn39] Inthis exchange with McMahon, McCarthy went on to state “I have said to theSenator that I am not indicting the 81. 40 [text00019.html#fn40] I have saidthere is sufficient in the files to show that there is something radicallywrong.” 41 [text00019.html#fn41]A short time later, yet another interesting exchange occurred between McCarthyand Republican Senator Owen Brewster of Maine:Mr. BREWSTER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?Mr. McCARTHY. I ask the Senator from Maine to permit me to answer the Senatorfrom Connecticut (McMahon) first.If the Senator from Connecticut had been here a little earlier, he would haveheard the majority leader demanding that we do exactly that. He demanded that Ipresent the names and indict these people before the country, without givingthem a chance to be heard.I said “No, I will not do that unless the Senate demands it.” I said, “I havethe information. I want to present it to any Senate committee, and have thecommittee decide about it.”This information is nothing new. It has been there a long time. If the Senatoror anyone else who is interested had expended sufficient effort, he could havebrought this to the attention of the Senate.I do not fancy at all this condemnation of an attempt to bring this matterbefore the Senate. I intend to give all the facts. From the information which Ihave before me, I agree with the intelligence agencies which have said, “Thesemen should not be in the State Department.” I agree with the intelligenceagencies who said “Do not give these men top-secret clearance.”I may be wrong. That is why I am not naming them. But I think thatsoon—tomorrow—the proper Senate committee that is actually interested, not ininvestigating people who may be Communists, but in investigating as to whetheror not the State Department is overrun with Communists, should examine intothese matters.Mr. BREWSTER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?Mr. McCARTHY. I yield.Mr. BREWSTER. Is not the essence of star-chamber proceedings that the public arenot permitted to know the facts? Is not the essence of the kind of governmentwhich we here are fighting the kind of executive government which refuses topermit the legislative authority to know the truth?After the revelations in the Hiss and the Fuchs and some other cases would itnot seem that the Congress should be permitted to exercise its historicalauthority, never denied until recent years; and does it not seem strange thatthe Executive would refuse to permit those in the Senate and in the House ofRepresentatives the right to know what is going on in Washington?I do not see how any defenders of democracy, in view of the Hiss and the Fuchscases, can still maintain the right of the executive department of government torefuse—as has been occurring repeatedly in recent years—information from thefiles to be authorized to be seen by the committees of Congress.Mr. McCARTHY. I may point out to the Senator that the Constitution gives theCongress the right to get the information which we have been demanding for sometime. Under the Constitution, of course, the Congress has a right to thatinformation. How we can force the President to give information to Congress I donot know. 42 [text00019.html#fn42]There then follows one of the most lengthy and remarkable exchanges, this timebetween Senator Garrett Withers of Kentucky, and McCarthy, when Withers makesanother attempt to get McCarthy to name names in open Senate session, which,again, McCarthy refused to do, unless the majority of the Senate wished to doso. 43 [text00019.html#fn43]Later, as McCarthy reads his anonymous cases into the record, Withers triesagain:Mr. WITHERS.…Does the Senator object to my divulging the names, if I see them?Have I that privilege?Mr. McCARTHY. I think it is up to the proper committee—Mr. WITHERS. I think we should tell the people who they are.Mr. McCARTHY. I think it is up to the proper committee to decide whether itwants to divulge the names. Let me make myself clear to the Senator. If themajority of the Senate want me to divulge them in that fashion, yes. But I amnot going to follow the Senator’s advice and say, “Here you are Senator, divulgethem.” Period. 44 [text00019.html#fn44]Around and around it goes, with both sides circling their wagons, with MajorityLeader Lucas making one more attempt to get McCarthy to name names in opensession of the Senate, with one clear goal being, according to Lucas, to getMcCarthy to “come forward, along with the persons in the Intelligence Departmentfrom whom he has been able to get the information in the State Department.” 45[text00019.html#fn45]The rest, of course, is history, as the Tydings committee was established todeal with McCarthy’s sensational charges, and there again, McCarthy made twoattempts to have all sessions “naming names” held in executive session. 46[text00019.html#fn46]b. An All Too Brief Look at The Tydings CommitteeEventually, of course, the Senate authorized the Tydings committee to hear andevaluate McCarthy’s charges. M. Stanton Evans summarizes what we have reviewed:This is a lot about a single matter, but it is a matter of utmost importance inassessing the usual image of McCarthy—and the stance of his opponents. Ratherthan McCarthy’s recklessly naming people in public as Communists or securityrisks without providing them a chance to answer, it was Senators Lucas andWithers who demanded that precisely such a course be followed, and it wasMcCarthy who adamantly refused to do so. 47 [text00019.html#fn47]Having established the Tydings committee to deal with McCarthy’s charges underthe understanding that all sessions would be conducted in the open, McCarthyprepared his cases and to testify in public session, and accordingly gave hiscases to the public. Only after this had been done, did the chairman, MillardTydings, on the first day of the hearings, offer to McCarthy to go intoexecutive closed session, after the Senator had handed the cases to the public,thinking that all sessions were to be open anyway. “With that,” M. Stanton Evansnotes, “the deed was done. ‘McCarthyism’ had at long last been committed, andMcCarthy would henceforth be held responsible for naming the names of hissuspects in open session, thus smearing them in public.” 48[text00019.html#fn48]B. Three Peculiar Episodes and Their Potential Meaning1. The Currency Plates EpisodeTempting as it may be to rehearse the entire McCarthy era and the charges andcounter-charges that reverberate down to our own day, our focus will now shiftto three curious cases that were brought before McCarthy’s own sub-committee. Aswas seen in the last chapter, Major Jordan disclosed the shipment of occupationcurrency plates to the Soviet Union, plates which eventually allowed the Sovietsto redeem occupation German marks for about $250,000,000 dollars.Needless to say, after the Republican sweep of 1952, McCarthy, now the head ofhis own committee with an investigative staff and subpoena power, began to probemore deeply, and one of these cases was precisely the transfer of the printingplates for the postwar occupation marks, “issued and redeemable by the UnitedStates” and which “were transferred to Soviet control by members of the treasurynetwork.” 49 [text00019.html#fn49] McCarthy committee member Karl Mundt quizzedFrank Coe about…a memo he wrote passing along a Soviet request for more dies to print theoccupation money… “At the time you wrote that memorandum, were you engaged inespionage activities in behalf of the Soviet government?” Coe replied, “Irespectfully, under the protection of the Fifth Amendment, decline to answer thequestion.” When Mundt further asked, “Are you now a member of the CommunistParty?” Coe respectfully passed on that one also. 50 [text00019.html#fn50]But there were much more serious money matters lurking in the wings.2. The China Problem: Henry Morgenthau and Chiang Kai-shek’s GoldMcCarthy, like many others in the United States House of Representatives and theUnited States Senate and in both parties, questioned why, and how, ChiangKai-Shek’s Nationalist China had been routed in 1949 by the Communists. In thisrespect, M. Stanton Evans mentions one significant episode:Especially notable were scenes in late 1944 and early ‘45, bracketing the Adlermemo to White on cutting off the flow of funds to Chiang. In these conclaves,Morgenthau kept asking his staff about the gold loan promised to KMT financeminister Kung. The Secretary was being badgered by Kung and was asking hisadvisors why the gold was not delivered. They patiently explained that therewere technical issues, shipping problems, glitches; and anyway the gold would bewasted on the corrupt regime of Chiang. An extremely candid version of thematter would be supplied by White, who admitted in so many words that the loanhad been deliberately obstructed.After his amazingly frank discussion of the gold loan record, White stillundertook to persuade Morgenthau that the Treasury had been right in itsobstructionism, “because the money is being badly used.” Others from time totime would discuss the issue with Morgenthau in similar fashion, suggesting thatthe gold be withheld or doled out in driblets. 51 [text00019.html#fn51]But as I noted in Covert Wars and Breakaway Civilizations, much Chinese gold,some 1,665 metric tons, was loaned by various Chinese in Chiang Kai-Shek’sgovernment in exchange for Federal Reserve Bearer Bonds bearing the name of U.S.Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau. 52 [text00019.html#fn52]In other words, putting two and two together, it appears that Chiang’s gold wassimply stolen, and American support for his government allowed to lapse, in thehopes that if his government fell, there would be no reason to return the gold.With Truman’s 1947 decision to create a hidden system of finance to fund covertoperations and black projects, the theft of this gold and its mere existencewould constitute a national security issue. McCarthy, by his persistinginquiries into the reasons for the expulsion of Chiang’s Nationalist governmentfrom mainland China, might have been getting too close to a massive nationalsecurity matter and secret, one that the Truman administration simply could notacknowledge in any fashion. It is also interesting to note that Morgenthau,whose name ostensibly appears on the 1934 “bearer bonds,” appears to be in thedark about all these matters. 53 [text00019.html#fn53]3. UFOs, and Dr. Edward Condon, Security RiskOne of the most intriguing and suggestive cases to come out of the whole postwarera, though not from McCarthy’s committee itself though certainly on his radarscreen, 54 [text00019.html#fn54] was Dr. Edward Condon, who was not only“sometime science advisor to the congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy”but also the center of an FBI investigation. 55 [text00019.html#fn55] Condon hadcome to the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee, which hadalso learned of an FBI report concerning him held by the Department of Commerce.56 [text00019.html#fn56] The wartime head of the atomic bomb project, theManhattan Project under General Leslie Groves, “who considered Oppenheimer anacceptable risk, did not so consider Condon.” 57 [text00019.html#fn57] WhateverCondon’s risks or associations may have been, it is the same Condon that wouldchair the US Air Force’s UFO study and report from 1966-1968.C. The Crucial Problematic of the Historical Record and Some SpeculationsWith the presence of Condon (and through him, the subject of UFOs), and“off-the-books” gold with all its implications for a hidden system of finance tofund covert operations and secret research, one is in the presence, perhaps, ofhidden reasons why the opposition not only to McCarthy, but to similarcongressional inquiries, was so intense; there were larger secrets to be kept,and Truman and later Eisenhower, intended to keep them. Similarly, all of thispoints out an obvious problematic of the historical record, yet one that hasgone unnoticed and thus, has never been commented or speculated upon. Whateverone makes of the whole arc of government inquiries into Communist espionage andpenetration of departments of the Federal government, from the Dies and LeeHouse Committees, the Nixon-Whittaker Chambers-Alger Hiss episode in the HouseUn-American Activities Committee, through McCarthy and beyond, and whatever onemakes of Senator McCarthy and his activities, the historical record is clear:there was Communist infiltration and penetration of the American government, anactivity that reached its height during the Roosevelt Administrations, andwhich, notwithstanding Truman’s own efforts to root it out, continued,oftentimes with known or identified security risks continuing to move from onedepartment to another, much to the perplexity of McCarthy and other Senators andCongressmen.The problematic occurs only when one juxtaposes this phenomenon with the equallyknown and documented fact that there was a similar Nazi penetration andinfluence within the Federal Government during the postwar period, not only inthe form of the now well-known Operation Paperclip which brought hundreds ofNazi scientists to this country to work in various advanced and covert Americanspace and military projects, but which also, in the form of the intelligenceagreements between Nazi major general 58 [text00019.html#fn58] Reinhard Gehlenand American intelligence, left Gehlen’s vast military intelligence organizationintact after World War Two—with Gehlen himself running it—as an integralcomponent of postwar American intelligence. The influence of this organizationduring the period immediately after the war upon American assessments of Sovietcapabilities and intentions was immense, with the Gehlen organization’s reportsand analyses often simply “retyped onto CIA stationary and presented toPresident Truman without further comment in the agency’s morning intelligencesummaries.” 59 [text00019.html#fn59]How, then, might one reconcile these two phenomena? What is their relationship,and how might that relationship have affected the events we have beensummarizing here? What role might the presence of Communists and Nazis withinthe Federal government have played behind the scenes? The possibilities andimplications are all disturbing—no matter how one slices the pie nor on whichside in the affair one falls. One overarching possibility, however, must bementioned, and that is that perhaps a great conflict between these twoideologies and their partisans within the American government were being playedout, perhaps unbeknownst to all but a few of the principals in the drama. Therequirements of establishing such possibilities are beyond the scope of thepresent book, but it should be noted that at the minimum, the dogged persistenceof the junior Senator from Wisconsin, his allies, and his enemies represented apotential threat to the whole tapestry of hidden arrangements of secret finance,and bargains with other, Fascist and not Communist, devils. For it isundeniable, and intriguing, that hovering on the peripheries of the whole arc ofthe efforts of the various congressional committees of the “McCarthy era” toexplore the depth of Communist infiltration, are the implications of hiddensystems of finance, Nazis, and UFOs, for that comprehensive history of thepostwar period of American politics, one encompassing and integrating all thesefactors, has yet to be written.1 [text00019.html#fn_1] M.

With an estimated yield of between 50 to 57 megatons(with some sources going as high as 67 megatons), the “Tsar Bomba” was thelargest man-made explosion ever achieved. The standard explanation was, andremains, that Nikita Khrushchev’s Soviet Union was flexing its thermonuclearmuscle by demonstrating that it could design a deliverable weapon of suchenormous destructive power. The test occurred during the Twenty-Second CommunistParty Congress, along with the test of a ballistic missile fired into theCentral Pacific ocean at a distance of approximately 8,000 miles. Wooden andbrick buildings 34 miles from ground zero were flattened and windows as far awayas Norway were broken, and the seismic shock wave sent through the Earth wasthat of a 5 point earthquake on the Richter scale, “echoing” around the entireplanet in measurable form no less than three times. 2 [text00020.html#fn2]Following the massive Soviet atmospheric test, the United States “conductedseveral small underground tests” 3 [text00020.html#fn3] The usual standardinterpretation of these events is that they were the final tests prior to thesigning of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, negotiated by President John F. Kennedy,and signed by the big three nuclear powers, the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates, and the Soviet Union.But what if these tests represented something very different, something havingthe appearance of an arms race, but in fact a highly covert and secretcoordinated effort? Given the Tsar Bomba’s test within the Arctic Circle and inthe atmosphere, and the smaller American underground tests which followed it, itis possible—at least from a physics point of view—that tests were really beingcoordinated to test planetary resonance and even, perhaps, those places wherethe seismic waves appeared to be “amplified” or “damped” on the world “grid.”Yet, for such tests to be coordinated would have required some sort ofgo-between, an intelligence presence both inside the Soviet Union and the UnitedStates with access to their respective test schedules, with access to those ableto schedule the tests, and with access to the results. During the early 1960s,of course, the only organization with such a presence in both countries, able torelay test schedules for any potential coordination was, of course, GeneralReinhard Gehlen’s organization, by now the official West German intelligenceestablishment, the Bundes-nachrichtendienst (BND).The mind boggles at the possibility that there may have been hidden coordinationof such nuclear tests, for it raises yet another possibility, namely, that theultimate purposes of such tests may not have been known either to the Soviet orAmerican scientists conducting them, concerned as they were with more mundanethings such as the yields of the weapons they were testing. However, all of thisis the purest radioactive speculation. There is nothing to suggest coordinationexcept the fact that the Tsar Bomba was atmospheric, and the post-Tsar BombaAmerican tests were underground, as if tests were being conducted on the entirecavity resonance system of planet Earth and her magnetosphere. In other words,there is nothing to suggest close coordination, except for the possible physicsitself.Communists, Nazis, Americans, hidden systems of finance, hydrogen bomb tests andplanetary resonance……but beyond this, there’s absolutely nothing to be concerned about.1 [text00020.html#fn_1] Christopher Storey, The European Union Collective, p.xxvii, emphasis in the original.2 [text00020.html#fn_2] “Tsar Bomba,” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba]3 [text00020.html#fn_3] Storey, op. cit., p. 127."},{"pageContent":"12CONCLUSIONS TO PART THREE“…it is possible that future generations will refer to the period 1914-presentas the ‘Second Hundred Years War.”‘ Peter Levenda 1 [text00021.html#fn1]T HE LABYRINTHINE TRAIL UPON WE HAVE EMBARKED twelve chapters ago is nowconcluded, and hence, it is necessary to recapitulate the conclusions of theprevious two parts of the book, and add to them the insights and implications ofthis last part of the book. We shall repeat verbatim the conclusions of theprevious parts, so that the added implications become clearer in the context:A. The Conclusions to Part One1)The Madrid Circular of 1950 was the alleged product of the German GeopoliticalCenter in Madrid, and thus allegedly of the postwar Nazi International. However,as was seen in chapter one, this author was unable to find any corroboration ofthe existence of this document beyond the books of T.H. Tetens. Thus, amethodology of corroboration had to be developed by seeking historicalantecedents within Imperial and Nazi Germany, and in postwar West German foreignpolicy. When viewed in this fashion, a number of the Circular’s policy positionsappear not only to have been adopted, but the Circular itself appears unusuallyprescient of developments occurring decades later. Among these developments, onemust take particular note of the following:a)The document advocates the creation of a European community, inclusive of acustoms union or common market, which federation would leave Germany, as thedominant economic power, in the position of the most influence. The purpose ofthe federation on the world stage is to create a “third way” between theopposing Communist and Atlantic blocs, with the federation serving to amplifyGerman geopolitical influence on the world stage;b)The Circular advocates the policy of promoting East-West bloc tensions even tothe point of a war between the USA and USSR, 2 [text00021.html#fn2] while theGerman-led Europe remained neutral in such confrontations, emerging as the clearleading power bloc after such a conflict. Certain key steps are involved inimplementing this strategy:i)The Rapallo Treaty of the 1920s between the Soviet Union and the WeimarRepublic is to be used to rearm West Germany and circumvent any treatyrestrictions imposed on it on the development of certain armaments capabilities,particularly atomic, biological, or chemical weapons of mass destruction. 3[text00021.html#fn3] As was seen in the previous pages, the Rapallo Prinzip wasfaithfully followed by the German Federal Republic as agreements for economiccooperation with “pariah nations” such as South Africa, Israel, and Iran wereused to disguise extensive military coordination and the technological transfersnecessary to acquire the complete nuclear fuel cycle, and nuclear andthermonuclear weapons, via proxy states. This extensive proliferation effortserves to create extraterritorial nuclear and thermonuclear capabilities in thehands of the large corporations and cartel arrangements making it possible, andalso creates a multi-layered redundancy in the proxy states utilizing Germannuclear technology, which includes continental Europe’s only declaredthermonuclear power, France.ii) The Circular explicitly states that “for us,” i.e., the Nazi International,“the war never stopped,” 4 [text00021.html#fn4] and draws clear support for thisin the lack of any formal representative of the Nazi Party at any of the formalsurrenders of 1945. The clear implication of this assertion is that the NaziInternational was alive and well in the heart of Germany and Europe itself, apoint corroborated in official British reports concerning the Naumann Coupattempt against Adenauer’s government, as will be seen below:iii)The long term goal was to isolate America via the short-term, andsuccessful, derailment of the Morgenthau Plan to de-industrialize Germany, 5[text00021.html#fn5] and then to manipulate the USA into increasing isolation ofits “dollar diplomacy” via engineered wars, economic crises, and destabilizationof the Middle East, 6 [text00021.html#fn6] while simultaneously the German-ledEuropean federation pivoted its economic trade to the East; 7[text00021.html#fn7]iv)Once this occurred, the USA would be forced to rely increasingly on more andmore force and a “unipolar attitude,” accurately anticipated by the Circular,and once this occurred, the terms of the Atlantic Alliance could be voided,since America will have become the aggressor nation, and the European nationswould be under no obligation to join its military ventures; 8[text00021.html#fn8]v)All of this would be accomplished via covert operations and an extensivenetwork of contacts in industry and government—including America 9[text00021.html#fn9] —a network which the Circular explicitly states may haveincluded personnel “executed for treason” in the July 1944 “bomb plot” againstAdolf Hitler, a breathtaking assertion either suggesting that the plot was adeliberate false flag event to deceive the Allies, protect high-ranking Nazis bymaking them “dead” to further Allied investigation (after all, one does notsearch for people one assumes are dead), or a crisis of opportunity exploited bythe Nazi hierarchy for the same purpose; 10 [text00021.html#fn10]2)The stated goal of the Madrid Circular of a German-led European federation wasin fact a consistent goal of members of the German military, political, andfinancial elite from General Bernhardi and Reichskanzler Theobald vonBettmann-Hollweg prior to and during World War One, to post-World World war TwoWest German Chancellors from Adenauer to Helmut Kohl, Gerhard Schröder andAngela Merkel. While we have yet to examine the Nazis and their own statementsand plans for European Union in any detail, which will be the main subject ofthe next part of this book, what is evident thus far is that the Madrid Circularaccurately reflects the consistency of this vision;a)We have noted, however, that certain Nazi documents beginning in 1943 andcontinuing right to the end of the war, including Generalplan 1945, advocatedsuch a German-led European federation. Additionally, we noted that theGeneralplan 1945 spelled this out in terms of political federation, economicunion, and as will be seen in the next part of this book, an amalgamation of lawand jurisprudence. This union is to eventually include European Russia in itsembrace. 11 [text00021.html#fn11]b)Those wartime Nazi documents also advocated a policy of psychological warfareagainst the Western powers, and we suggested in the previous pages that theNaumann Coup attempt against Adenauer’s government, the responsibility for whichthe British explicitly laid at the feet of the postwar Nazi International, wasone such operation, since the operation allowed the Adenauer government,notwithstanding its own Nazis and pro-Nazi sympathizers, to appear moderate.3)Finally, we observed the pattern of interlocking corporate and cartel drivenmilitary and political manipulation of Islam by means of radicalizing it, and inradicalizing it, weaponizing it for use in destabilizing the Middle East andupsetting British and American interests in the region. The result, again, hasbeen exactly that as predicted by the Madrid Circular, for as Washington mustincreasingly use a heavy hand in the region, it becomes increasingly isolated.In the case of the German nuclear “cartel,” we discovered that the Germannuclear industry, in its historical roots, is comprised largely of the componentcompanies of the IG Farben cartel, all working in concert, a point whichsuggests that while Farben may be officially dead in name, it is dead only inname. Given the consistent connection of German policy toward radical Islam, andits promotion of jihad since the days of the Kaiser and its consistent abilityto endure shifts of government in Iran from World War Two through the overthrowof both Mossadegh and the Shah, the known Nazi connections to other radicalIslamic groups, it was even suggested that the “war on terrorism” might be aconvenient cover for a war on the Nazi International, a war which America andher allies would have great difficulty selling to their populations.B. Conclusions to Part Two4)Definite parallels exist between the structure of the Exchange Rate Mechanismof the 1980s and 1990s, and today’s European Union, and the wartime plans of theNazis in the following respects:a)“Peter Oldfield’s,” a.k.a. Per Jacobssen’s novel The Alchemy Murderi detailsinterwar League of Nations recommendations for the construction of enormouschemicals cartels with sufficient power:(i) to oppose the warmaking powers of nation-states;(ii) to establish and maintain international economic order;(iii) to function as a mechanisms and agents of technology transfer via patentsand licensing agreements;(iv) As was seen, however, the only cartel of such international extent was I.G.Farben, which functioned as the principal component of the Nazi war machine;b)The Bank of International Settlements was conceived by German banker HjalmarSchacht as an independent “sovereign” entity ostensibly for the purpose tohandle war reparations payments, but functioned in practice, particularly duringthe war, as the international agent and clearinghouse for Nazi cartel interests.There are definitive indicators that the BIS functioned, and may still function,as the central and principal component of a hidden system of finance in thefollowing ways:(i) Given its “sovereign” status, the BIS is allowed diplomatic pouchimmunities, and was and is thus in a position to launder bearer-securities ofall types, as well as currencies, a function which it performed during the war;(ii) The Nazis in the form of Karl Blessing, Kurt von Schröder, IG Farben COEHerman Schmitz and other Schacht-sponsored appointees to its Board of Governors,viewed the Bank and its utopian objectives—those having to do with the meme ofthe obsolescence of the nation-state—as being exploitable by the Nazi-Cartelregime, which had adopted similar language for its own purposes of Europeanpower politics;(iii) The continuity of the political and financial “European-Reich” outlook ofthe Nazi-Farben alliance is continued after the war by the prominent position ofNazi financiers in postwar German financial institutions, such as Blessing’spresence in the postwar West German Bundesbank;(iv) As such, the BIS was also viewed as a principal means for the postwarmitigation of Allied treatment of Germany and was a key component of Nazisurvival, and the Party’s strategic evacuation plans to move large amounts ofcapital out of Europe;(v) The BIS functioned as a principal means of the continuation of wartimecontact between the German financial-cartel elite on the one hand, withsympathetic American counterparts such as the Dulles-Bush-Harriman “axis” thatran through the Wall Street firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, via its wartimeAmerican president Thomas H. McKittrick; 12 [text00021.html#fn12](vi) Given its ability to move physical paper, in the form of agreements,securities, currency, and so on via diplomatic pouch, the speculative suggestionwas advanced that the move to digital cashless societies might be a move of thefinancial power elite to maintain “transparency” of public finances, whilemaintaining its own opacity to public scrutiny. This view was argued in thecontext that a hidden system of finance might an very well would be dependent onthe movement of physical paper—in the form of bearer bonds and other bearerinstruments—through a system of “diplomatic pouch” immunity such as is possessedby the Bank of International Settlements. A hidden system based on such “bearerinstruments” and the movement of actual physical paper through such channelswould be totally opaque to any public oversight or individual national scrutiny.This would allow the creation of a truly international system of hidden finance,one that could very well be utilized for the funding of black projects on aninternational scale and order. In such a system, an institution like the BISwould be essential, for the BIS essentially functioned as a kind of Venetianbanco di scitta, but on an international scale. These facts and specualtions mayexplain why the BIS survived and outlived its ostensible purpose of handlinginterwar reparations payments, and why it survives today, though theSchacht-Sukarno episode indicates that other banks are involved in this system;c)The joint plans of the Nazi Party-I.G. Farben “coalition” and “marriage”focused on a staged integration of a European Reich or federation around aGerman core and leadership. This staged development focused on two principalmeans, techniques, and areas:(i) A “European Reich” project would first require the harmonization of variousEuropean nations’ patent law, as outlined by Walter Hallstein in his infamous“Hegemony Speech,” and by Sölter’s 1942 study. The principal means by which thiscould be quickly and effectively accomplished was by bypassing national andprovincial legislatures and parliaments, by establishing European-wideregulatory bureaucracies to oversee different areas of the “large space” (i.e.,Euroepan) economy and markets. This, as was seen, bears an uncanny resemblanceto the bureaucratic structure of the current European Union, which, as was seen,showed Walter Hallstein involved at every crucial step in its formation. CERN,it should be noted, was one such agency created, and was given, like the BIS, a“cartel” and “trust”-like structure, and a kind of limited sovereignty.(ii) Coincidental to this, a “Reichsmark” zone would be established based on theidea of “margin-pegs” of other currencies within the zone to the Reichsmark, aplan that, again, was fulfilled by the establishment and operation during the1980s and 1990s of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, wherein other Europeancurrencies, including eventually the French franc and Italian lire were peggedto the West German Deutschmark.5)The pattern of the close relationship between high finance and high technologyand physics, a pattern begun in ancient times, is continued in Europe’s CERN,which has, as noted, a limited kind of “sovereign status” in international law,making it a perfect candidate for conducting a twin-track system of experiments,a public one, and a secret or covert one, since there is no single nation stateoverseeing it. As a “European” institution, however, the influence of the largermember-nations within it is palpable, particularly that of Germany which, as wasalso seen, was CERN’s largest contributor. Given the fact that CERN admits thatits Large Hadron Collider is designed to create and detect the creation ofquark-gluon condensates, antimatter-matter asymmetry experiments, and so on, itmay also be viewed as continuing the wartime pattern of the Kammlerstab which,according to a British intelligence agent, worked in “monstrous areas of physicson a daily basis.” Additionally, other factors are indicative of the possibilityof hidden or covert projects within the LHC experimental management structure:a)CERN’s Large Hadron Collider represents a “cosmology cartel and trust,” sinceit has control over:(i) the machines of the accelerators and the Collider itself, thus making anytruly independent verification of its experiments impossible;(ii) the information generated from its experiments; and,(iii) the “filtration” or selection of data from those experiments to becommunicated to its member scientists for study and interpretation.b)The “data filtration algorithms” however, suggest the possibility that therejected raw data could be siphoned and filtered itself, and thus thepossibility arises that other experiments in the form of data correlationsbetween Collider activities and other systems such a weather and geological orgeophysical systems, might be coordinated secretly;c)Finally, in our extremely speculative scenario, we suggested the possibilitythat the Collider and its Detectors, along with the involved scientists, mightbe creating the effects they observe as artifacts of the machine itself, when itis understood from a “Kronian” point of view that all electrical machines arenetworks of hyper-dimensional spaces. In this respect, we also suggested theextremely speculative notion that one aspect of a covert or secret experimentthat might be being run is a socio-physical engineering experiment to tests theeffects(if any) and limits of group observers on physical experiments. If suchextreme speculations were true, it would indeed constitute another example of“working in monstrous areas of physics on a daily basis.”C. Conclusions and Implications of Part Three5)Postwar American domestic politics occurred in the crucible of theconfrontation of various Congressional committees with the reality of wartimeCommunist infiltration of, and influence over, the various departments andpolicies of the Federal government, most notably and famously, or, dependingupon one’s lights, infamously embodied and symbolized in the investigations ofWisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, though certainly not confined to him. Duringthis era, a number of peculiar connections emerged, includinga)connections between American Far Eastern policy, especially toward China, andthe theft of Nationalist China’s gold, a subject intimately connected to theBearer Bonds Scandals and the establishment by President Truman in 1947 of anentirely hidden system of finance based upon recovered Axis loot;b)the transfer of American occupational marks engraving plates from the USA tothe USSR during the course of World War Two, via Lend-Lease shipments;c)the transfer of crucial atom-bomb secrets and components from the USA to theUSSR under the direct and explicit authorization of a high advisor to PresidentFranklin Roosevelt in the form of Harry Hopkins;d)the presence of Dr. Edward Condon as a “security risk” in the nationalsecurity architecture of the USA, in judgment of Manhattan Project chief GeneralLeslie Groves. While Condon was never directly involved in any of the McCarthycommittee probes, he was certainly known to the Senator, as well as to otherCongressional security committees, as a potential security risk. This places hisauthorship of the subject US Air Force sponsored UFO study, the Condon report ofthe 1960s, into a curious light, for it implies a potential ability to blackmailor otherwise coerce Dr. Condon into making the “correct” findings on thesubject. Put differently, Condon’s dubious status in the estimates of somepersons within the national security establishment make the potential of outsidecovert influence on his committee possible, and thus vitiate any claims toobjectivity his UFO study may have.6)The presence both of Nazis and of Communists within postwar American federaldepartments and agencies suggests the possibility that much of the postwarsecurity struggles—as exemplified in the various postwar Congressionalcommittees of the “House Un-American Activities Committee-McCarthy era”—may havebeen public manifestations of much deeper and more hidden confrontations betweenthose two factions and their American allies on the political left and right inthe postwar U.S.A. Consequently, no adequate and detailed historical study yetexists of the potential interplay between these forces and factions within thepostwar American national security state, its covert operations, black researchprojects (inclusive of the UFO issue), and the hidden systems of financedesigned to fund them. Put differently, previous studies of this crucial periodhave concentrated only on one aspect of the problem: the claims of McCarthy, orthe effect of Nazi recruitment in Operation Paperclip, or the beginning of theUFO phenomenon and the response to it, and so on. But I believe enough has beenpresented here, and in some of my previous books, to indicate that anintegrative approach to all these things and to the historiography of the periodis needed. 13 [text00021.html#fn13]One thing does, however, emerge clearly from the previous chapters: the ideathat there was no “Nazi International” would appear to be belied by the postwarrealities in Europe, and by their all too detailed resemblance not only to thewar aims of Germany in both World Wars, but also by the parallels between thedetailed planning of the Nazis during the Second World War, and contemporaryEuropean Union institutions. More importantly, the uncanny prescience of theMadrid circular, a document composed in 1950, would appear to have been morethan vindicated by the course of events from then until now. And perhaps mostdisturbingly of all, that new “Europe,” like its Nazi and Fascist forebears,seems to be involved in potentially monstrous physics experiments on a dailybasis.With both Nazis and Communists in the mix and potentially in conflict behind thescenes domestically and internationally, with a hidden system of finance andcolossal science projects playing with anti-matter and searching for “a newphysics” within an institution that has a kind of international sovereign statusall of its own, the stakes are too high to ignore the possibilities presented bythe two great socialist ideologies of the twentieth century lurking in thebackground.1 [text00021.html#fn_1] Peter Levenda, The Hitler Legacy, p. 59.2 [text00021.html#fn_2] p. 9.

Hisappointment may thus be viewed as designed to protect mutual American and Cartelfinancial and industrial interests in postwar Germany. Accordingly, his pardonof over 70,000 Nazis in the postwar era should be viewed with some suspicion.13 [text00021.html#fn_13] Yet another crucial factor to be examined from anyintergrative historiographical viewpoint is the Reese committee on the power andinfluence of foundations."},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYNo author. “French Sub-Launched M51 Missile Test-Fired.” Jan. 27, 2010.
