Consider it more a reference book designed to meet three distinct aims: 1. Provide the relevant historical basis for understanding the existence and coverup of CIA child trafficking, ritual abuse, and mind control. 2. Document my personal experience of this abuse in Australia and the USA . 3. Offer information for combating the techniques which cults, the military and intelligence agencies use to artificially induce dissociation and achieve radical and strategic behaviour modification. I explain the nature of Trauma-Based Forced Dissociation including the victim selection process, why most therapy is ineffective, and why a Trauma-Focussed Integration approach is essential . My testimony is scaffolded by the extraordinary research of Steve McMurray who assembled the jigsaw of faces, places, and relationships I recalled and relayed. Steve ’s work features mainly in the chapter MK-ULTRA in Australia . This book would not exist, and my integration would not have been as thorough, without Steve’s research efforts. The following publications provide a preliminary understanding of ritual abuse and mind control, which my book builds upon: - Secret Don’t Tell: The Encyclopedia of Hypnotism (1998) by Carla Emery. - How the Illuminati Create an Undetectable Total Mind Controlled Slave (2008) and Bloodlines of the Illuminati (1998) by Fritz Springmeier and his wife ‘Cisco Wheeler .’ - A Nation Betrayed: Secret Cold War Experiments Performed on Our Children and Other Innocent People (2002) by Carol Rutz. - The Greenbaum Speech (199 2-3) conference presentation by Dr Corydon Hammond. The Bible suggests we may know them by their fruits . That is, we recognise the wolves in sheep skins by the consequences of their words and behaviour. Be they arrogant academic or bottom-feeding troll, anyone who attempts to discredit the above writings is certainly an operative for the trafficking network. Similarly, whoever attacks my book has a vested interest in the lucrative international child trafficking operation coordinated by the CIA. This electronic version of Eyes Wide Open is being distributed at no cost because the truth and healing ought to be free. Victims have paid enough. The public is welcome to download, distribute and host complete copies of this book version online for therapeutic purposes. Flooding the internet with multiple copies combats the increasing censorship and stops the child traffickers burying this information again."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 1 Watergate was Pedogate The Watergate break -in was strictly based on one thing - the pedophile records that were being kept at the Democratic National Headquarters. - Detective James Rothstein ( NYPD, Retired ) In October 2016, I presented at Colin Ross’ Trauma and Dissociation conference in Seattle, USA. Following my talk, one attendee approached me in the hotel lobby where my fellow presenters sat at their merchandise stalls. ‘All this!’ she shouted while sweeping her arm across the sideshow alley of over -priced books, stickers, and fridge magnets, ‘All this is shit! You have the real stuff! Where’s your book?!’ Tears welled in her eyes. ‘Write a book! Please write a book!’ Yes, I have the real stuff. I am not some left -brain dominant academic pretending to understand what it is like to be a victim of the most heinous crimes. I lived it. I spent my developmental years trapped in a mind control labyrinth. I spent my adult years navigating an escape. I eventually achieved what few victims of the most extreme abuse do, integration. I may there fore declare with authority what does and does not work. I prefer the term ‘ victim’ to ‘ survivor ’ because the latter implies my ordeal is over. My ordeal will likely never end. As Dr Reina Michaelson warned, ‘Fiona, I think this is a life sentence.’ Indeed, I serve a life sentence for crimes committed against me, with the full knowledge and blessing of the Australian government. I am constantly harassed by police, paid agitators, agent academics and journalists, DID sleeper cells, perpetrator relatives, sold- out victims, fake advocates, professional social media trolls, police SOIs (special intelligence operatives), and retired intelligence community thugs hired to do the dirty work of VIPs who dare not overtly attack me for fear of attracting media attention to their part in the international child trafficking operation. Recovery from extreme abuse beg ins with realising the true nature and extent of international child trafficking. In 2015, Newcastle Herald journalist Ian Kirkwood wrote favourable articles in the wake of my Sydney press conference . 1 I consequently passed to him a story regarding David Hogg, the Lifestyle Solutions founder who was later convicted of historical child sexual assault. Kirkwood worked with Joanne McCarthy whose media campaign, starring whistle-blower Peter Fox, helped spark Australia’s Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse . In 2012, Detective Chief Inspector Peter Fox expose d his colleagues’ coverup of a massive pedophile network in the Newcastle Catholic diocese . The NSW police hierarchy consequently physically threatened Peter Fox and demanded his doctor allow police to attend his private therapy sessions . University of Sydney law graduate Margaret Cunneen chaired a Special Commission of Inquiry into child sex abuse in Newcastle which attacked and discredited Peter Fox and journalist Joanne McCarthy . Cunneen had a history of supporting pedophiles. In 2009 she attended the book launch of organised crime boss Roger Rogerson and admitted she had ‘known him since he 1 Ian Kirkwood (2015). Franca Arena was Right on the Mark . Newcastle Herald . 30 October."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 2 was a detective.’ 2 Detective Sergeant Roger Rogerson was dismissed from the NSW Police Force in 1986, meaning Cunneen associated with him during his underbelly heyday when he oversaw the trafficking of drugs and children in Sydney , and committed multiple murders to conceal his crimes . Then i n 2002, Margaret Cunneen advised Queensland Police to drop their prosecution of pedophile swim coach Scott Volkers on the grounds: (a) one victim’s sexual assault was too ‘trivial’ to prosecute ; (b) 12-year-old female victims were unlikely to have developed breasts and thus allegations Volkers groped them would be difficult to substantiate ; and (c) 12-year-old girls could not relax enough to experience orgasm while being abused. 3 First ly, Cunneen’s conclusions defy biology. Secondly, m y sister-in-law was Scott Volker’s assistant coach in the 1990s. Long before Volkers hit the news, I was told he assaulted his own niece whom he regularly drove to swimming practise , that his pedophilia was common knowledge to Queensland Swimming staff including Greg Lawler who caught Volkers showering naked with Olympian Samantha Riley , and that Swimming Australia was generally infested with pedophiles including National Coach Don Talbot (my first swim teacher) who was deported from Canada for impregnating a 14-year-old - prior to being appointed as Australia’s head Olympic coach. The federal Royal Commission into child abuse subsequently vindicated both Peter Fox plus the multiple victims of Scott Volkers who in 2018 was finally charged for the same crimes Margaret Cunneen dismissed. Cunneen was further discredited when Roger Rogerson was convicted of murder in 2014. Cunneen narrowly escaped investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption in 2015. As Chair of the Special Commission of Inquiry, Margaret Cunneen banned Peter Fox from including crucial evidence thereby prejudicing his testimony . She subjected Fox to hours and days of aggressive interrogation, and facilitated his being slandered ‘a liar, ’ ‘the devil incarnate ,’ ‘obsessed’ with exposing pedophile priests, and involved in a ‘ conspira cy’ with Newcastle Herald journalist Joanne McCarthy who was also interrogated under cross examination. Cunneen branded Fox an ‘unreliable ’ witness who acted ‘without integrity .’ I enjoyed afternoon tea with Peter Fox and witnessed the toll this took on someone who victims consider a national hero. If only all NSW police were as obsessed with exposing pedophiles. The NSW Police Force then targeted Deputy Police Commissioner Nick Kaldas for supporting Peter Fox. Kaldas was suddenly subject ed to excessive scrutiny, investigation, public discredit ing and career destruction. Margaret Cunneen’s witch hunt occurred under the command of NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione who publicly supported pedophile Frank Houston, the Hillsong founder who sex trafficked kids to Kings Cross brothels in association with fellow child rapist Roger Rogerson. So, if the Newcastle Herald would not publish my story, I figured, no other newspaper would. I phoned Ian Kirkwood to request he investigate and publish my full story. If only one mainstream journalist published my testimony against Antony Kidman, I reasoned, it would 2 Kate McClymont (2011). An unusual meeting of minds.

During our call, Kirkwood relayed a conversation he once had with ‘a couple of spooks’ who told him that all senior politicians are pedophiles because that is how they are controlled. Kirkwood asked me if that was my story. ‘That’s exactly right! That’s consistent with my experience .’ I tried to contain my excitement. ‘The mainstream media has long documented the CIA’s involvement in drugs and weapons trafficking, right?’ Kirkwood agreed, noting there had just been another story about that in the mainstream press. ‘Well then, is it so hard to imagine they are also involved in trafficking children which is far more lucrative than guns and drugs? ASIO and the CIA work together to traffic children between Australia and America. They’re the ones who trafficked me.’ The journalist promised to consider my request, bearing in mind he had a young family and publishing my story would surely place them at risk. But he never got back to me. A short time later, Ian Kirkwood developed a rare and aggressive form of cancer. I called him, expressed my condolences, and we chatted for a bit. At the end of our conversation, I mentioned I was considering writing a book. I asked him to clarify and elaborate on what he told me of his encounter with the ‘spooks.’ ‘I never said that,’ he bluntly asserted. I sighed in resignation. There went my last chance at breaking into the mainstream media. There sunk years of building rapport and credibility with mainstream journalists. There went years of investigating other abuse cases and passing my findings on to television and newspapers. Years of driving journalists around the district to personally meet victims. Years of results in other cases. My Gold Coast Hogtie Doctor story went international, with paediatrician Neville Davis being banned from practising medicine in Australia (although that doesn’ t stop him setting up shop in Thailand). My story on Gary Willis’ 18-year child abuse spree ended with a life ban on his teaching for the NSW Education Department (although that didn’ t stop him working for the Queensland Education Department). My story on Daruk government boys home forced reluctant NSW police and 60 Minute s agent journalists to conduct a mop-up investigation. I broke the Daruk story on my blog and negotiated it into the mainstream news. Sensational headlines about a victim having his penis cut off went global. Police and the media charged multiple low-level perpetrators, and 60 Minutes falsely presented the story as ‘exclusive.’ Police and media conspired to bury the crux of the Daruk story , that it was a recruitment centre for (a) boy prostitutes used to service ASIO’s human compromise operation, and (b) Project MK -ULTRA lab rats. Journalists may print all sorts of child abuse information, except that which exposes the global child trafficking operation. I had come so close. My October 2015 press conference – delivered in response to Senator Bill Heffernan’s announcement that a former prime minister was a pedophile - was statistically the most popular story on the Sydney Morning Herald website that day (although the news site’s computer technicians prevented it from displaying as the most viewed article ). Another of Prime Minister Bob Hawke’s sex assault victims, the daughter of Hawke’s architect Kevin Borland, agreed to address a follow-up press conference with me but pulled out last minute. The USA National Inquirer intended to run a front-page story about Antony Kidman"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 4 being a pedophile , until they received a vicious legal threat from his daughter Nicole Kidman. A journalist and her photographer husband flew up from Sydney to interview me for a major Australian magazine, until Nicole Kidman took a ‘Scientology approach to managing’ me. And a UK journalist travelled around the country interviewing me and two other victims of Antony Kidman for the Daily Mail , until one of the victims (whose parents were friends with Kidman) was threatened and subsequently withdrew his permission last minute. Nicole Kidman’s PR team shut down my mainstream media exposure by drawing on her lucrative contracts with Australia’s media outlets. So, I turned to the internet. Armed with a simpl e meme app and a right-brain talent for lyric writing, I launched my own social media campaign. I spent five years in front of the computer, communicating with hundreds of victims and supporters, many fake , many genuine. I hit the conspiracy theory jackpot when David Icke featured an enormous photograph of me and my story during his Australian speaking tour. My tactics worked. Online articles about Nicole Kidman, where the public was free to leave negative comments, were followed by streams of intelligent attacks on her heavily orchestrated stardom. I realised my impact when Kidman’s PR team paid the Daily Mail plus a morning television show to feature an article tellingly title d, ‘ Shame on you, Australia. Stop Hating on Nicole Kidman .’ 4 People don’t hate Nicole Kidman as an individual. They hate what the Harvey Weinstein scandal subsequently highlighted: that Hollywood rewards something other than an ability to sing, dance or ac t. Despite everything the pedophile network threw at me , my story still got out there, such that if you Google Antony Kidman’s name the words ‘child abuse’ soon follow. Yet no amount of alternative media success can match a complete break into mainstream news. So, I admitted defeat. I stopped posting and did not bother checking my blog sites. Pedogate Days before the 2016 US Presidential Election, I received a barrage of phone texts from old friends asking if I was okay. People started questioning my kids regarding our family’s welfare. I had no idea what was happening. Then I checked my blog site. A spike of 100,000 views in one day stemmed from an article that activist group Anonymous published about my being trafficked to American VIPs as a kid. They used my story to expose Hillary Clinton’s involvement in a child sex trafficking ring. The Clinton Foundation was a front for the trafficking of children including Haiti earthquake victims. Bill and Hilary’s trafficking network implicated campaign chairman John Podesta, billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, and ‘Saint’ Mother Teresa. In 1995, the Nobel Peace Prize recipient opened a Mother Teresa Home for Infant Children adoption centre in Washington DC with Hillary Clinton which quietly closed in 20 02. 5 Mother Teresa’s Roman Catholic order, Missionaries of Charity, came under Indian government investigation for child trafficking, with 4 Angela Mollard (2017).

Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficked minors to VIPs including Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, Prince Andrew, Kevin S pacey, and Bill Clinton who flew aboard the Lolita Express to Epstein’s ‘Little St. James’ pedo island in the Caribbean. Epstein is among the many VIPs and government heads who knowingly donated money to the Clinton Foundation child trafficking operation. T he Clinton Foundation received $88 million from Australian taxpayers between 2006 and 2014, peaking during Welsh-born Australian ALP Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s term. 8 Hilary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother Tony Podesta were staying in a Portuguese villa owned by UK politician Sir Clement Freud, in the same resort where British child Madeleine McCann was when she disappeared. Clement Freud was Sigmund Freud’s grandson. British media outed Clement Freud as a violent child rapist. 9 John and Tony Podesta perfectly matched the identikit images Scotland Yard released of Madeleine’s abductors. Pedogate , as the scandal became known, surfaced when Wikileaks released emails from John Podesta’s account in October 2016. The emails notably outed Hillary Clinton as a self -confessed ‘Molech’ worshipper, and captured politicians ordering children for pedophile parties using alleged fast-food code words. The content of the Podesta emails is consistent with the following leak from a CIA cut-out company called STRATFOR: _________________________________________________ From: Fred Burton [mailto:burton@stratfor.com] Sent: Thursday, May 14, 2009 2:39 PM To: 'Don Kuykendall' Cc: 'Aaric Eisenstein'; 'Darryl O'Connor'; 'Copeland Susan' Subject: RE: Get ready for ‘Chicago Hot Dog Friday’ I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax -payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago, assume we are using the same channels? _________________________________________________ A related email from STRATFOR’s president informed Aaric Eisenstein (of SVP Publishing): ‘Aaric, you can participate as well!’ ‘If we get the same ‘waitresses,’ I'm all for it!!!’ Aariac Eisenstein replied.

The leaked emails prompted Hilary Clinton to publicly declare Australian award-winning journalist and whistle-blower Julian Assange a ‘dead man walking.’ Child p rostitutes visiting the Whitehouse is old news. On 29 June 1989, the front page of the Washington Times read: HOMOSEXUAL PROSTITUTION INQUIRY ENSNARES VIPs WITH REAGAN, BUSH: ‘CALL BOYS’ TOOK MIDNIGHT TOUR OF WHITE HOUSE The sensational headline concerned the Franklin Scandal in Omaha Nebraska that David Shurter was a victim of and witness to. Shurter is also a victim of my perpetrator Lt. Col. Michael Aquino who was implicated in Franklin plus the Presidio and McMartin preschool scandals in which children were sexually and ritually abused. Pedogate whistle-blowers claimed, children trafficked to Washington DC were held in transit cellars within local businesses including a restaurant where an ‘entertainer’ was filmed boasting about raping and killing kids. Clean FBI and NYPD officers apparently made multiple attempts to char ge Hillary Clinton and other VIP members of the trafficking ring, but their efforts were thwarted by those in the chain of command above them. One of the attempted charges related to a video of Hillary Clinton and her bisexual lover Huma Aberdeen (wife of pedophile Anthony Weiner) conducting a Luciferian ritual in which they skinned the face off a live young girl. The dissemination of this video was the said reason behind YouTube’s global shutdown that occurred in late 2018 while I was online. Someone later posted forensic photos of the skinned victim on my Twitter feed which I automatically viewed. Mainstream media giants launched a cover -up campaign against the leaked Podesta emails and related crimes, to muddy the waters and leave the general public confused about the truth. The likes of CNN (founded by my pedophile rapist Ted Turner) successfully drew the public’s attention from what was contained in the emails, to who might have leaked them and spread ‘fake news.’ The pedophiles coined t he term ‘fake news’ in reaction to the publication of Podesta’s emails. Clinton herself never addressed or denied the email contents. The emails were said to have been leaked by US Intelligence community staff opposed to organised pedophilia. Mainstream journalists whose reports were consistent with this version of events were promptly fired. Further, over 100 Clinton staff and associates met untimely deaths, in quick succession, just like the many witnesses to JFK’s assassination, and the victim of and witnesses to Kevin Spacey ’s sexual assaults. Pedogate was discredited as ‘fake news’ despite NBC’s (11 June 2 013) televised report regarding Hillary Clinton using her position as US Secretary of State to cease an investigation into child sex trafficking within the State Department. Despite the mainstream media blackout, Pedogate reached the public via social media. YouTube featured interviews with credible witnesses who testified to the existence of an international child sex trafficking operation involving US politicians and the CIA. That was when I noticed retired NYPD Detectiv e James Rothstein. Pedogate , he explained in interview, was the same VIP pedophile network he investigated for 35 years. The perpetrators were doing everything in their power to shut the Pedogate story down, Rothstein observed. He"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 7 predicted the perpetrator s would successfully bury it just like every other time their network was almost exposed, including the Franklin, Presidio, and McMartin scandals. Rothstein explained that the NYPD was no ordinary state police force, but a leading investigative agency with national and international offices. Back in 1966, Rothstein became the first police detective assigned to investigate the prostitution industry. Almost immediately he discovered an underground sexual blackmail operation that compromised politicians with child prostitutes. ‘Human Compromise’ is what he labelled the honey -trap process. Rothstein and his colleagues found that approximately 70 percent of top US Government leaders were compromised in this way. Rothstein said, the CIA conducted the human compromise operation, while the FBI was tasked with covering up any leaks. The CIA trafficked the kids, the FBI covered the ir tracks. A subsequent news article validated Rothstein’s allegation against the FBI: Prince Andrew’s role in Jeffrey Epstein paedo scandal is being covered up by the FBI, claims ex top cop who say he has hours of damning CCTV footage Jon Lockett, The Sun , 25 Sep 2019 ... John Mark Dougan - who fled to Moscow following a raid by the Feds on his home - also says he has hundreds of hours of footage from the billionaire paedo's Florida mansion... James Rothstein said he was alerted to an identical VIP pedophile ring operating in the UK when Scotland Yard consulted him regarding the Profumo Affair . U K agents visited Rothstein in New York to extract anything he knew about British politicians and other VIPs having sex with child prostitutes. Britain were in damage control, tying up loose ends, covering up the true pedophile nature of the Profumo Affair. Here is my email exchange with Rothstein concerning this incident: _________________________________________________ From: Fiona Sent: Sunday, July 29, 2018 6:24 PM To: Jim Subject: CIA Hollywood pedophiles being exposed Incidentally, someone criticised my writing saying the Profumo Affair was 1963 and before your appointment, and so you are a disinfo agent.

They did not do the follow up until a number of years later after the Profumo case broke. My source in the business knew the whole story. They were making sure that there were no other connection to the operation we had in New York. Here is a copy of the actual report. The part they were looking for was from 1963. In the late 60’s, Rothstein is called to attend a meeting with a number of New York Police Department officials and two agents from Scotland Yard at a high- end restaurant on the Upper East Side. (They picked up the tab). Scotland Yard was following up on t he Profumo Scandal in 1963. They were trying to find out if their national security had been compromised. Profumo had used the services of Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice Davies. The two girls had also been involved with a Russian, Yevgeny Ivanov. The conn ection in New York was that Keeler and Davies had been associated with a high -level prostitution ring operating out of an apartment on Fifty Sixth Street and Second Avenue. Rothstein calls on Peggy to determine who was operating the ring and what was going on at the prostitution operation on 56 St. and 2nd Ave. Rothstein conducted an in -depth investigation using Peggy’s information and determined that the association between Keeler, Davies, and the Madam of the Prostitution House on 56 St. and 2 Ave. were i n fact true. The information Rothstein gleaned from the investigation verified that the location was being used to set -up and compromise victims. Rothstein believes it is a sanctioned State of the Art, High -End human intelligence and human compromise opera tion. The late 60’s was 68 -69. I became a cop in 1965 Feb. 15. _________________________________________________ Rothstein and his law enforcement associates realised the international pedophile rings were all connected. He said the VIP members met at various world locations where each destination catered for a different type of degenerate sexual proclivity, including ‘satanic - themed’ abuse. Rothstein said he and his colleagues encountered fierce resistance to the investigation and prosecution of members of the child trafficking operation. His journalist contacts at the New York Times and Washington Post could not get stories about the VIP ring printed. All police, FBI, customs and IRS officers who pursued the VIP pedophile network above street level had their careers subsequently destroyed. Rothstein’s attempts to arrest key perpetrators were continually thwarted. For example, the time he served the head of the CIA’s human compromise operation, Tippy Richardson. According to pedophile -turned- police-informa nt Ben Rose, in November 1971, Tippy Richardson, businessman Leonard Stewart (from OPEC, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ) and a surgeon named Dr Chesky, raped and murdered three boys aged 14 to 15 years in Ben Rose’s apartment on East 64th Street in New York City. The New York State Select Committee on Crime subsequently served subpoenas on both Tippy Richardson and Leonard Stewart. When served, Tippy Richardson said that because he worked for the CIA the subpoena would be withdrawn under the National Security Act by the time Rothstein and his colleague returned to their offices. That is precisely what occurred. In 1972, Rothstein arrested one of the five Watergate burglars, CIA operative Frank Sturgis. During a subsequent two-hour interrogation, Rothstein discovered the truth about Watergate (plus Sturgis’ and the CIA’s involvement in the Bay of Pigs incident, and the related assassination of JFK). Sturgi s told Rothstein, the Watergate burglars sought something they nicknamed ‘The Book’ which listed the Democrat ic and Republican politicians who accessed child prostitutes, their sexual proclivities, the amounts they paid to rape kids, etc."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 9 The official Wate rgate explanation is that the Liberals broke into Democratic National Committee Headquarters to obtain information about their election strategies. People who lived through Watergate typically comment with a frown, ‘That never made sense.’ Rothstein’s expe riences make better sense of why Nixon conspired to quash the Watergate investigation, why he suggested the investigation posed a threat to national security, why his personal secretary destroyed Oval Office tape recordings after they were subpoenaed, why chief CIA psychologist John W. Gittinger was called to testify at the congressional committee that investigated Watergate , 10 11 and why Nixon’ s own Vice President issued a pardon which protected Nixon from prosecution for any crimes he had ‘committed or may h ave committed or taken part in’ as President. If Nixon’s crimes included pedophilia, that would make perfect sense. I am confident President Richard Nixon and his good buddy ‘the Reverend’ Billy Graham were named in the Watergate pedophile records. I am confident of this because I was sex trafficked by CIA head psychologist John W. Gittinger to both men as a young child. I spoke with James Rothstein on 13 April 2018, 9:48 am and asked him whether he knew, or had heard, that Nixon was a pedophile . ‘No, I did not,’ he quipped with surprise and interest. I next asked him whether he knew about Billy Graham being a pedophile. At this, Rothstein chortled and responded confidently, ‘ Oh, we heard lots about that !’ 10 Judith Well (1988).

It proved popular. ‘Watergate was Pedogate is the best thing I ever read,’ one reader commented. My article caused great controversy, particularly among Southern Baptist Billy Graham worshippers who told me I was the talk of many a Sunday table. Photographs published by Billy’s son Franklin Graham on social media showing him proudly dining on what he described as ‘killer doughnuts’ at Voodoo Doughnuts in Portland added weight to my allegation, that Billy Graham was a multi-generational Luciferian pedophile. Many concluded that Franklin Graham poste d his tweet as a cult threat against me, in direct response to my articles exposing his Freemason father. Conservative Christians found it inappropriate for an evangelical preacher to dine at an establishment that sold doughnuts decorated with encircled pentagrams and which featured Jesus Christ crucified on a penis and testicle shaped doughnut called ‘Cock -N -Balls.’ My articles caused one elderly Baptist to cut the Billy Graham Foundation from her will. Team Aquino The CIA intervened to protect their agent Billy Graham. 12 One of my key perpetrators, US Army Psychological Operations expert Lt. Col. Michael Aquino, weighed in on an orchestrated international effort to discredit me. Another perpetrator, Bond University lecturer Katarina Fritzon, responded to my allegations on official Bond University lette rhead. The written responses of my two perpetrators mirrored each other in their accusation I was a crazy fantasist. Yet people typically ignore crazy fantasists. People respond to someone who is swaying public opinion and who threatens to expose their cult involvement. Only the most desperate and dumb perpetrators respond personally in writing. After this umpteenth attack on my credibility failed, the fool who published both responses subsequently begged social media sharers to delete Luciferian priest Michael Aquino’s email to him, before he disappeared from the internet. Team Aquino’s angle was to focus on whether Rothstein had personally investigated Billy Graham, and they staged a phone interview with the retired detective . I subsequently phoned Rothste in’s home. His wife, who had warmly welcomed Aquino’s lackey, was cold and short with me. I phoned Rothstein’s mobile. ‘How did you get this number?!’ Rothstein asked defensively. It was the same number Aquino’s lackey called him on. ‘It’s plastered all over the internet,’ I responded. ‘You were tricked. A recording of your conversation with Aquino’s lackey is everywhere.’ ‘I thought what you’re doing is admirable,’ he lamented. ‘Can’t you just tell people an old man got it wrong?’ No, I could not. To clarify, Rothstein never told me he personally worked on an investigation into Billy Graham. Rothstein spoke of Billy Graham in the context of having heard about the preacher’s pedophile antics from somewhere within his network of associates whose job i t was to investigate VIP pedophile rings. We never discussed the source of this information, or whether it came from his own NYPD organisation, or from external agencies like the FBI, or 12 New York Times (1967).

Former high-ranking Freemason James Shaw described how 33⁰ Freemason Billy Graham was present at his own 33⁰ initiation ritual. 14 Time magazine reported, 15 the CIA funded Billy Graham’s 1967 Latin American crusade under a CIA cut-out, the US National Student Association , which also financed the National Council of Churches , Harvard Law School, and AFL-CIO affiliates. 16 The New York Times picked up the story. 17 Here is correspondence I received from two more Billy Graham victims: 1. ‘Fiona, I just came across an article you had written about Scalia and it also mentioned Billy Graham. I was born in 1956 in SC, to a ‘church organist’ who was in a SRA cult. I am 62 and was 55 before really detailed abuse memories became clear to me. I worked for a while with a Christian therapist who diagnosed me as having DID and being an SRA survivor. Sometimes I doubted my own memories but he NEVER did, with one exception. He did not believe me when I told him of being taken to a Billy Graham crusade as a small child, perhaps age 6 or 7, and being made to give Graham oral sex. My parents sang in the choir at several of his crusades and his music director, Cliff Barrows... my parents knew them personally... Even after his death, he is one religious leader heavily protected by the media. Anyway, may God bless you for your courage. Please keep exposing evil people... I’m 99 percent sure my abusers were Luciferians. Definitely inv olved some Freemasons one of whom was a Southern Baptist minister.’ 2. ‘I was put through a satanic ritual with Billy Graham when I was 7, hung upside down on a cross, with about ten children and a half circle of men in black robes. I think I called out for Jesus during part of it. He grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me for doing so, screaming at me something like that not even Jesus could help me. That’s one ritual. Just one. Billy Graham must have had so many victims. The man is in hell where he belong s.’ * * * The Rothstein incident is a fine example of the tactics employed by CIA paid social media trolls.

The CIA know that most people do not bother researching facts for themselves. Instead they would come to me and demand an answer to every false accusation, no matter how absurd. The CIA-paid social media trolls will do the same with this book - focus on discrediting my entire 200,000+ words with one stupid point that I do not sufficiently clarify. Aussie Pedo P Ms James Rothstein told me that during his investigations he became aware of an identical child sex trafficking ring in Australia which involved our Prime Ministers. Regarding this matter, Rothstein did clarify that he had not directly investigated the Australian pedophiles himself, but that an Australian intelligence officer named Pe ter Osborne knew the details. Rothstein confirmed that Australian politicians and other VIPs attended international child brothels. In 2015, I reported three former Australian Prime Minister s to the police for their participation in the international pedophile network Rothstein described. In 2019, the daughter of one pedo PM, Paul Keating, was outed for her intimate connection to Jeffrey Epstein’s child traffick ing operation: When privilege becomes a curse: How Katherine Keating used her status as PM’s daughter to befriend royals and infiltrate New York’s high society – and why she has gone into hiding since being linked to Jeffrey Epstein Josh Hanrahan, Daily Mail , 24 Aug 201 9 ... Ms Keating’s involvement with Epstein came courtesy of the connections she has cultivated through her family name. In 2002, at just 20 and while studying arts at the University of New South Wales, she became a member of then NSW Premier Bob Carr’s personal staff. She left that role in mid-2003, but remained an advisor to the NSW Labor government until 2005... Bob Carr and the Australian Labor Party are heavily implicated in the global child trafficking network. In 2010, Katherine Keating was filmed waving at accused pedophile Prince Andrew while leaving Jeffrey Epstein’s New York mansion. This occurred after Epstein’s 2008 sex offender conviction. The 2010 video footage shows a young girl leaving the house with Jeffery Epstein, followed by Katherine Keating waving at Prince Andrew who stands behind Epstein’s front door. In 2014, Katherine Keating interviewed Epstein’s child trafficking partner Ghislaine Maxwell for the Huffington Post . Maxwell is the daughter of a corrupt British politician and media proprietor.

In that role, he discovered that political power does not reside with publicly elected representatives, but with the world’s 8,000 to 8,500 wealthiest individuals who exercise power behind the scenes and who routinely manipulate the media. These elites, Bernard said, sit at the top of a power structure that resembles a pyramid: World Banking Power Structure 8,000 - 8,500 wealthiest individuals Bank for International Settlements (BIS) IMF (International Monetary Fund) + World Bank Central Banks Multinational companies Countries’ governments Ronald Bernard described the Central Banks as ‘illegally created private banks’ which oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries. He said the wealthiest 8,000 to 8,500 people created the BIS in 1930. S ince the world’s richest individuals are too young to have helped establish the BIS 88 years ago, he must mean banking dynasties like the Rothschilds. Dope Inc.

Dutch Origins Ronald Bernard said the financial hierarchy he worked for originated in Holland. The Dope Inc. (1978) authors agree. The British Crown employed the Hofjuden (‘ Court Jews ’) to financially manage their drug operation. These Royal bankers migrated from Amsterdam to Britain after the 1688 Revolution during which Holland’s leader conquered England and was crowned King William III. Previously, the bankers participated in the Dutch East India Company's first opium trade expeditions, collaborated for centuries with the British Jesuits, and participated in the Jesuit Inquisition. The Royal bankers were rewarded with Royal bloodline wives. These bankers, including the Rothschilds, W arburgs, Oppenheimers and Schroeders became Hitler’s main financial backers. The British Royal family are of German descent and changed their family name from German-sounding House of Saxe -Coburg and Gotha to English -sounding House of Windsor in 1917. Their Nazi sympathies were demonstrated in the 1933 film footage of future King Edward VIII te aching the ‘heil Hitler’ arm salute to young Queen Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, and their mother. In October 1937, abdicated Edward visited Nazi Germany where he met Hitler, dined with Hitler’s deputy, Rudolf Hess, and toured a concentration camp. The Royal bankers coordinated the laundering of drug money via offshore unregulated banks including Britain’s island colonies. Hong Kong was established as the centre of the global drug trade. The British Crown created the P&O shipping line specifically to transport the drugs, plus the HSBC bank to launder the opium proceeds. A portion of the drug money was laundered via ‘legitimate’ cash businesses like hotels, restaurants, gambling establishments, while some was channelled into blood diamonds, gold and art."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 15 The Royal Family created P&O to traffic drugs + HSBC to launder drug money . The Hofjuden sponsored select families to run the criminal underworld and its front organizations. These families committed crimes of trafficking, extortion and murder. The Bronfman Rothschild finance company is a prime example of this arrangement. The Canadian heirs to the Seagram liquor company were originally known as the ‘Bronfman Gang.’ They made their initial fortune boot-le gging alcohol and operating prostitution brothels during prohibition, followed by trafficking cocaine and heroin. Nothing has Changed Dope Inc . (1978) named prominent families involved in the drug trade , including the Astor, Bundy, DuPont, Freeman, Kennedy, Li, Rockefeller, Rothschild, and Russell dynasties. Fritz Springmeier added Bronfman, Cabot, Shaw, Bacon, Perkins, and Morgan to the list. He said all of these were Luciferian bloodlines. The same families are still trafficking drugs and children, as recent events indicate: - In April 2019, Seagram heiress Clare Bronfman pleaded guilty to her role in a sex trafficking operation called NXVIM. Her sister and co-financer Sara Bronfman was implicated but avoided charges. - In June 2019, US officials seized a cargo ship owned by J.P. Morgan Chase which was trafficking 20 tons of cocaine worth $1.3 billion. NXIVM is MK-ULTRA In the late 1990s, Amway salesman Keith Raniere and Nancy Salzman founded NXIVM. Raniere , who attended a Luciferian Rudolph Steiner school, modelled NXIVM on Scientology. Salzman was trained in NLP (neurolinguistic programming) by Richard Bandler (MK -ULTRA perpetrator), and in hypnosis by Herbert Spiegel (US Army hypnotist, and MK-ULTRA researcher at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, who wrote the foreword to the MK-ULTRA classic, The Control of Candy Jones ). The Bronfman sisters financed NXIVM and its subsidiaries including the non-profit Ethical Science Foundation which came under state Attorney General investigation in 2017 for performing brain-activity and other human behavioural studies. Medical doctor Brandon B. Porter conducted MK -ULTRA style ‘Human Fright Experiments’ in which he hooked over 100 victims to an EEG and recorded their reaction to surprise screenings of snuff films : ...an actual video of the horrific and brutal murders and dismemberment of four women by machetes; and violent film clips, including a male African American being viciously stomped by a Nazi; a conscious male being forced to eat a portion of his own brain matter; and a graphic gang rape. 21 21 Melissa Klein & Isabel Vincent (2018).

They caved to pressure following the high profile NXIVM case. Back in 2013, Keith Raniere patented a device designed to measure victims’ sensory responses to watching snuff films . He labelled this, ‘ Determination of whether a Luciferian can be rehabilitated .’ Women who were not overtly traumatised by the images were considered suitable recruits and physically branded like cattle. Their numbness at watching snuff films indicated their passivity to, and suitability for, sex traffick ing. The mainstream media ignored the cr ux of the story, that NXVIM was a front for CIA child sex trafficking. NXVIM leader Raniere and his sidekick Allison Mack were originally charged with child sex trafficking . I n 2019 the couple were additionally charged with child pornography. The pending counts filed on 19 April 2018 and published on the internet read: 1. Sex trafficking of children by force, fraud, or coercion. 2. Conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of children by force, fraud, or coercion. 3. Attempt to establish peonage, slavery, involuntary servitude, human trafficking. Adding weight to NXVIM posing as a ‘legitimate’ front organisation for child trafficking, Clare Bronfman sponsored a NXVIM subsidiary called Rainbow Cultural Garden which operated numerous international childcare centres located in the USA, UK, Ireland, Guatemala, Spain and Mexico. Bronfman also purchased an island in Fiji, a notorious child trafficking hub. The NXVIM court case revealed the Mexican government, including the ir President, were involved in the operation, vindicating my five-month 2018 online campaign to expose the Arizona/Mexican border as the main human trafficking land route involving Tuscon Mayor Jonathan Rothschild, his senior police staff who were previously implicated in child trafficking in California, and a minion of NSA / FBI informants with Luciferian cult connections. Isaac Kappy who helped me expose this operation subsequently died under suspicious circumstances in Arizona near an NSA base immediately after he reached out for help to the Clinton/DynCorp/ CIA-linked trained assassin who hid the discovery of child trafficking camps in the Tuscon desert. NXIVM bore the hallmarks of a CIA human trafficking and compromise operation. The cult sex trafficked children and adults, targeted influential people including entertainers, and owned over 60 related companies including a video department called Moving Pixels . Connections were detected between NXIVM and human trafficking mob bosses Bill and Hillary Clinton: - Texts exist between Keith Raniere and Hillary Clinton. - In the 1990s, Bill Clinton asked Keith Raniere for money because he was doing business in Arkansas. When Raniere refused, the state Attorney General targeted his operation for closure. Consequently, Raniere’ s new NXIVM operation made illegal campaign contributions to the Clintons. This information was revealed during Mark Vincente’s testimony during the NXVIM trial (12 May 2019).

Intelligence agencies like the CIA, MI6 and Mossad do not serve and protect a people or country as the public expect, he explained, but are all criminal organizations that trade in drugs, weapons, and children. The CIA functions as a private police force for the elite. According to Bernard, the wealthy elite control their employees through compromise and blackmail – just as James Rothstein described. Ronald Bernard described how he and the other bankers employed by the wealthy elite were expected to participate in heinous sexual and murderous acts including the ritual sacrifice of children.

Howie Rubin, 62, whose high -stakes dealing was featured in the best-selling books ‘Liar’s Poker’ and ‘The Big Short,’ rented the lavish Metropolitan Tower pad in Midtown to indulge in brutal sex with women whom he paid between $2,000 and $5,000 per session, according to the suit filed Thursday. The three unidentified plaintiffs in the case — including two Playboy Playmates — claim the married father raped and beat them to the point that they needed extensive medical attention, court papers say. At the $8 million penthouse, they were shown to a side room featuring ropes, chains and sex toys along with other BDSM equipment .

Further, the 1978 book inspired law enforcement officials to swap their assumption that drug trafficking consisted of pockets of independent criminal activity, for understanding the drug industry as a global network coordinated by the CIA, with proceeds laundered through banks and funnelled into the CIA’s covert terrorist operations. All intelligence agencies are privately owned criminal organizations. Dope Inc. and Ronald Bernard’s testimony are consistent with the 1972 Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal and the findings of reporter Danny Casalaro who was ‘suicided’ while investigating the same secret syndicate. The Manhattan District Attorney who closed BCCI ’s USA branch announced that 16 witnesses died while investigating the BCCI’s involvement in covert CIA operations, arms smuggling to Iraq, money laundering, and child prostitution. Danny Casalaro labelled the system The Octopus and described it as follows: They’re not government officials but their tentacles can reach into any part of the government in almost any country including legitimate a nd rogue spy networks. They are not notable industrialists, but they can pull the strings of the oil and banking empires at will. They are not known criminals, but they successfully penetrated all factions of organized crime including the Mafia, the Japane se Yakuza, the secret Chinese Triads, and the terrorist underground. 22 Casalaro linked The Octopus to people, places, and activities consistent with my experience. His notes and phone records referenced drug trafficking, money laundering, Mossad, CIA, shellfish-based bioweapons, genetic engineering, Nicaragua, Watergate, Australia’s Nugan-Hand Bank, Pi ne Gap, MJ-12, and Area 51. 23 This bizarre combination of diverse and seemingly unrelated research topics only make s sense within the context of witness testimonies like mine.

Operation Mockingbird : In 1977, Watergate investigative journalist Carl Bernstein said the CIA had recruited over 400 American journalists: Alsop is one of more than 400 American journalists who in the past twenty - five years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents on file at CIA headquarters. Some of these journalists’ relationships with the Agency were tacit; some were explicit. There was cooperation, accommodation and overlap. Journalists provided a full range of cland estine services—from simple intelligence gathering to serving as go - betweens with spies in Communist countries. Reporters shared their notebooks with the CIA. Editors shared their staffs. Some of the journalists were Pulitzer Prize winners, distinguished r eporters who considered themselves ambassadors without - portfolio for their country. Most were less exalted: foreign correspondents who found that their association with the Agency helped their work; stringers and freelancers who were as interested in the d erring - do of the spy business as in filing articles; and, the smallest category, full - time CIA employees masquerading as journalists abroad. In many instances, CIA documents show, journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of th e managements of America’s leading news organizations. 24 This CIA operation was called Mockingbird . Australia and the UK have their own network of Mockingbird journalists which sprung to the defence of Westminster VIP pedophiles. PIE I received the following correspondence, in 2017: In 1971 an Adelaide barrister from the Communist Party of Australia created the precursor to what later became the Pedophile Information Exchange. This lawyer was the late ELLIOT JOHNSON. The Pedophile Information Exchange was formed from earlier pedophile groups such as the Lewis Carroll Collectors Guild and the (homosexual) Peter Pan Club. Another founder of this organization (from the Peter Pan Club) was FRANK HOUSTON who also founded the pseudo-church The Assembly of God. Houston was pastor of the Surre y Hills Christian Centre which later morphed into Hillsong Church. Houston was an organizer for the Peter Pan Club when he was contacted by Elliot Johnson and asked to assist in forming a ‘united front’ for organized pedophilia.

It was later estimated that Osborne had been involved with more than 2500 under -aged males over a 20-year period... Incredibly, Osborne and his voluminous files were never thoroughly investigated by police. According to officers who viewed the Osborne material at the time, the names on the index cards, so dutifully recorded by Osborne, were not only those of the boys he had seduced, but adults – members of the judiciary, the legal profession, politicians, academics, and even police officers – with sexual interests in children. One former officer said the Osborne material was enough ‘to bring down the [then Queensland] government overnight.’ 39 Osborn shared his pedophile materials with Australia’s leading criminologist and ABC Radio regular Paul Wilson who wrote a book defending Clarence Osborne . 40 At the University of Queensland during the 1980s, Paul Wilson organised a pro-pedophilia conference and showed a child porn snuff film to his psychology class. Bond University published Paul Wilson’s pro-pedophile articles on their website , until Wilson was charged with historical child sexual assault. By the early 1980s the Osborne case had been all but forgotten, and many of the diminutive stenographer’s secrets were presumed lost with him. Except a retired Queensland police officer with a conscience and a phenomenal memory, who wanted to pursue Osborne at the time – and was warned off by senior officers, and who received a death threat after he pushed the pedophile investigation too far – only to be drummed out of the force, never forgot the case. And in breaking his silence, he would link Osborne to an international pedophile ring, and the child abuse scandal currently rocking Westminster in the UK. 41 UK’s Jeffrey Epstein: Jimmy Savile OBE Jimmy Savile, who associated closely with British prime ministers Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher , and the British Royal family, was linked to PIE.

The perverted star wore a hooded robe and mask as he abused the terrified victim in a candle -lit basement. He also chanted ‘Hail Satan’ in Latin as other paedophile devil worshippers joined in and assaulted the girl at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire. The attack, which happened in 1975, shines a sinister new light on the former DJ’s 54-year reign of terror. Savile, who died aged 84 in October 2011, is now Britain’s worst sex offender after police revealed he preyed on at least 450 victims aged eight to 47. The girl kept her torment hidden for nearly 20 years before finally opening up to therapist Valerie Sinason. Dr Sinason told the Sunday Express she first spoke to the victim in 1992. ‘She had been a patient at Stoke Mandeville in 1975 when Savile was a regular visitor. She recalled being led into a room that was filled with candles on the lowest level of the hospital, somewhere that was not regularly used by staff. Several adults were there, including Jimmy Savile who, like the others, was wearing a robe and a mask . She recognised him because of his distinctive voice and the fact that his blond hair was protruding from the side of the mask. He was not the leader but he was seen as important because of his fame. She was molested, raped and beaten an d heard words that sounded like ‘Ave Satanas,’ a Latin-ised version of ‘Hail Satan, ’ being chanted . There was no mention of any other child being there and she cannot remember how long the attack lasted but she was left extremely frightened and shaken.’ Savile was a volunteer porter and fundraiser at the hospital between 1965 and 1988 and had his own quarters there . Five years after the hospital attack, he abused a second victim during another black mass ceremony held at a house in a wealthy London street. The woman was 21 at the time and was made to attend an orgy, which later took on a darker twist . Dr Sinason, director of the Clinic for Dissociative Studies in London, said: ‘A second victim approached me in 1993. She said she had been ‘lent out’ as a supposedly consenting prostituted woman at a party in a London house in 1980. The first part of the evening started off with an orgy but half -way through some of the participants left. Along with other young women, the victim was shepherded to wait in another room before being brought back to find Savile in a master of ceremonies kind of role with a group wearing robes and masks. She too heard Latin chanting and instantly recognised Satanist regalia. Although the girl was a young adult, who was above the age of consent, she had suffered a history of sexual abuse and was extremely vulnerable.’ Both victims contacted Dr Sinason, who is president of the Institute of Psychotherapy and Disability, while she was involved in a Department of Health -funded study into sexual abuse committed during rituals and religious ceremonies.

Whether Savile was a practising Satanist or merely enjoyed dressing up to scare his victims even more will perh aps never be known but he left those two girls mentally scarred.’ Dr Sinason has passed details of the abuse to officers from the Savile inquiry, Operation Yewtree... * * * SCANDAL OF JIMMY SAVILLE’S 50 YEARS OF SEX ABUSE John Twomey & Mark Reynolds, Express.co.uk , 12 Jan 2013. THE vast scale of Jimmy Savile’s sexual abuse was revealed yesterday as the BBC star was unmasked as a monster who raped and molested children for nearly six decades. Former Top Of The Pops presente r Savile preyed on at least 450 victims at schools, hospitals and at other venues including a hospice and the BBC TV Centre. Using his celebrity status and the popularity of shows such as Jim’ll Fix It, the paedophile gained access to victims and committed horrific crimes at will, a report revealed yesterday. Savile hoodwinked his bosses, hospital and school officials and millions of viewers and listeners to gain almost saint -like status. Commander Peter Spindler, who led Scotland Yard’s £450,000 inquiry, s aid: ‘He groomed the nation.’ Detectives believe Savile spent every waking moment thinking of ways to gain access to victims. He also attacked vulnerable adults but 73 per cent of his victims were under 18. The youngest was an eight-year -old boy. He also abused a dying child at Great Ormond Street Hospital. The child, aged 11 or 12, told relatives Savile had touched him or her inappropriately. The DJ committed at least 34 rapes – mostly on women. Some victims were hospital patients who had pleaded with him to visit because they had no one else. Victims were attacked in 14 different medical establishments including mental health units. His sickening activities were exposed in a landmark joint report by the Metropolitan Police and the children’s charity NSPCC. His earliest recorded offence was in 1955 and the latest in 2009, when he was 82. He died in 2011. Police recorded 214 crimes across 28 forces from Avon and Somerset to Northumbria. The peak of the offending was from 1966 to 1976. Scarcely any victims complained.

Savile and Mountbatten are linked to the investigation of Kincora Boys’ Home in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Joseph Mains, the Warden of Kincora Boys’ Home, prostituted boys to British VIPs. He drove Kincora boys to Classiebawn Castle on Mullaghmore Harbor in County Sligo, on Ireland’s West Coast, for Lord Mountbatten to rape. Mountbatten holidayed at Classiebawn Castle every summer for 30 years – until the Irish Republican Army assassinated him in 1979 by bombing his boat in Mullahgmore Harbour. Rumours persist that the IRA kill ed Mountbatten because he took advantage of Northern Irish boys. Consistent with their VIP child trafficking coverup, the British press completely ignored this Saville -Mountbatten-Kincora connection when reporting on the August 2019 launch of Andrew Lownie’s sensational biography, The Mountbattens: their Lives & Loves .

The intelligence files describe the 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma and his wife Edwina as ‘persons of extremely low morals’ who frequently had extramarital affairs. One source said Mountbatten’s penchant for young men made him ‘an unfit man to direct any sort of military operations.’ ... The 75 -year-old FBI documents were obtained through a freedom of information request by British historian Andrew Lownie, who has written a biography of the couple. In the book, The Mountbattens: their Lives & Loves, Mountbatten’s former driver Ron Perks reveals that one of his boss’s favourite destinati ons was ‘an upmarket gay brothel used by senior naval officers’ called the Red House near Rabat. Agents began compiling the file, which spans more than three decades, in February 1944, shortly after Mountbatten became supreme allied commander of southeas t Asia. Following his appointment, the FBI interviewed Elizabeth de la Poer Beresford, Baroness Decies, about another matter, and she brought up Mountbatten. The file reads: ‘She states that in these circles Lord Louis Mountbatten and his wife are considered persons of extremely low morals. She stated that Lord Louis Mountbatten was known to be a homosexual with a perversion for young boys. In Lady Decies’ opinion he is an unfit man to direct any sort of military operations because of this condition. She stated further that his wife Lady Mountbatten was considered equally erratic.’ It was signed EE Conroy, head of the New York field office, who wrote that she ‘appears to have no special motive in making the above statements .’ ... Rumours about Mountbatten’s se xuality have long swirled following his death 40 years ago... fuelled by his comment: ‘Edwina and I spent all our married lives getting into other people’s beds.’ The royal kept a large group of gay friends, including Noël Coward, Terence Rattigan, Ivor Nove llo and Tom Driberg, who reportedly referred to him as ‘Mountbottom’. Lownie’s new book, to be published on Thursday, contains an interview with Anthony Daly, a rent boy to the rich and famous during the 1970s. Daly claims: ‘Tom said Mountbatten had something of a fetish for uniforms — handsome young men in military uniforms (with high boots) and beautiful boys in school uniform.’ * * * By contrast, Irish news sites focussed on Andrew Lownie’s coverage of the Saville - Mountbatten-Kincora connection.

Pro-pedo mouthpiece The Telegraph led the propaganda charge with quotes like : ‘Satanic ritual abuse does not exist, it’s like alien abduction.’ 42 The quoted female barrister advocated for lowering the age of consent to 13, and not charging pedophiles with historical crimes because it was ‘too late .’ She employed the term ‘moral panic’ to dismiss victim testimony. Quoting a female pedophile defender is effective because the public do not realise how many females, including barristers, are involved in Luciferian pedophile cults. The ‘plain vanilla’ account pushed by UK media involved 13 police stations which gathered reports from 589 victims, 450 of whom claimed abuse by Savile . The abuse implicated the BBC plus 32 government hospitals. A 2014 N ational Health Service report concluded , Savile raped public hospital patients over several decades, including children, adults, and dead bodies, with the knowledge and support of government authorities. Nurses felt so helpless to stop Savile, they warned hospitalised children to feign sleep to avoid Savile raping them during his late -night ward rounds. Savile even assaulted hospital staff and visitors. Further, politicians and civil servants appointed unqualified Jimmy Savile to run Broadmoor psychiatric unit where he boldly assaulted staff, raped patients, and invited high profile associates to watch women shower. To date , the British Government has failed to explain how one filthy grub wielded such influence and te rror without the backing of Westminster pedophile s. Jimmy Savile was implicated in the abuse of children at tax/pedophile haven Jersey Island 43 where residents’ front yards proudly display statues of very young children performing oral sex on erect penises, plus a 12-foot statue of Satan as pedophile Pan. The entire Jersey Island population including police, judiciary, social services and journalists were complicit to the ritual rape, torture and murder of children at the island’s children’s home, Hart de la Garenne, where police found buried remains of multiple children, plus a kill room featuring: shackles, a blood-stained concrete tub, lime bath, and incinerator full of children’s dismembered body parts. Senior police, including Scotland Yard, bloc ked investigations of most of the 151 perpetrators identified by 192 victims who made 1,776 witness statements. A few low -level staff were charged, while all VIPs and those accused of satanic ritual abuse, escaped police investigation. Anyone who tried to expose the Luciferian pedophile child trafficking operation were arrested or murdered, including Dyana, sister of Bill Maloney who produced the documentary Sun, Sea and Satan about the ritual abuse the siblings experienced on Jersey Island. 42 Melanie Hall (2013).

The Dutroux Affair In the 1990s, Catholic Belgium became notorious for the Dutroux Affair , a 1990s child sex trafficking scandal implicating Belgian Royals, politicians, bankers, businessmen, police and lawyers. WikiLeaks dropped a ‘ Dutroux dossier’ showing clientele from European countries, plus Morocco and Saudi Arabia, paid to rape trafficked Belgian children. Belgian victim Regina Louf said VIP clientele were secretly filmed without the ir knowledge as part of a human compromise operation, ‘It was big business - blackmail - there was a lot of money involved.’ 45 Belgian girls were kidnapped, caged, gang raped in pedophile orgies, and murdered for snuff films ; t hey were tortured, ritually sacrificed, suffocating to death in holding cells, wrapped in plastic and buried alive, and killed for sexual pleasure. Regina Louf was sold to the Belgian trafficking network by her wealthy grandmother, Cecile Beernaert, whose WW2 brothels serviced Nazi troops. Regina described being raped at sex orgies organised by businessman Jean Michel Nihoul who was later convicted of trafficking drugs and people into Belgium . Regina Louf and other Dutroux victims told police they were subjected to satanic ritual abuse and child hunts in which VIPs including Belgium Royalty hunted and murdered children for sport in locations including the grounds of Chimay Castle .

Belgian fire fighters protested by turning their hoses on the Belgian Parliamentary building. One third of Belgians surnamed Dutroux legally changed their family name. Yet this all this achieved nothing. Belgian sex trafficking victim Anneke Lucas came forward in 2017 in the wake of Pedogate . Anneke’s mother sold her into sex slavery at age six years.

UK Prosecutes ‘Fantasist’ Victims for Whistleblowing The UK’s latest tactic to silence victims of government child trafficking is to prosecute them for reporting the crimes committed against them to the police. Their modus operandi involves the DPP charg ing victims with perverting the course of justice, while the government - controlled media slander the victims as a ‘fantasists’ who fabricates witness testimony for money. The UK government tried this on Ben Fellows, a former UK child actor and Westminster sex trafficking victim. Ben Fellows said his agent Sylvia Young solicited him at age 14 years for sexual abuse by Tom Cruise. Fellows was subsequently targeted for false arrest and slander by the media who described the victim as ‘an inventive and sometimes persuasive fantasist.’ In 2015, the UK government unsuccessfully prosecuted Ben Fellows for perverting the course of justice for prov iding a 2012 police witness statement to Operation Fairbank . 52 Multiple victims who came forward and made police witness statements against elite UK pedophiles including Edward Heath were initially supported as ‘credible and true .’ In 2016, Westminster victim Darren Thornham used Twitter to warn of a coverup operation involving (a) a fake victim being planted to discredit the genuine ones, and (b) a cut -out media company ( Exaro News ) gathering testimonies from victims who were subsequently falsely arrested and murder ed.

The inquiry ended in 1970 when prosecutors falsely concluded they had insufficient evidence to prosecute Cyril Smith. MI5 knew the DPP lied to journalists about their decision not to charge Cyril Smith, but did nothing. 55 In Smile for the Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith (2014) Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk claimed Cyril Smith was allowed to continue abusing children as young as eight, after 144 victims’ complaints were submitted to authorities. This is not the extent of investigations into Westminster VIPs and UK children homes being used as VIP brothels. I will mention one more high -profile case, due to its international trafficking relevance : NAMBLA & Arthur C. Clarke British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke co-wrote the screenplay for the 1968 predictive programming film, 2001: A Space Odyssey . In 1961, Julian Huxley’s UNESCO awarded Clarke the Kalinga Prize for popularising science. Clarke is famously quoted as saying, ‘Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.’ More significantly, Arthur C. Clarke was a gay pedophile who pioneered the Sri Lankan child sex tourism industry. The British Royal s knighted Clarke just days after Sunday Mirror journalist Graham Johnson revealed Clarke admitted to having solicited young boys for sex . When Clarke subsequently denied this admission, the Sunday Mirror produced Clarke’s taped admission plus a secret document naming Clarke as a pedophile known to members of the NAMBLA ( North American Boy Lovers Association ) pedophile network. US detectives, who arrested leaders of the [NAMBLA] association 10 years ago, say Clarke was named by other pedophiles they quizzed during an FBI investigation. The perverts had set up children's homes in Thailand as fronts for their sick activities. One of its leaders was Jonathan Tampico, 48, a top nuclear scientist who worked for the American Government . He served two-and-a- half years in jail for molesting a boy of 12 and is now on the run with a million-dollar warrant on his head for further porn offences. He told detectives he had stayed at Clarke's home in Colombo and had swapped letters with the author. Another known pedophile, former church minister John Wakefield Cummings, 56, is serving a 24-years-to-life sentence after admitting molesting 17 boys in his care. He told police in Sacremento, California, that Clarke had been contacted at his Sri Lankan home by a pedophile who was on the run from the American authorities. In a sworn statement made to an investigator for Sacremento's district attorney...Wakefield Cummings told how the pervert fled to Sri Lanka where he was able to contact the pedophile community through Clarke. He then fled from Sri 54 Rajeev Syal (2019). Lord Steel says he believed Cyril Smith abuse claims but did not act . The Guardian [Online], 14 March. 55 Frances Perraudin (2017).

Detectives contacted a child welfare group to warn them about Clarke's activities. 56 Arthur C. Clarke said in the notorious interview: ‘I am all in favour of efforts to stop [pedophilia]. But how do we stop it without interfering with the rights of responsible adults. I think most of the damage comes from the fuss made by hysterical parents afterwards. If the kids don't mind, fair enough.’ In recent years Clarke's name has been linked with two notorious pedophiles, one of whom - a Swiss millionaire - was kicked out of Sri Lanka on the orders of the president for abusing impoverished beach boys. He is now awaiting trial in Zurich accused of sexually abusing up to 1,500 young boys and like Clarke was friends with a lot of Sri Lanka's top politicians, senior policemen and influential government figures . Clarke is said to have attended parties at the tycoon's home. When asked if he had, Clarke replied: ‘I may well have done. I mean the very first man I met here in 1954 was a pedophile and made no bones about it. He was in intelligence in the army , a fantastic guy.’ 57 Media mogul Rupert Murdoch stopped his UK newspaper News of the World from breaking the story that Arthur C. Clarke was a pedophile - because he was friends with the pedophile . 58 Coverup Tactics The UK government employed dirty tactics to cover -up the Westminster pedophile story. Similar tactics were implemented in Belgium, Australia and the USA: 1. Label outspoken victims as liars, fantasists, and/or insane. 2. Frame victims with false arrest for fabricated crimes. 3. Label concern about, and investigation of, pedophilia and ritual abuse crimes ‘ Moral Panic’ or ‘ Satanic Panic.’ 4. Label all inquiry into adult male pedophiles with a penchant for boys, ‘homophobia’ and an ‘ abuse of human rights.’ The gay community must be proactive in distancing themselves from pedophiles who long ago equated the fight for gay rights with the fight for social and legal acceptance of pedophilia. Being gay does not automatically make a person a pedophile. Yet many equate being gay with being a pedophile , thanks to PIE and NAMBLA members who aligned themselves with gay activist groups in the 1970s and ‘80s. NAMBLA participated in gay pride marches.

Note that PIE and NAMBLA never disbanded, they simply dove underground and employed more subtle ways of achieving the ir perceived right to rape children . Aussie Banks: CIA Money Launderers As I write, Australia is in the process of two federal investigations, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse , and the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry . Only one of these investigations has shed any light on the global child trafficking network. On 5 April 2018, Nicole Rose, the newly appointed head of AUSTRAC ( Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre ) addressed the Australian media: 59 I thought coming from the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission that I had a pretty good handle on serious and organised crime side. I didn't appreciate the depth and breadth of involvement with private entities and banks. I didn't appreciate how many industries it does actually touch. There's a misperception that money laundering is a victimless white -collar crime that's probably just looking at tax avoidance - and it’s not. It is criminal entities using financial institutions here and nationally to move criminal funds around our country and our financial system overseas . A nd it has a massive impact on everyday life. Whether that's child exploitation , serious and organised crime, drug importation - it all involves money laundering. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) was subsequently fined $700 million for almost 54,000 breaches of anti -money laundering and counterterrorism financing laws, including the laundering of proceeds from child sex trafficking, and the channelling of these funds into overseas terrorist organisations. This massive criminal operation involved 27 different groups or cells, each of which accessed a CBA account. Each of the 27 accounts was used for money laundering by multiple, possibly hundreds, of criminals, with each individual deposit ing amounts of over $10,000 into the automatic tellers per sitting. Police obtained footage of people sitting at tellers at night with large bags of cash, patiently feeding notes into the IDMs (Intelligent Deposit Machines). About 80 percent of CBA-laundered money was obtained via drug trafficking, while the remaining 20 percent came from child sex trafficking (namely by Fijian nationals operating in far north Queensland). The CBA sting operation incorporated the biggest illicit drug bust in Australian history. This massive Perth, WA drug bust went unreported in the Australian media. And t hat is not all the government covered up. AUSTRAC cut short the ir investigation and 59 Peter Ryan (2018).

The most telling cover -up regarding the CBA case is that, while the CBA as an organisation was fined, law enforcement authorities never prosecuted the individual CBA employees identified as responsible for masterminding the laundering operation. Those offenders simply left the CBA to assume senior executive positions within other organisations. Police prosecutors claimed they had insufficient evidence to prosecute the executives, when they in fact possessed ample evidence. I suggest the true reason the DPP did not pursue the individuals responsible for these crimes is because the perp etrators were CIA agents, and the CBA money laundering operation was part of the CIA-coordinated global child and drug trafficking operation. As I write, Westpac and the NAB ( National Australia Bank) are under AUSTRAC investigation for the very same crimes. ASIO, ANSTO & the Redress Scheme In 2018, the Australian government initiated a Redress Scheme where child abuse victims could apply for a maximum $150k compensation for being abused at the hands of one or more government and/or private institutions named as perpetrators to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse . The Redress Scheme prevents victims from taking further action against the institutions. It is the responsibility of individual institutions to submit to the Redress Scheme. For instance, the Roman Catholic Church dioceses signed up, but the individual Catholic Orders including the Salesian Priests who operated BoysTown did not. Signing up is basically an admission of guilt on the institution’s part and indicates that victims reported that institution to the Child Abuse Royal Commission. Scrolling through the list of institutions who signed up to the redress scheme, my therapist and I were shocked to read the names ASIO and ANSTO. Babylon Will Fall ‘Babylon’ is the Biblical name of the ‘great city that rules over the kings of the world’ (Rev. 17:18). Babylon was and is a global political, financial and religious power system that rules the world. It is the Black Network , the Octopus , the Illuminati , the Luciferian Order headed by the Rothschild dynasty, administered by pedophile government officials, and policed by the CIA, Mossad, ASIO and MI6. The Bible describes Babylon as follows: - The kings of the world have committed adultery with Babylon. (Rev 18:3) - The merchants of the world have grown rich because of Babylon’s desire for extravagant luxury. (18:3) - Babylon brewed a cup of terror for others. (18:6) - Babylon bought great quantities of human slaves . (18:11) - The merchants of the world became wealthy by selling human slaves to Babylon. (18:15) - Babylon’s merchants are the greatest in the world. (18:23) - Babylon deceived the nations with her sorceries .

The destruction of Babylon and her Luciferian pedophile associates will be quick and complete. My existence and endurance testify to this fact. * * *"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 41 Royal Whitewash Ye shall know them by their fruit. (Matt 7:16) The Catalyst My private session with the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse was scheduled for 3pm, 26 June 2013 at an inner Brisbane City hotel. My husband and I sat waiting in a hotel room when a young lawyer rushed in to greet us. Her arms cradled the 22-page written complaint I electronically submitted to the Commission, and r emarked: ‘You’re obviously highly educated!’ ‘No,’ I corrected her. ‘I’m highly intelligent. I received an abysmal education. I taught myself everything I know.’ The lawyer led us into an adjacent hotel room where two commissioners stood to greet us. Fede ral court judge Jennifer Coate sat opposite me at a large round table. Child psychiatrist Helen Milroy sat to my right. The young female lawyer took her seat to my left. Judge Coate presided over our meeting. She began, ‘We’ve read your comprehensive submi ssion. It’s good that you submitted this beforehand otherwise we would be spending the entire hearing relaying its contents. We gained the impression that your submission contains a selection of what you experienced and that you know a lot more.’ ‘Yes,’ I agreed. ’There’s much more. I selected the incidents where I could best identify a time, date and place. I also compiled this -...’ With two hands, I purposefully placed a fat, well-organised folder on the table.’ It contains some evidence to back up my complaint. Sorry about the hand-written contents page. I would normally type and reference everything better than this, but I only had a few days’ notice that I would be attending today.’ The Australian public was given the impression that private sessions were a positive, cathartic experience where victims got to share their abuse in a supportive, non -judgemental environment. My experience was different to that. The next two hours felt more akin to a cross examination. It seemed Judge Coate was looking for holes in my testimony. ‘That’s good!’ retired Tweed Heads Detective Frank Natoli exclaimed. ’It means they took you seriously. They were seeing how you’d hold up under cross examination.’ He concluded, ‘This Royal Commission is giving victims a false sense of hope. They won’t investigate their complaints.’ Detective Natoli was right. The first thing Judge Coate told me was, ‘Fiona, we’re not here to redress current victims’ complaints. We’re here to do something for future victims.’ But current victims ARE the future! I thought. This is nothing but a collect -and-contain operation . A wave of determination washed over my being. I asked, ‘What do you plan to do differently to avoid the pitfalls of the last child abuse royal commission?’ Judge Coate was taken aback. ’We’re just at the information gathering stage. We haven’t yet decided what we’re going to do next.’ ‘I imagine you’re overwhelmed at the response so far.’ The three women collectively sighed. We spent the next two hours exploring three separate but related matters: 1. How the NSW Education Department and NSW Police conspired to bury a pedophile ring operating within my local Tweed Shire. 2. My experiences as a victim of an international child sex trafficking ring."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 42 3. How dirty police, Australia’s Psychology Board, and Bond University conspired to simultaneously frame me as (a) an adult perpetrator instead of a child victim of my abuse (in which case my child abuse claims were true ), and (b) psychotic because I said I was abused as a child (in which case my child abuse did not occur). ‘You’re obviously not psychotic,’ Professor Milroy observed . ‘Fiona, your submission was impressive and unique. What you wrote about Elizabeth Loftus and false memory syndrome: we weren’t aware of any of that beforehand.’ I reiterated the scientific invalidation of Loftus’ pro-pedophile writings that formed the basis of the previous Royal Commission’s dismissal of witness testimonies like mine. ‘God help me if I see Elizabeth Loftus in your report!’ I warned. ‘You need to stop universities teaching this rubbish. You need to stop health practitioners automatically labelling child abuse victims borderline personality disordered. That condition is often just a symptom of child abuse and it’s - . . .’ ‘Recoverable?’ Milroy offered. ‘Y-yes,’ I stared at her like a stunned mullet. ‘ The symptoms dissipate as the victim recovers her memories. ’ I remounted my soapbox, ‘You need to stop the latest tactic being used against child abuse victims. They’re using a study which claims that child abuse victims are more likely to become perpetrators, as grounds for accusing victims of being perpetrators. They’ve already tried to frame me as a perpetrator based on being a victim – so you’d better nip that one in the bud!’ My right hemisphere rapidly scanned and analysed the words, body language, eye appearance and micro facial expressions of the three pane l members, and drew its conclusion: Milroy – empathic, intelligent, genuine, eye single, trustworthy . So, when the hotel room turned a fuzzy white and voices became like a faint echo in a dark cave, I turned to Milroy, stared into her red teary eyes and confessed: ‘I’m dissociating.’ Hold it together , I told myself. You are here to give the children a voice . I continued, ‘Detective Bob Sullivan of the NSW child protection squad told me in 2005 that only a Royal Commission had the power to investigate the Tweed Shire pedophile ring. Well, we have a Royal Commission – so let’s investigate!’ Silence. ‘Are you going to investigate my complaints?’ I persisted. Judge Coate ignored me. I seized the commissioner’s eye and demanded: ‘Yes or no! Do you have the power and authority to investigate my complaints?’ The commissioner squared her body to mine, smiled bemusedly and coolly responded, ‘Yes.’ ‘Right! That’s one point. Secondly, is it within your terms of reference to make recommendations based on your investigations?’ ‘Yes,’ she responded just as smoothly. ‘Right!’ I ran my finger across their collective presence and warned, ‘I’m holding you to that. Investigate my complaints!’ I shuffled through my folder of evidence and pulled out a document. ’I’ve included a newspaper article about my university lecturer who was recently charged with sexually assaulting two children. Bond U niversity published his pro-pedophile writings on their website . It says here: "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 43 In his book Life of Crime, 60 Professor Wilson said that in the ‘sizeable majority of incidents’ adolescents were sexually provocative. ‘My findings were remarkably similar to studies in California and Scandinavia which suggest child victims of adult sex offenders are generally willin g or active participants, and that they not infrequently initiate the sexual relationship,’ he wrote. The Commissioners gasped. ‘This is what students are being taught in our universities?’ I raised my voice. ’It’s not acceptable!’ My heart beat faster as I pulled out another document. ‘ This is an email sent to me from Tor Neilsen saying he witnessed sixty children raped in the very same location where I witnessed the same people committing similar crimes! Tor and I independently reported our experiences t o the police!’ My frustration peaked as I turned to another section of my folder and tore out an illustration of the Order of the Eagle ritual banner. ’Look!’ I thrust it at them. ’Look at this! I am the first person in the world to come forward and publish this! This was erected at every major pedophile ring meeting! Other victims out there must recognise this !’ I tossed the drawing on the table. Silence... Finally, Jon spoke, ‘Let’s remember that there are victims who couldn’t be here today . . .’ his voice broke as tears welled in his eyes, ‘because they didn’t make it.’ More silence. I continued, ‘I’ve put my neck on the line time and time again for others.’ I lowered my head and fought back tears as I uttered words that caused me immense pain. ‘I’ve never asked for anything for myself...’ I struggled to continue. ’But I’m asking you now – investigate my complaints.’ Pause. ‘Fiona,’ Commissioner Milroy spoke softly and pointed to my folder of evidence, ‘first we have to read that.’ Silence. ‘Fiona, you’re obviously highly intelligent - . . .’ ‘So what ?!’ I snapped. ’What’s the use of having intelligence when institutions continually prevent me from using it?! My life has been destroyed! They’ve continually ruined my finances, my health, my reputation - and now all prospects of employment!’ Silence. ‘Fiona,’ Judge Coat asked, ‘Do you have any final questions?’ ‘Yes,’ I wiped my tears and straightened my posture. ’What am I allowed to share with the public regarding what I experienced here today?’ The judge shif ted awkwardly in her seat, ‘You can’t repeat anything you heard here.’ ‘Show me the legislation.’ ‘What?’ ‘The legislation,’ my tone strengthened. ’Get me the legislation that states what you just said.’ The young lawyer’s eyes widened. She dove into a pile of folders. Minutes later she read out the relevant section. ‘Now,’ I told Judge Coate, ‘interpret that for me.’ 60 Paul Wilson (1990).

As if the Royal Com mission will spend public funds prosecuting a victim instead of investigating her complaints. What a great national news headline that would make . ‘You’ll have to excuse my audacity,’ I offered, ‘but that is what has sustained me.’ ‘Oh no, that’s fine,’ they all agreed. It was time to go. I shook Milroy’s hand, peered deep into her brown eyes and expressed, ‘Thank you. I know you’re genuine.’ ‘Fiona,’ Milroy implored, ‘keep making submissions.’ I mournfully shook my head, ‘What’s the use?’ I met Judge Coate ’s handshake which was so firm I was reminded of the western ritual where men shake hands to establish dominance. I stared defiantly into her right eye and returned her grip with enough strength to make my point but without committing an offence. As I exited the room, the panel members stretched , sighed heavily and exchange d looks which said, That was intense! Jon and I had barely exited the room when he, grinning from ear to ear proudly exclaimed, ‘Oh, Fi! Milroy would have employed you on the spot! Well done! ’ We were escorted into yet another hotel room where a government appointed psychologist waited to debrief me. I engaged in half an hour of intellectual discussion before tiring of it. You must let yourself break, Fiona , my brain warned me. You n eed to feel the emotion before you leave. ‘They’re not going to do a thing,’ I complained. ’This is a whitewash! And I knew it would be. I knew not to get my hopes up. But still I did. A small part of me hoped that there would be justice for me. I’ve never asked for much -. . .’ I lowered my head as my whole being convulsed in emotional release. I wept sorely from some hidden chasm of despair. Minutes passed before I gathered myself enough to speak again. ’I just thought that maybe . . . just maybe. . . for once something might be done for me. But I was wrong. There’s a part of me, buried deep within that’s reserved solely for justice. That part of me opened today for the very first time, but it just got shut right back down again.’ I did not realise it at the time, but a poorly sutured invisible wound was tearing open. My session with the Royal Commission sparked a crazy chain reaction of events including going public, delivering a national press conference, re -entering intensive therapy, making police witness statements, speaking at an international conference, and writing this book. * * * Australia’s ‘Satanic Panic’ A tightly organised, mafia-style, hierarchically structured crime syndicate has infiltrated every aspect of Australian government and society including the judiciary, churches, law enforcement, military, child protection, hospitals, educational facilities, childcare centres, and Parliament. The network has numerous branches and countless members who profit from various illegal activities including drugs, arms and child sex trafficking. It is a well-oiled clandestine machine fuelled by public ignorance and distraction."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 45 Detecting members of this system and their tactics is like driving a new model of car: you suddenly notice all the other cars on the road of the same make and model. Ritual Abuse (aka: RA, Cult Abuse, Satanic Ritual Abuse, SRA) constitutes one facet of the child trafficking machine. The Australian media has reported on RA cases, although references are limited and difficult to locate. Reporting of these cases peaked in the mid - 1990s during the Wood Royal Commission. Damage Control Psychological Op eration The CIA adopted a multi-pronged approach to bury the epidemic of SRA reports and control the Australian narrative. Here is a summary of their tactics: - Establish a bogus investigation, to gather and contain victims and their evidence. - Assassinate all network perpetrators who risked exposing the trafficking operation. - Focus the entire scandal on a handful of outed, now conveniently dead, scapegoats. - Muddy the waters by labelling the pursuit of pedophile crimes ‘homophobia’ and ‘moral panic.’ - Devise a bogus disorder to label and denigrate victims and their therapists with. - Conduct bogus research to support the bogus disorder. - Recruit dirty doctors and hired guns to defend the bogus disorder in the media and courtrooms. - Create derogative newspeak to mock, devalue and discredit victims and their witness testimony; e.g., ‘conspiracy theorist’ and ‘hysterical.’ - Recruit agent journalists to promote the cover -narrative in the mainstream media. - Support subsequent findings of bogus investigation with bogus disorder and research. - Have perpetrator academics teach the bogus research and bogus disorder in universities to perpetuate the lie, deter future therapists from understanding the truth, and forever conceal the child trafficking operation. - Restrict therapists from working with victims of extreme abuse, via new Health Board policy preventing such, and policing , which targets dissident therapists for deregistration. Pedophilia is NOT Homophobia ‘Homophobia’ is the propaganda angle the CIA chose to defend and bury allegations of government involvement in child sex trafficking. Hence the CIA -infiltrated Australian media subtly shifted reader focus from revelations of ritual abuse and VIP pedophilia – to accusations of ‘homophobia’ and minority rights violations. VIP pedophiles routinely ‘came out’ as gay to distract attention from child rape allegations. ‘Metaphor for Incest’ Early 1990s disclosures of ritual abuse and mind control were labelled a ‘metaphor for incest’ by Australia’s most recognised DID expert Warrick Middleton. ‘Metaphor for incest’ is precisely what Gold Coast Hospital head psychiatrist Dr Flanagan parroted at me in 1991. Flanagan and Middleton worked together for the Queensland Health Department. In 1995, journalist Richard Guilliatt quoted Middleton in his article which cast doubt over the validity of ritual abuse testimony:"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 46 ‘I believe it is a metaphor,’ argues Dr Warwick Middlet on, a Brisbane psychiatrist specialising in trauma. ‘It re -creates in the present a scenario that evokes the helplessness of the past.’ 61 Warrick Middleton failed to provide any scientific research to back his opinion that victims’ torturous PTSD flashbacks are merely metaphors. Metaphor is best treated by academia rather than psychiatry. Here is my critique of Guilliatt’s 1995 introduction of the CIA’s new narrative to discredit the wave of SRA reports: Therapy in Turmoil: The Memory Controversy Richard Guilliatt, Sydney Morning Herald, 1 February 1995. In a bizarre modern phenomenon, hundreds of women are dredging up lost memories of childhood abuse involving blood, sex and devil worship. The accusations are criminal – but investigators have never proven a case of Satanic ritual abuse . [Persuasive, misleading reporting. WA police proved and convicted a case of SRA in 1991. Sydney investigators actively buried SRA reports.] By the late 1980s, this phenomenon had spread to both Europe and Australia, most notably with the ‘Mr Bubbles’ case in Sydney, when staff of the Seabeach Kindergarten in northern Sydney were arrested and accused of occult sexual abuse. Therapists, private investigators and police began telling the media this was a problem of great consequence, and a four -part report on Channel 10 in late 1990 prompted police to form a taskforce... In Australia, the Mr Bubbles case collapsed from lack of evidence . Although the principal defendant in the Mr Bubbles case, Anthony Deren, later confessed to fondling adolescent girls earlier in his life, the evidence of occultism amounted to a handful of anti-Satanic books in his home and the fact that children at Sea beach chanted Ram- Sam-Sam, a common children’s song ... [Police sabotaged the case and omitted crucial evidence from court . The DPP prevented Professor Kim Oates (head of the Child Protection Unit at the Camperdown Children’s Hospital ) testifying that his hospital staff found 5 children were sexually abused at Seabeach Kindergarten. The children reported Luciferian chanting, not ‘common’ harmless preschool songs as the agent-journalist persuades the reader to conclude .] Although Satanic abuse stories are not as common in Australia as in the US, one Sydney rape counsellor estimates from her contact with therapists that about 300 women in NSW are being treated for ritual abuse. That estimate is supported by the Herald’s own calls to ‘survivor ’ groups, therapists and sexual assault workers. Phoenix Van Dyke, the organiser of the ritual abuse support group Beyond Survivors, says she has been in contact with more than 200 women who believe they are survivors. The Sydney Rape 61 Richard Guilliatt (1995). Therapy in Turmoil : T he Memory Controversy.

To believe these women , one would have to accept NSW has been permeated by brutal Satanic cults since at least the late `60s, a network of evil which has indulged in murder, prostitution, child pornography and other crimes without leaving evidence ... [‘To believe’ is persuasive language. NSW Police buried the evidence, ambushed victims’ homes, removed kids from whistle -blowers .] One middle -ground view of these stories is that satanic abuse ‘memories, ’ although not literally true, may be a way for incest victims to symbolically represent the evil done to them. ‘I believe it is a metaphor, ’ argues Dr Warwick Middleton, a Brisbane psychiatrist specialising in trauma. ‘It re -creates in the present a scenario that evokes the helplessness of the past.’ [Middleton presented subjective opinion and did not substantiate it with scientific evidence.] But others are beginning to view Satanic ritual abuse as simply a form of mass hysteria sparked by a confluence of events in the early 1980s – growing public alarm about child abuse, the rise of support groups and alternative counselling, the influence of Christian fundamentalism in the US and the popularity of ‘confessional’ TV chat shows such as Oprah, which have given unquestioning coverage to stories of Satanism. [Vague inference. There is n o clarification of ‘others, ’ their qualifications or associations. This is CIA propaganda aimed at swaying the reader’s opinion. ] Therapists are now grappling with the vexed question of whether Satanic abuse survivors are mentally ill people suffering delusions, vulnerable people influenced by their the rapists or actual incest victims who have wildly distorted their abuse . If the latter is true, how many of their memories are reliable , and how can a therapist possibly determine what is fact and what is fantasy ? Remarkably, however, this debate appears to be completely bypassing many of the therapists, child abuse workers and sexual assault counsellors who have banded together to combat ritual abuse. After years of exposure to abuse cases, these counsellors are adamant that there is nothing unbelievable about the vivid detail of the stories they are hearing, and many view the current debate as a ‘backlash’ against their cause. [The agent-journalist does not clarify how many and which ‘therapists’ he refer s to, apart from Middleton who states an unproven opinion . He then introduces CIA concept that victims are ‘deluded,’ ‘fantasists,’ their memories ‘unreliable.’ He is using the NLP equivalent of writing, by repeating the word ‘unreliable.’ ] Among some survivors and even therapists, the ‘backlash’ and the failure of police investigations are now cited as examples of the diabolical cleverness of Satanic cults, whose influence reputedly extends to the top of our society. ‘ It’s very deliberately instigated by people who have an enormous amount to lose, ’ says Janet. ‘I think it’s"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 48 much more than a backlash ... it’s actually orchestrated by ritual abuse perpetrators as a way of discrediting survivors.’ [Repeatedly placing quotation marks around the word ‘backlash’ is designed to persuade the reader to disagree with the professional’s testimony that she experienced a backlash.] This view has been fuelled by allegations, currently under investigation, that NSW police have been bribed by pedophiles . One therapist claims to have seen infra-red Federal Police photographs of nocturnal forest rituals . A Child Protection Services official talks about covens meeting around Australia on certain days of the year. Even the official NSW Government booklet on ritual abuse – distributed to hundreds of health workers since 1993 – dismisses the growing body of contrary evidence as an example of society’s collective ‘ denial. ’ [The agent-journalist’s choice of the word ‘fuelled’ is subjective persuasive writing, not objective news reporting. His placing quotation marks around the word ‘denial’ again persuades the reader to disbelieve the therapist’s witness testimony .] Richard Guilliatt is still writing newspaper article s that subtly undermine the credibility of ritual abuse victims. His 2017 hit piece in The Australian targeted me. 62 Wood Royal Commission The ‘investigation’ referred to in the above article was the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service (aka, Wood Royal Commission) which operated from 13 May 1994 to 30 Jun 1997. Justice James Roland Wood was appointed commissioner. The pur pose of the investigation was to examine allegations of systemic and entrenched corruption within the NSW Police, namely that police were protecting pedophiles, and that some police were themselves involved in pedophile activities and ritual abuse. The Woo d Royal Commission was to specifically examine multiple allegations of Satanic Ritual Abuse at Sydney’s Seabeach Kindergarten. The Wood Royal Commission was sparked by complaints from politician Diedre Grusovin regarding reports of a child trafficking network involving not just police, but politicians, churches, child welfare services, juvenile detention centres, the Education Department, media moguls, and entertainers. The trafficking operation involved the ritual abuse of children who were pimped to Kings Cross brothels. The following Legislative Council document (dated 10 October 1990, p.8046) record ed Grusovin’s complaint: SATANISM The Hon. E.P. PICKERING: On 12th September Reverend the Hon. F.J. Nile asked a question regarding Satanism. The answer is as follows: 1. Yes. 2. No. The Hon. Deirdre Grusovin alluded to a network of pedophiles and said that established networks, such as Satanists, could also be involved in these practices. 3. I can assure the House that any allegations of child abuse or Satanism are and will continue to be thoroughly investigated by the New South Wales Police Service. 62 Richard Guilliatt (2017). ‘Those Events Never Happened.’ The Australian , 30 September."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 49 Wonderful Wollongong Commissioner Wood chose Wollongong as his focus case because he had a big bloody mess to cover up: For those whose memories do not extend back to the mid-1990s, Arena was a Labor politician in the NSW upper house, who gained national attention in 1996 when she named two people – retired judge David Yeldham and former state MP Frank Arkell – as potential pedophiles. At the time, a royal commission into the NSW Police Service headed by Justice James Wood was in full swing, but Arena and others believed it was not doing enough to look at people in high places. Along with fellow Labor MP Deirdre Grusovin, Arena promised to name at least two Sydney men in a parliamentary speech, and the next day asked why the commission had not investigated Yeldham or Arkell. 63 Ordinarily, such allegations would have been met with probably successful defamation actions, but Arena spoke with the protection of parliamentary privilege, protecting her from being sued. Her speech caused an uproar and both men denied being pedophiles. But before long, Yeldham was revealed to have lived a double life as a homosexual, and he took his own life on November 4, 1996. Arkell was horrifically murdered on June 26, 1998, a fortnight after another Illawarra man, David O’Hearn, was killed in equall y brutal fashion in his Albion Park home. The perpetrator in both cases was a 19 -year- old, Mark Valera, who claimed that both men had propositioned him sexually, and that he had been abused by his own father. Frank Arkell (Wollongong mayor), David O’Hearn (Wollongong shopkeeper ), and Trevor John Parkin were ritually murdered. Parkin and O’Hearn were disembowelled. O’Hearn was decapitated and his severed hand used to draw an inverted cross, pentagram, and the word ‘SATAN’ on his walls. 64 Gareth Robinson : Wollongong's daily newspaper has been having a look. The Illawarra Mercury has published a series of stories about the secret lives of some of the city fathers, stories about a child sex ring, about priests and teachers abusing trust. Ther e have been claims of satanic abuse, none ever proven , [note the same subjective persuasive comment .] and a string of convictions in the courts ... The line of inquiry into Wollongong itself runs long and deep. What was revealed at the Royal Commission goes back many years, to another Mayor. He was Tony Bevan, a pilot, property developer, and one-time owner of Bevan's Real Estate Agency... There were complaints that Tony Bevan was having sex with young boys... Tony Bevan, who was known to offer boys the thrill of a ride in the plane he flew on regular shark patrols. Victim : [Tony Bevan] started to take me up to the [Kings] Cross, which was during the week and every weekend. These men were part of the Luciferian pedophile network that ritually abused and sex trafficked boys to the Kings Cross brothels.

Topics covered by Hammond included brainwashing, post -hypnotic programming and the induction of multiple personalities by the CIA. Hammond contended that the cult underground has roots in Nazi Germany, and that the CIA’s cult mind control techniques were based upon those of Nazi scientists recruited by the CIA for Cold Warfare. (Researcher Lenny Lapon estimates in Mass Murderers in White Coats that 5,000 Nazis resettled in the US after WWII.) Hammond was forced to drop this line of inquiry by professional ridicule, especially from the CIA’s False Memory Syndrome Foundation, and a barrage of death threats . At a recent regional conference on ritual child abuse, he regretted that he could no longer speak on the theme of government mind control. 65 MK-ULTRA child rapist and killer Martin Orne cofounded the False Memory Syndrome Foundation . The concept of ‘false memory’ was in fact the brainchild of Lt. Col. Michael Aquino, the US Army Intelligence Officer who headed Psychological Operations. In classic Psy - Op style, Aquino appeared on Oprah dressed in theatrical pop-satanism garb, to muddy the waters after multiple children identified him as a Luciferian pedophile. Aquino was implicated in every major USA case involving CIA child trafficking, ritual a buse and MK -ULTRA mind control, including the McMartin Preschool, Presidio Preschool, and Franklin scandals. Aquino and Orne’s False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) and its Australian counterpart (AFMA) were formed specifically to counter the tidal wave of disclosure by victims of CIA child trafficking and Project MK -UKLTRA which began in the 1980s and peaked in the early 1990s before the CIA effectively shut it down. The FMSF Board comprised of former CIA and military doctors with background s in behaviour modification - not ritual abuse. 66 All members were accused pedophiles and/or CIA perpetrators.

In June 1991, Joseph Geraci, Editor - in-Chief of the pro-pedophilia publication, Paidika: The Journal of Paedophilia interviewed Ralph Underwager in Amsterdam . During this interview, Geraci asked Underwager, ‘Is choosing pedophilia for you a responsible choice for the individual?’ Underwager responded: Certainly, it is responsible . What I have been struck by as I have come to know more about and understand people who choose paedophilia is that they let themselves be too much defined by other people. That is usually an essentially negative definition. Pedophiles spend a lot of time and energy defending their choice. I do n’t think that a pedophile needs to do that. Pedophiles can boldly and courageously affirm what they choose. They can say that what they want is to find the best way to love. I am also a theologian and as a theologian, I believe it is God’s will that there be closeness and intimacy, unity of the flesh, between people. A pedophile can say: ‘This closeness is possible for me within the choices that I’ve made.’ Pedophiles are too defensive. They go around saying, ‘You people out there are saying that what I ch oose is bad, that it’s no good. You’re putting me in prison, you’re doing all these terrible things to me. I have 72 Valerie Sinason (2018). Memory in Dispute .

Now, whether or not they can persuade other people they are right is another matter. ‘Mr Bubbles’ Ritual Abuse Case Ralph Underwager gave crucial evidence in Australia’s notorious ‘Mr Bubbles’ case in which children were sexually and ritually abused while attending Sydney’s Seabeach Kindergarten. Underwager was interviewed by Australia’s 60 Minutes in an episode , Witness for Mr Bubbles, which aired 5 August 1990. Reporter Mike Munro stated: Six weeks ago (17 June 1990) we brought you a story that a number of people, including some in high places, wanted to keep secret: the case against Mr Bubbles. In that report, parents named Tony Deren as the man who had sexually assaulted their children. Deren’s wife ran the kindergarten they attended. Tonight, we investigate another crucial aspect of this disturbing case. You remember, police listed seventeen young victims, and more than fifty (54) criminal charges were eventually laid. But when the Mr Bubbles case went to court, not one of the children was called to give evidence. The charges were thrown out, and Tony Deren was set free. One of the key Deren witnesses was a hired gun from the United States, a psychologist named Ralph Underwager, who says he’s an expert in child sexual abuse. He testified that the children’s evidence had been contaminated, and they were too young to know what the truth was... This is Ralph Underwager, psychologist. He was paid $25,000 and gave crucial evidence in favour of Tony Deren; evidence which helped Deren walk free... Always the same story: three and four-year -olds being lured into bubble baths with a man who sexually abused them. PROFESSOR KIM OATES: Having examined them, and talked with them, I’m absolutely convinced the children were sexually abused. REPORTER: There’s absolutely no doubt? OATES : No doubt at all REPORTER: That’s the evidence Professor Kim Oates wanted to give in court. But he was never asked. As head of the Child Protection Unit at the Camperdown Children’s Hospital in Sydney, he’s known around the world as an expert in detecting child sexual abuse. REPORTER: So, we have 18 children who were examined, five of whom your staff say were definitely sexually abused, and all of them from the same preschool. What’s your reaction to that? OATES : Well, I think if you look at the incidence of significant child sexual abuse in the community, significant enough to lay physical findings in the pre school age group, I think it’s extraordinary.

In 1972, Deren was brought here, charged with the aggravated assault of two young girls. He’d interfered with them in a swimming pool. Something Deren admits. And both charges were proven. REPORTER: There’s no doubt scores of questions remain unanswered in the Mr Bubbles case, and some of them relate to Ralph Underwager, the expert witness Tony Deren paid to testify on his behalf. Ralph Underwager was imperative to Tony Deren’s defen ce . As a supposed independent expert, he testified that the evidence of the Bubbles children had become contaminated. And, they were too young to understand their duty to tell the truth. But, here in America, we’ve certainly discovered Underwager’s reputation and credentials aren’t all they’re cracked up to be. DR ANNA SALTER: Well, he is someone who makes his living going around the country and testifying against children in child sexual abuse cases. He says the same thing in essentially every case. Which is every... REPORTER: And Anna Salter knows what she’s talking about. A PhD from Harvard, and a master’s degree in Early Childhood. She says young children can be believed. DR ANNA SALTER: This is consistent with the literature. If you look at what is the best legal textbook in the country today on children as witnesses, ‘Child Witness: Theory and Practice, ’ Malcolm Meyers says clearly children as young as three can comprehend the duty to tell the truth . REPORTER: And this man is a highly respected legal scholar in America? DR ANNA SALTER: I think he’s fairly clearly the chief leading scholar on child sexual abuse in the country. REPORTER: Six American states have given Dr Salter a grant to check Underwager’s methods in court. And what did she find? DR ANNA SALTER: That he isn’ t accurate. That what he says in court does not necessarily fairly represent the literature. REPORTER: He distorts the facts? DR ANNA SALTER: Uh, frequently. Sometimes he quotes specific studies, and he’s frequently wrong about what the studies say. REPORTER: So, we thought we’d get Dr Salter to analyse the evidence Underwager gave under oath at the Mr Bubbles hearing, where he testified his qualifications had never been questioned. But in an American case, the Swann case, this is what the courts said about Mr Underwager. DR ANNA SALTER: The court remains convinced the psychologist did not have the qualifications to testify as a doctor. The trial court ruled that the psychologist’s proposed testimony was not proper because there was no indication that the results of the doctor’s work had been accepted in the scientific community.

Ralph Underwager has testified for the defendants in about 400 child abuse cases. Wood RC Cover-Up The Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service Final Report was published on 1 May 1997. Three volumes of this report were devoted to pedophilia inquiries. Volume Four, Chapter 5 (pp.99 -116) were solely devoted to the subject of Ritual Abuse. At the end of this chapter, Commissioner James Wood concluded: 5.13 Fr om a common sense perspective, while it must be recognised that apparently respectable and successful members of the community do commit child sexual abuse, a quantum leap in credibility is required to suppose that they would do so in the bizarre, ritualistic way described, which includes the infliction of serious, even fatal, injury and mutilation upon their own children. James Wood’s examination of Ritual Abuse amounted to a blatantly biased white washing . Wood devoted the entire content of Chapter 5 of his report to discrediting victims, parroting critics’ unscientific reasons for why Ritual Abuse does not exist in Australia, excluding the evidence for Ritual Abuse’s existence, and listing alternative possible reasons – none scientifically evidenced – for the epidemic of SRA reports in Australia. James Wood’s list of alternative explanations included: - Mental illness - Substance abuse history - Urban legend - ‘Metaphor for incest’ - Lying to get compensation - Exposure to ritual themes in books, film or television. "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 57 Concerning the last point, Forensic Psychology academics told my post graduate class the media do not influence people’s thinking and behaviour. Horror movies, violent video games and rock music do not influence people to commit heinous crimes. By contrast, Wood claimed film and television influence people to believe that heinous crimes hav e been perpetrated against them. In his Final Report, Commissioner Wood said Ritual Abuse does not exist from a law enforcement perspective because: 1. Rarely, if ever, are bodies of the ‘victims’ or their graves found, nor do neighbours, friends or relatives report children missing in the numbers required to account for the allegations; 2. there is rarely, if ever, any evidence of the kind which can be confirmed by modern forensic technology; 3. signs of physical injury in the form of scarring, burns and t he like, are not found upon medical examination of ‘victims’ who report torture of the most extreme and prolonged kind; more often than not the medical examination fails to confirm the abuse as alleged; 4. in cases of criminal conspiracy, inter -group jealousies or disputes inevitably develop and throw up an informant. In cases of RA, this rarely if ever occurs. Similarly, a co - conspirator who is otherwise in trouble, and prepared to supply information in return for an immunity or assistance in sentencing, rare ly emerges; 5. again, contrary to experience with child sexual abuse generally, most of the offenders are reported to be females; 6. although many ‘victims’ claim that photographs are taken and videotapes made of the activity, visual records of the kind are rare ly found, nor does the large amount of child pornography in circulation portray the bizarre and ritualistic activities described; and 7. so many people tell the same story and allege the involvement of so many others in the events that it is difficult to see how there could not be independent evidence, or knowledge of it on the part of persons outside the alleged rings. I will address James Wood’s 7 points: 1a. Bodies and graves are indeed found. Police and doctors who are part of the trafficking Network wri te bogus reports to coverup the deaths. I witnessed Leonas Petrauskas write a fake death certificate saying a child was stung by a blue bottle, to cover Paul Keating’s crime . When I made a witness statement to Terry Frost at Tweed Heads Police, he said my accounts matched numerous ‘unsolved murders’ in the Sydney areas I named, and he would urgently send my statement to Sutherland detectives. b. Most bodies are disposed of. I witnessed bodies being fed to dogs, cremated in factory furnaces, dissolved in chemical pools, and thrown from a helicopter into the ocean. Bodies are commonly fed to pigs (Paul Keating had a pig farm). I am sure you can think of a few other ways of disposing of dead bodies. Just watch TV for inspiration... c. Most child murder victims are bred by cult members and slave breeders for the purpose of ritual sacrifice. Their births are never registered. Many children are legally stolen from parents via Child Pr otective Services. Thousands of babies were stolen from ‘unfit’ mothers and ‘adopted.’ Many children are trafficked by pedophile parents, and when the innocent parents find out and report the matter to police, dirty cops write bogus reports against the innocent parents who subsequently lose custody of the child victims. I later"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 58 received a call from a lawyer who told me the Sutherland detective in charge of my case covered up the sex trafficking of her client’s son in this manner . d. My cult grandparents’ neighbour who resided at 12 McAlister Ave was also a cult member. His obese wife ‘committed suicide’ after she had a nervous breakdown following the multiple ‘cot deaths’ of her young children. I witnessed one of these ‘cot deaths’ when I was five years old. The preschool boy was ritually sacrificed by the neighbour and my step- grandfather in the front room of the neighbour’s house. Leonas Petrauskas wrote the death certificate. 2. Again, there certainly is evidence. Network members in positions of authority routinely fabricate circumstances surrounding victims’ deaths. Doctors and police routinely falsify death certificates and police reports. Take for example the 1986 murder of Sallie -Anne Huckstepp by dirty cop Roger Rogerson who protected the Sydney child trafficking operation that James Wood investigated. Sallie -Anne was writing an article about the Sydney child trafficking network when Rogerson’s contract on her was fulfilled. Sallie -Anne was found dead in Sydney ’s Centennial park. The usual police coroner was not on duty the day police were called to Sallie -Anne’s body. The substitute officer arrived and was instructed to record the death as suicide by drowning in a p ond. The honest police officer noted struggle marks on Sallie -Anne’s arms and wrote the death up as suspicious. This led to an investigation during which the officer gave what he thought was a confidential testimony; however, by the time he arrived back at his station, everyone knew what he had just said. He was consequently victimised, traumatised, and transferred 1000 kilometres away to Murwillumbah police station. Yet NSW police continued to hound the man; they raided his home multiple times in search of grounds for charging him - such as a pencil taken from work. The cle an cop was forced to retire from the police force. He withdrew to a farm out the back of Mount Warning and never recovered from the trauma of what the corrupt NSW cops did to him. So, if that is what accidentally emerged because a good cop happened to be on duty on the wrong day, imagine what convicted murderer Roger Rogerson’s minions routinely covered up every other day? 3a. As part of their Order of the Illuminati practise s, bloodline victims like me must not be physically flawed or scarred, and sacrifices must be without blemish. My abusers were experts at administering torture techniques, including electrocution, that do not leave physical evidence. It is possible to beat someone in the gut through a phone book to hide superficial evidence of the beating, a traditional police method. b. Some victims do carry scars, but police and medical staff do not believe victim accounts of how these were acquired. DID victim Jennifer Haynes (who made history when her dissociative parts were granted permission to test ify in court) appeared on 60 Minutes (26 May 2019) to discuss her horrific child abuse. Her physical scarring is so severe she wears a colostomy bag and can never have children. Yet her testimony was ‘consistently faced with ridicule and disbelief.’ (Note that during the initial show trailer, Jennifer mentioned being subjected to ‘ritual abuse’ – yet 60 Minutes subsequently edited this out of the broadcasted episode.) c. Any leakage of physical evidence is routinely covered up. I accidentally suffocated during a ritual and was transported to Sutherland Hospital for resuscitation. To cover for the incident , my perpetrators told hospital staff one of the cult members was my mother, and duped medical staff release me into her care. 4. The notion that an informant would voluntarily step forward is the most ridiculous point on James Wood’s list. Like the mafia, pedophile ring membership is a life -long"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 59 commitment. As the famous Hotel California song says, ‘You can check out any time you like but you can never leave.’ At six years of age, deep in the National Park, I witnessed the fate of a ‘traitor’ who tried to leave the pedophile ring. Each of the man’s four limbs was tied to a different vehicle. The four vehicles then accelerated in opposite directions. I certainly was reluctant to talk after being made to watch that . 5. I witnessed male and female ritual abuse perpetrators, and believe me, the women were as debauched as the men. However, a disproportionate number of men were involved in my abuse, and in the abuse of the numerous other ritual abuse victims who contacted me. 6. As for Wood’s reference to an alleged lack of videotape and other evidence, consider the 2004 disappearance of the video evidence that Dr Reina Michaelson submitted to the Victorian Police Commissioner. The video footage featured men in Victorian Police uniform raping preschool children at a Mornington Peninsula childcare centre. The video footage ‘disappeared’ in police custody. Reina told me she was subsequently slapped with a ‘D-Notice’ on the grounds that what she knew about the government’s involvement in child trafficking could undermine the public’s confidence in the government. 7. When examining ritual abuse from a law enforcement perspective, James Wood ignored the following ritual abuse case which preceded his ‘investigation’ by three years: CHILD SEX ABUSE LINKED WITH SATANISM: POLICE David Humphries, Sydney Morning Herald, 13 March 1991. PERTH: Perth police say they have proved a link between organised child sex abuse and devil worship, following the conviction on Monday of a young man on 22 charges of indecent assault and dealing and of evil intent. The head of WA’s child sex abuse unit, Detective-Sergeant Roger Smart, said the conviction of Scott Brian Gozenton demonstrated the link. Satanic practices ‘and the associated abuse perpetrated on children is prevalent in the United States and Britain and no -one can now doubt that the link can be made here, ’ Sergeant Smart said. Gozenton, 20, pleaded guilty to all charges and was remanded until April 5 for sentencing after the District Court was told that 13 witchcraft covens operated in Perth. Judge Kennedy was told that Gozenton had been a vi ctim of sex abuse as an eight-year -old and had been recruited as a teenager into a satanic cult where adults practised bizarre sex with each other, their own children and teenage recruits. The more bizarre and perverse the orgies, the closer cult members felt to the Devil, Gozenton’s barrister, Mr Mark Trowell, said. ‘The real villains are those individuals who visited their perversity on this young man, ’ Mr Trowell said. Gozenton was a tragic result of sexual abuse perpetrated by a school caretaker against himself and six other boys for three years. Shame prevented him from revealing his ‘terrible secret’ and he became introverted, rebellious and distant from his parents. ‘At the age of 14, he was approached by a school chum about a new family where rebellion was encouraged and someone like this young man could get a sense of belonging, ’ Mr Trowell said. He said the coven was attended by about 20 adults of both sexes, their young children and the teenage recruits. Rituals were both homosexual and heterosexua l, he said. His client had recognised cult members at earlier hearings but had refused to identify them for fear of reprisals, Mr Trowell said. ‘These evil people kept this young man"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 60 under their spell and direction for four years while these offences against him were committed. He...was instructed to establish a junior coven for the purpose of recruiting junior members from school and the Scout group with which he was associated. ’ Mr Trowell said the initiation rituals mostly involved touching of genitals and, apart from three charges of oral sex were ‘not unduly perverse.’ The evil design charges related to attempts to recruit others into the cult, where Gozenton had the code name of Death. He said Gozenton had been seeking to extricate himself from the satanists, established a stable relationship with a woman and improved relations with his parents and did not deserve a jail sentence. Mr Chris Drew, for the Crown, said the charges against Gozenton were ‘extremely serious’ and that jail was the only option available. The Devil Made Me Do It Royal Commissioner James Wood also ignored the Australian 60 Minutes episode that aired in the late 1980s called, The Devil Made Me Do It . It aired one year after an episode , Satan’s Children, in which a 15-year-old English girl Teresa detailed her experience of Ritual Abuse. Reporter Ian Leslie presented both episodes. The Devil Made Me Do It involved a discussion panel including Senator Fred Nile plus two former coven pedophile ring members, a young man from Sydney and a young woman from Adelaide. The Adelaide woman was under police investigation for her involvement in criminal activities (including the ritual murder of babies) which, she said, were committed on campus by a coven comprised of University of Adelaide staff and students. Elizabeth Loftus : CIA Psychologist Royal Commissioner James Wood used the gangrenous writings of CIA psychologist Elizabeth Loftus to dismiss multiple witness accounts of organised pedophilia and ritual abuse. Wood’ s Final Report referenced Loftus’ 1994 book, The Myth of Repressed Memory: False Memories and Allegations of Sexual Abuse , to support his conclusions: a. ‘False memories’ of Ritual Abuse can be artificially created as a result of third person suggestion, b. A victim of Ritual Abuse can’t experience dissociation and repression of traumatic memories, and c. Ritual Abuse victims are female ‘attention-seeking’ hypochondriacs whose flashbacks may be attributed to overly zealous female therapists. Loftus’ 1994 book was not a scientifically conducted, peer reviewed research publication. It was just a book. At the time of her 1994 book release, Loftus had published one study relevant to her ‘false memory’ theory, an experiment which examined university students’ memory for films of car accidents. 73 73 E.

Subjects’ family members were asked to provide James Coan with three true childhood stories about the subjects, and to describe a typical family shopping trip. Based on the shopping trip descriptions, a false story was created for each subject about getting lost as a child during a shopping trip. Subjects were told their family members said the events ‘had happened.’ The subjects were asked to repeat the stories and to try and remember more details. Finally, the subjects were told that one of the memories was false and asked to choose the false memory. Elizabeth Loftus conducted and published this research before receiving ethical approval for the study. Loftus added a second interview plus another evaluation scale to the research protocol long after the study was approv ed on 10 August 1992. James Coan reported in his 1993 honours thesis that only 6/24 subjects completed the study, and zero subjects created a false memory. 79 80 Crook and Dean (1999) analysed Loftus’ data and discovered only 2/24 subjects likely completed the study. 81 First year psychology students are taught, a minimum of n=10 subjects is required for valid statistical analysis. So, Loftus blatantly lied when she reported: ‘Of the 24 total, 19 subjects correctly chose the getting-lost memory as the false one, while the remaining five incorrectly thought that one of the true events was the false one ... These findings reveal that people can be led to believe that entire events happened to them after suggestions to that effect .’ 82 The raw data from the shopping mall study were subpoenaed by defence attorneys in Burgus v. Braun . Loftus successfully obtained a gag order for her fraudulent data. The case settled on 31 October 1997 and the data returned to Loftus. Elizabeth Loftus published another lab experiment in 1996. 83 This examined, ‘whether imagining events from one’s past can affect memory for childhood events.’ A total of 38 undergraduate psychology students (young female university students studying the same course ) participated in the study for course credit. Loftus asked the students to imagine described events such as tripping over or falling through a window. The characteristics of Elizabeth Loftus’ samples made it inappropriate for her to generalise findings from her studies to the population at large . And yet Loftus drew 74 E. Loftus & J. Pickrell .

Loftus basically equate d a psychology student’ s experience of watching a car crash film or imagining themselves falling over – with real life accounts of being systematically raped and tortured throughout one’s development . That is beyond preposterous. Elizabeth Loftus’ conclusions failed to hold up under cross examination. In 1994, Lynn Crook successfully sued Loftus. Lawyer Barbara Jo Levy asked Loftus, ‘If you are asked to testify about your experiments of implanting false memories, would you use those first six?’ Loftus replied, ‘No, I don’t think I will use the first six’ (Transcript, p.61). In December 1995, two women filed ethics complaints against Elizabeth Loftus with the American Psychological Association , claiming she had misrepresented their successful recalled-memory lawsuits to the media. Loftus resigned from the APA in January 1996, so the APA dropped their investigation. A Washington Post article entitled, In the Sharon Case, a Grilling to Remember (27 October 2006) described a damning cross examination of Elizabeth Loftus: But when Fitzgerald got his chance to cross -examine Loftus about her findings, he had her stuttering to explain her own writings and back pedalling from her earlier assertions. Citing several of her publications, footnotes and the work of her peers, Fitzge rald got Loftus to acknowledge that the methodology she had used at times in her long academic career was not that scientific , that her conclusions about memory were conflicting , and that she had exaggerated a figure and a statement from her survey of D.C. jurors that favoured the defence. In 2003, Nicole Tau successfully sued Loftus for invasion of privacy. At age six years, during a videotaped interview by a medical doctor, Tau had accused her mother of child abuse. Tau subsequently forgot her abuse but spontaneously recalled it at age 17 years. Corwin and Olafson (1997) published an article about the case , favouring the notion that repressed memory of childhood abuse can be recalled. Elizabeth Loftus set out to discredit Tau by hiring a pri vate investigator to locate Tau. The PI lied to Tau’s family by pretending to be Corwin’s research assistant. Loftus subsequently published an article based on the PI’s interviews with Tau’s family in which she identified Tau as a victim of crime. Tau filed an ethics complaint against Loftus in 1999 with the University of Washington who upheld the complaint. During a 2013 TED Talk about memory, Loftus intentionally misrepresented the basic facts of Nicole Tau’s case by saying it was about a ‘woman’ who ‘accused her mother of sexual abuse based on a repressed memory.’ Loftus knowingly omitted crucial facts of the case: that Tau was six years old when she made the report, then forgot the memory, and then spontaneously and accurately recalled the memory 11 years later at age 17 years.

The following is a letter to the FMA from Jerome Gelb (the psychiatrist who took a loaded handgun to court): NEWS FROM AUSTRALIA The Australian False Memory Association has now been formally organized. The links between the AFMA and Australian professionals seem strong and the fact that the Australian Psychological Society [APS] has already established guidelines for recovered memory situations indicates a positive and determined approach by professionals to deal with the problem. A letter from Dr Jerome Gelb, a psychiatrist in Australia, affirms this optimism. He states, ‘I am writing to keep you up to date with events in Australia regarding FMS and Recovered Memory Therapy. Australian Psychiatrists are, apart from very few exceptions, fully aware of the iatrogenesis of so-called repressed memories, MPD and Satanic Abuse. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists has been helpful in publishing on the issue.’ Dr Gelb mentioned the television and newspaper articles that have recently appeared in Australia noting that they understand the iatrogenic nature of some memories. Dr Gelb said that he had published a detailed letter to the Editor in the December 1994 RANZCP Journal of Psychiatry and that the journal of Australasian Psychiatry, Vol 2, No 4, Augu st 1994, pp 179-180 had published his article, ‘ Reality Revisited.’ Dr Gelb went on to write that, ‘I feel that public opinion in Australia is supportive and the media is also . Most importantly, Australian Psychiatrists are almost universally wary of American therapy fads and are highly critical of poorly trained therapists and the inappropriate use of suggestion, persuasion and memory recovery techniques of all kinds. Please let your membership know of these developments.’ 84 * * * CIA-Dictated APS Recovered Memory Guidelines The APS Guidelines Relating to Recovered Memories were introduced on 27 October 1994. According to the 1994 US FMS newsletter, the APS Guidelines Relating to Recovered Memories were adapted from a book written by MK-ULTRA hypnosis researchers Australian Peter W. Sheehan and Kevin M. McConkey which was based on their hypnosis research. 85 Peter Sheehan and Kevin McConkey both conducted hypnosis research with MK-ULTRA psychiatrist Martin T. Orne. 86 Kevin McConkey was the current APS President, and his 84 FMS Foundation Newsletter (1994). 1 November, 3:10. 85 K.M. McConkey & P.W. Sheehan (1995).

Here are the key points from APS Guidelines Relating to Recovered Memories that stopped Australian psychologists acknowledging the existence of ritual abuse and mind control, and treating victims of extreme abuse, for the following 25 years: - Memories can be altered, deleted, and created by events that occur during and after the time of encoding, and during the period of storage, and during any attempts at retrieval. - Although some clinical observations support the notion of repressed memories, empirical research on memories generally does not. Moreover, the scientific evidence does not allow general statements to be made about any relationship between trauma and memory . - The available scientific and clinical evidence does not allow accurate, inaccurate, and fabricated memories to be distinguished in the absence of independent corrob oration . - Assumptions that adult problems may or may not be associated with repressed memories from childhood can’t be sustained by available scientific evidence. - Psychologists should be alert to the role that they may play in creating or shaping false memories. - Psychologists should seek to meet the needs of clients who report memories of abuse and should do this quite apart from the truth or falsity of those repor ts. - Psychologists should explore with the client the meaning and implications of the memory for the client , rather than focus solely on the content of the reported memory. - Psychologists should be aware that research is needed to understand more about trauma-related memory, techniques to enhance memory, and techniques to deal effectively with childhood sexual abuse. Let me place things into perspective : T he men who wrote these APS Guidelines trained under Martin Orne who, according to US Congressional witness testimony, raped, tortured and murdere d children in the name of national security and psychological research. Here is my retort to the above points: - There is zero scientific evidence to support the claim that mainstream therapists can create false memories. Only MK-ULTRA doctors possess the knowledge and military technology to radically alter memory. Memories can only be deleted during and after encoding using unethical hypnosis, illicit drugs, torture, and cutting -edge medical procedures . - ‘False memory syndrome’ is not a recognised mental health condition, has no clinical history or symptomology (when Repressed Memory has both) and does not feature in the DSM. - A range of studies using various methodologies across cultures support a causal relationship between trauma and dissociation (alterations in memory and identity). One research team found, ‘strong empirical support for the hypothesis that trauma causes dissociation, and that dissociation remains related to trauma history when"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 65 fantasy proneness is controlled. We find little support for the hypothesis that the dissociation-trauma relationship is due to fantasy proneness or confabulated memories of trauma.’ 87 - The APS basically ruled that unless the therapist can find a third-party witness to the abuse, they should not work with - or even acknowledge as substantially true - the client’s abuse memories. The APS should apply the same rule for every experience a client brings to therapy , otherwise that is bias. Courts consider an individual’s witness testimony a form of evidence , yet the APS does not. Perpetrators are adept at concealing their crimes and eliminating witnesses, a fact the APS ignores. - Genuine belief in a client’s testimony is essential for establishing rapport and eliciting client trust. Therapists can’t possibly meet the therapeutic needs of Extreme Abuse victims unless they believe and understand the abuse account. A client will trust sufficiently to disclose their abuse details, and therefore integrate , only once they perceive the therapist sincerely believes them. Empathy and belief can’t be feigned toward hypervigilant high IQ victims. - Victims will never process and heal from extreme childhood abuse unless therapy focusses on the actual abuse memor ies, including the thoughts and feelings experienced during the childhood trauma incident, instead of what the adult victim presently thinks and feels about their memories of Extreme Abuse . Loftus Legacy in Australia Elizabeth Loftus was discredited, professionally disciplined, and successfully sued in the USA for her blatant lack of ethical conduct and unscientific methodology. Despite this, Loftus’ unproven opinion regarding memory : (a) was the basis for Royal Commissioner James Wood’s dismissal of multiple independent reports of Ritual Abuse ; (b) p rovides the Australian blueprint for dismissing the nature and existence of extreme child abuse within mental health, education, and forensics ; and (c) underpins all psychology teaching and educational te xts in Australia. Most Australian psychology textbooks are American imports. Mine were. A 2014 study examined three undergraduate psychology textbooks and found, all three concluded that child abuse memories are likely false. 88 All three textbooks referenced Loftus’ writings. Owing to this unfounded and illogical embracement of Loftus’ opinion: - Australian universities and educational materials teach psychology students that most child abuse memories are false , and repressed trauma memories are particularly unreliable . - Regulatory bodies deter psychologists from acknowledging the validity of repressed child abuse memories and working with implicit trauma memories. - Australian psychology students receive no training in the Trauma Model approach. - Australian therapists receive zero training in recognising or treating ritual abuse and mind control. 87 C.J.

Failed Wood Royal Commission During a 1997 parliamentary hearing, Senator Fred Nile addressed the Mr Bubbles case and the Wood Royal Commission’s mishandling of it as follows: The Hon F Nile : I seek the indulgence of the Attorney General. I wish to ask him a question without notice. Why did the children who attended the Seabeach Kindergarten, of the Mr Bubbles case notoriety, receive more than $500,000 compensation? How is it possible that the Government of New South Wales, through the Victims Compensation Fund, is able to pay compensation to the children who were at the Seabeach Kindergarten even though the Wood Royal Commission refused to make any findings about the case and the Director of P ublic Prosecutions was unable to successfully prosecute the perpetrators of the alleged assaults? Government officials subsequently deemed the Wood Royal Commission a ‘failure.’ In May 2002, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs conducted an inquiry into crime in the community. An excerpt from Volume 2 of their Report (published August 2004) reads: Almost immediately, the Committee received substantial submissions covering all aspects of the Inquiry. From New South Wales came very serious allegations of corruption in New South Wales policing, including allegations of protection of pedophiles , ‘doctoring’ of police statistics, corruption of the newly introduced promotions system for duty officers, the failure of the Wood Royal Commission and the systemic failure of bodies set up to investigate such issues. Instead of being applauded for seeking remedie s, the whistle-blowers received punitive treatment ... Subsequent Cases Reports of organised pedophilia and ritual abuse continued to surface in multiple locations around Australia, following the failed Wood Royal Commission and the subsequently established Police Integrity Commission also headed by James Wood. Here are some case examples: 1. Brisbane ABC, CJC Pedo Network Senator Bill Heffernan stated in the Australian House of Parliament (29 May 1998): Recently I made a speech in which I highlighted the code of silence which protects worldwide child sex networks; in particular, Australian pedophile networks. These networks include people in the judiciary, parliament, clergy and the Public Service. Many of these people live in an abhorrent culture in which is included as a ‘spoils of office’ the right to have sex with children ."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 67 These people put themselves at continual risk of serious compromise in their workplaces as perpetrators, as too do those people who knowingly ignore or turn a blind eye to this ultimate betrayal of our children. Honourable senators should be concerned at recent developments involving the Criminal Justice Commission, the body set up to investigate official corruption in State after th e Fitzgerald inquiry. One of the senior members of this body, Mr Bob Hailstone, a former priest and manager of the ABC in Brisbane, and director of the corruption prevention division of the CJC [Criminal Justice Commission] has left the CJC in what could only be called exceptional circumstances. In November last year a State police pedophilia task force raided Hailstone’s house at 31 Dudley Street, Bardon and took possession of a great deal of obscene material. Last week Eric Goh, a man who lives with Hailstone at 31 Dudley Street, appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on charges of possessing for sale indecent or obscene material. These charges raise serious issues of concern. I have in my possession a letter which I will now read into the public re cord, and which records disturbing incidents alleged to have occurred at Mr Hailstone’s house. The letter was written by a man, Mr Phillip Wood, shortly before he died. Hailstone recently resigned from the CJC rather than face disciplinary charges includin g association with an inappropriate person. It seems to me that the whole period of Hailstone’s service with the CJC should be examined, particularly as this body has failed in the past to investigate pedophilia allegations. The letter written to a Brisban e solicitor reads as follows: Dear Malcolm, This is my account of the incident on 30th June 1996. On 30th June 1996 I attended a luncheon party at the home of Mr. Robert Hailstone , 31 Dudley Street, Rainworth. In attendance were a total of fourteen persons, including Mr. Robert Hailstone – it then m entions a second and third person – the others I either didn’t know or can’t remember their names. During the course of the luncheon, some of the guests and the host were talking about having sex with young Asian boys, especially during their holidays in T hailand . This conversation was somewhat disturbing to me as I regard pederasty as anathema, but I said nothing. Later on , the conversation was about the church and their involvement in it, some of the group having been to church that day. This triggered a hostile reaction in me, and I asked them how they could be involved in an institution that so vocally condemns homosexuality. This prompted an outburst of abuse by one of their number to me, with me responding by calling them a bunch of churchgoing pedophiles and saying that they should be outed (meaning to publicly expose them). I then left the house. As I was reversing out of the driveway (there were a number of cars parked there) I clipped the wing mirror of one of the cars. This bought the lot of th em out onto the driveway, shouting abuse and kicking the driver’s side of my car breaking the driver’s side window . I was bleeding from the broken glass and being physically attacked by a number of persons . In an attempt to escape I reversed into a tree an d drove into the side of a car parked in the driveway. In the melee that followed one of their number managed to turn off the ignition of my car and remove the key. I was then left alone in my car whilst they huddled"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 68 together a few metres away. I used a sp are key and drove out of the driveway. I was covered in glass and blood and very shaken up, but I drove to my home in Victoria Point without incident. I had arrived at the luncheon at approx. 12:15 pm and arrived at my home at 3:30 pm. Mr Robert Hailstone, who is a director of the CJC had stated to me on a couple of occasions that he could have anyone in Queensland arrested on a trumped -up drug charge . With this in mind , l was afraid to report the incident to the police. l paid for the repairs to the side of my car ($920) and made two separate claims to the NRMA insurance company for the damage to the front ($2785.18) and rear ($870.89) of my car. I hope that this account is comprehensive enough. Yours Sincerely, Phillip J. Wood Madam President, this letter was dated 8 November 1996. Mr Wood was found dead in his home on 10 November 1996. * * * 2. NSW Central Coast Coven Evil in the Woods Miranda Wood & Martin Chulov, The Sun Herald, 8 Aug 1999, p7. The Police Integrity Commission is probing a shocking series of allegations that pedophiles have been protected by police and officials entrusted to care for the children. Police have uncovered evidence of central coast sites used in satanic rituals, to which drawings made by children who claim to have been abused, bear an eerie resemblance. One mother's traumatised child tells of adult groups hanging him from a cross, killing animals, performing sexual acts on cult members and watching orgies. A child from a separate family, who does not know the other child, tells an identical story. The Sun -Herald has seen evidence of the rituals . One mother, Genevieve, who has fought a four -year campaign to have authorities probe her claims said her case was similar to 33 other cases reported to the Department of Community Services . Medical evidence has proved that both Genevieve's children have been abused. ‘I'm coming across more and more women who tell the same story,’ she said. ‘I've spent years trying to get help for my children, but there are people who don't want this to come out. As he comes to feel safer, he has given more detailed explanations of what has happened to him and his brother. They held laser lights in their eyes to disorientate them. They were locked in basements and they had to watch each other being abused. He couldn't have possibly made all of this up.’ Genevieve said the boys had told her the names of those who assaulted them, and"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 69 they could recall seeing at least 30 people at rituals in the bush. She said she believed the cult's rituals had been passed through generations of satanic covens . ‘My son can recognise members in the street and he even knows their names,’ she said. The children called the bushland site ‘the woods.’ They would ta ke long walks through the bush and it was always at night. The ceremonies were held at night,’ Genevieve said. The drawings by each child also show the same violent acts and symbols used by the cult. One of the symbols Genevieve's son drew was the same s ymbol on the ceremonial table police have taken a photo of at the bushland site. Genevieve said the children were afraid to tell of the ritualistic abuse after cult members threatened to kill them and their mothers . Cult members also told them a bomb in their stomach would explode if the truth was revealed - a trait associated with worldwide satanic covens. Genevieve said her son could also remember being drugged and hypnotised . ‘He said they dressed in black robes and had eye and mouth pieces cut out,’ she said. ‘I know they're pretty dangerous people. I have had warnings outside the house telling me to stop investigations. We're fearful for our lives. The boys never want me out of their sight.’ She is now battling to let the truth come out and protect other children from a fate similar to that of her sons. Genevieve said: ‘It's an absolute nightmare. You try to get help and you have the door slammed in your face repeatedly. I'd do anything to stop this from happening again. After a while they make you f eel as though you dreamed it all up. The laws and the attitudes need to change.’ Commissioner James Wood headed the organisation (Police Integrity Commission) which investigated this case , which subsequently went nowhere. Are the victims and witnesses now dead? 3. National ALP Pedophile Network SA Parliamentary Speaker of the House, Peter Lewis, stated (1 April 2005 ): There are a large number, but not a high percentage, of people in high places and positions of trust who take it for granted that they can indulge their sexual appetites for children of both sexes so long as they arrange to cover it up and get away with it ... It’s a national problem and MPs involved seem to know each other . On 4th April 2005, Peter Lewis resigned his position as Speaker of the South Australian Parliament. He resigned amidst allegations that certain ministers and journalists thwarted his attempts to expose high-end pedophilia rings by reducing his concerns about pedophilia to ‘ homophobia .’ Lewis stated during his parting speech: I...was quietly, and as quickly as possible, bringing some of the people who had made the allegations to the point where they might pluck up enough courage and confidence and swear the truth of those allegations, enabling them to be more carefully investigated. But they were being ‘bumped off’ - that is, murdered and viciously assaulted – quicker than I or the people who were helping me could get"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 70 them to write down their allegations and then swear that what they were saying was true... The most outrageous thing of all...is...what appears to be the related and organised activities of those pedophiles in high public office – that is, the judiciary, the senior ranks of human services portfolios, some police and MPs, across the nation, especially within the ranks of the Labor Party . Yet you only have to recall in recent years the investigations, charges and successful convictions against such people as Darcy, Liddy, Wright, Wells, a former senator and other current and past MPs in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria to understand my concern. They have not acted alone or in isolation, it seems to me... It is not surprising th at we find [ pedophiles] in the jobs and roles of leadership. * * * 4. Melbourne Priest Luciferian Pedophile Ring In 2006, the Catholic Church’s Melbourne diocese acknowledged as ‘substantially true’ allegations that a priest took part in ritual murders in the 1960s and paid compensation to a surviving victim. PRIEST DID ‘RITUAL KILLING’ Gary Hughes, The Courier Mail, 26 May 2006. A Catholic priest took part in satanic murders and rituals that included child sexual abuse . The Catholic Church’s Melbourne Archdiocese has accepted claims about the rituals as ‘substantially true ’ and paid $33,000 compensation to a man who was a victim of the rituals as a child. The archdiocese’s independent sexual abuse investigator, barrister Peter O’Callaghan, QC, described the details of the ritualised murders and sexual abuse provided by the victim as ‘extraordinary... but I have no reason or justification for doubting his credibility, ’ Mr O’Callaghan said in a letter to the victim’s lawyers in 2000. Earlier during a formal interview with the victim, Mr O’Callaghan said he was satisfied the man was telling the truth.’ I see no reason why I shouldn’t accept what you say, ’ he said. ‘ Amazing as it is, I accept it ...’ In a sworn statement given to the archdiocese, the victim said he was first abused by the priest in Melbourne in the early 1960s, when he was serving as an altar boy at the Sacred Heart Church in Sandringham. The priest has since died. In his statement the 56-year -old victim, who wishes to remain anonymous, gave details of at least three deaths – a young woman, a young man and a child – that occurred during satanic rituals over a number of years . Two vict ims had their throats cut and a third was killed with an axe. Animals were also killed during the ceremonies . ‘I have some gruesome memories of killings, ’ the victim said... "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 71 The independent compensation panel made a $33,000 ex-gratia payment to the victim in 2001 after his claims had been investigated by Mr O’Callaghan. The archdiocese is paying for counselling for the man, who has been diagnosed as suffering from complex post-traumatic stress disorder. * * * ‘EXTRAORDINARY’ CLAIMS TRUE : CATHOLIC CHURCH Gary Hughes, NEWS.com, 26 May 2006. The most extraordinary thing about today’s allegations of murders during satanic rituals involving a Melbourne priest is not that they’ve been made, but that the Catholic Church admitted in writing that it accepted they were substantially true. Indeed ‘extraordinary ’ was the word used by the Melbourne Archdiocese’s experienced sexual abuse investigator Peter O’Callaghan QC to describe the allegations when they were put to him in 2000... The statement provided to the Archdiocese by the victim, who wants to re main anonymous, makes chilling reading. He details how the Catholic priest, who has since died, first began abusing him at the age of 11 in 1961 when he was serving as an altar boy at the Sacred Heart Church in the bayside suburb of Sandringham and attendi ng a Catholic school, where the priest was chaplain. The priest got the victim alone in a room on the pretext of giving him a sex education lesson and sexually abused him. Later the priest would sexually abuse the boy in his car and at the Sacred Heart Church’s presbytery, where the victim was lured on the promise of playing with toy soldiers. But it’s the accounts of satanic rituals and the victim’s eyewitness reports of murders that are harrowing. In the statement he details at least three murders – a young girl, a youth and a young child. He says the victims were mostly drugged and appeared to be in a daze before having their throats cut or being hacked with an axe . He says he was forced to take part in the rituals and was sexually abused during them by the priest and others involved in the ceremonies. While claims of satanic rituals and ritualised sexual abuse by victims are nothing new, what makes these allegations different is the Melbourne Archdiocese’s acceptance of the claims as being true . To our knowledge, it is the first time the Catholic Church in Melbourne has done that in writing . Some of the rituals, which occurred over a three -year period, took place in an old house owned by the Catholic Church in Sandringham.

The victim’s decision to speak out follows the conviction in the United States earlier this month of Catholic priest Gerald Robinson for the ritualistic murder of a nun . He said he believed there were other victims of ritualised abuse in Australia who were too afraid or embarrassed to speak out. Robinson was charged with the murder of the nun 26 years ago after a female victim of child sexual abuse went to authorities with claims that the priest had been involved in satanic rituals . The victim in the two articles is James Shanahan. Cardinal George Pell, who signed the (5 January 2001) letter of apology to James, was one of James Shanahan’s Luciferian pedophile perpetrators. 5. Bathurst, NSW Police and Clergy Pedophile Network In 2008, a decade after the Wood Royal Commission ruled that Ritual Abuse does not exist in Australia, the greatest Ritual Abuse scandal in Australia’s history broke into mainstream media. The following two newspaper articles refer to this case: CHANTING, SPELLS AND SEX ORGIES AT ST STANISLAUS COLLEGE Gemma Jones, Herald Sun, 27 Aug 2008. POLICE are investigating claims that up to 40 boys were sexually abused by a pedophile ring of priests and teachers at an exclusive NSW school... A former priest at the school has been charged with 33 counts, a former teacher has already been convicted of several offences and two other teachers are under investigation. In his first interview, a brave young man who used the internet to expose the abuse revealed the full extent of the horror at the school. He is one of two victims who have told The Daily Telegraph how they were herded into a prayer room by a priest chanting ‘hypnotic’ spells in tongues . Inside the prayer room, the boarders who attended the school in the 1980s said they were subjected to horrendous sexual abuse or forced to assault each other... A former boarder now aged 35, who can’t be identified because of a court suppression order, started at St Stanislaus in the ’80s because it was the only private school in the area his family could afford. He alleged the abuse began after a priest took him aside for private tutoring about the Catholic Church and God two months after he arrived at the school and the horror turned into a twice -weekly event. ‘They got a group between eight and 12 of us together and they’d just start chanting and I would wake up during these sessions and see what was going on,’ he said. ‘It was like an orgy .’"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 73 The second victim, who declined to give permission to be named, yesterday described the horrific night-time prayer sessions in the staff’s quarters unde r candlelight . ‘You’d pass out ... they spoke in tongues ... another element was called laying on hands, that was the basis on which he would engage in physical contact,’ the victim said. He said the students were all small in stature and many of them emotiona lly troubled. ‘I know of people who have been contacted, they said, ‘Yes, you’re right but I haven’t told my wife what happened to me I’m not going to tell you guys (police),’ he said. Police last night confirmed 13 alleged victims had already come forward . * * * Abuse at St Stanislaus College ‘Involved Night Orgies ’ Angus Hohenboken, The Australian, 28 Aug 2008. ORGIES involving up to 60 schoolboys , priests and teachers are among allegations levelled at former staff members of a NSW Catholic boarding school. The Seven Network last night reported claims that nine former teachers and priests from St Stanislaus College in Bathurst, in eastern NSW, had committed sexual abuse on students during ‘ hypnotic ’ night prayer services in the 1980s. An alleged victim, whose identity was withheld for legal reasons, said the number of victims involved in the encounters had grown over time. ‘It started out on a one -on- one basis and then in small groups of between eight and 12, and then on one occasion there was a large group of at least 60 ...’ The victim whistle -blower was Tor Nielsen. The group of 60 Tor referred to were 60 children raped during a Luciferian ritual in Bathurst City Hall. This pedophile orgy was attended by visiting NSW police officers who boarded at St Stanislaus College dur ing the famous Bathurst car race. Suspicious St Stanislaus Deaths Tor Nielsen did a letter drop in Bathurst to expose the pedophile ring. Consequently, his lawyer who failed to silence Tor ‘fell’ from an eighth story apartment. Another witness died under suspicious circumstances, the day before he was due to testify in the pedophile trials. The deceased was a lawyer and a former St Stanislaus College student whose son attended the school. He worked at Frederick Jordon Chambers in Sydney. One morning, the chambers clerk found the lawyer hanged to death by his tie from a bookshelf in the basement. He was not suicidal. Staff witnessed him in a normal mood and working on one of his cases, thirty minutes before his time of death. Although attending police considered the death suspiciou s, it was later ruled a suicide. "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 74 6. Brisbane, Queensland Brisbane Grammar Counsellor Ritually Abused Students, Royal Commission Told Joshua Robertson, The Guardian , 4 Nov 2015. A counsellor at a prestigious Queensland private school ritually hypnotised students before masturbating them, slapping them in the face and putting acupuncture needles in one child’s genitals, the royal commission into institutional responses to child sex abuse has heard. The scores of alleged victims of Kevin Lynch at Brisbane Grammar school included a boy who was sexually abused in a grief counselling session given after learning his father had committed suicide... One alleged victim of Lynch, known only as BQK, told the commission that the counsellor’s ‘treatment [was] built around his convincing me that I could harness the power of my orgasms to gain an edge ’ in studies and sport. ‘ He would regularly masturbate me to the point of ejaculation and sometim es would make me ingest my own semen, ’ he said. Lynch also slapped the boy in the face to ‘psyche me up about winning a metaphorical race. Other times he would use acupuncture needles and put them into my testicles or stick his thumb in my anus, ’ BQK said. BQK told the commission he ‘assumed this was a normal treatment method ’ and did not appreciate he had been seriously abused until ‘well into my adult life.’ He said he could not understand why Grammar staff had not questioned why Lynch operated out of a room that had two heavy, soundproof doors, red and green light signals controlling student access, and had significant stocks of tissues and towels, which he used to wipe up semen. The room was set up as a ‘sick conveyer belt of victims for Lynch, ’ he said... My husband worked at Brisbane Grammar School . We lived in a school -owned apartment on Gregory Terrace with my baby. I contended with the school’s coven which involved an English teacher and ground staff who targeted my daughter. They posed as a new church that I was invited to. My suspicions were aroused when the English teacher’s young obese daughter broke down in terror at a ‘church’ meeting, as though we were at a coven gathering. James Wood’s Sexist Conclusion In his Final Report, Royal Commissioner Wood concluded Ritual Abuse victims to be : ... nearly always women , who during therapy for a variety of personal problems, reveal previously unrecalled memories of bizarre childhood victimisation at the hands of multiple offenders, and who are frequently diagnosed as suffering from multiple personality disorder. The Australian victims documented in the above newspaper articles are male . Most of the Sydney pedophile network victims who contacted me are male . This contradicts Commissioner Wood’s sexist dismissal of Ritual Abuse victims as crazy, hysterical females. "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 75 Bill Heffernan Reiterates Twenty 20 years after the failed Wood Royal Commission , Senator Bill Heffernan raised the same concerns regarding VIP pedophile s: Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan says Former Prime Minister a Suspected Pedophile Jane Lee, Sydney Morning Herald, 21 October 2015. A former Australian prime minister is on a list of ‘alleged pedophiles ’ that Liberal senator Bill Heffernan claims forms part of a police document. Senator Heffernan used a Senate estimates committee hearing on Tuesday to discuss the list of 28 people, which he said formed part of police documents that had been ‘signed off ’ by Gary Crooke, QC, the former senior counsel assisting NSW’s Wood royal commission into police corruption in the 1990s. Mr Crooke declined to comment when contacted by Fairfax Media on Tuesday. Many of the people on the list and otherwise named in the documents were ‘prominent, ’ including a former prime minister, Senator Heffernan said: ‘They were delivered to me by a police agency some time ago because no one seems to want to deal with them.’ Every Commonwealth attorney-general since Philip Ruddock had seen the list, Senator Heffernan said... Senator Heffernan had shown the documents to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse but was told they were not part of its terms of reference . Proof Child Abuse Royal Commission is Corrupt The federal Child Abuse Royal Commission is a farce. It was implemented to gather information, coverup any evidence of Australia’s massive pedophile network, and give the public a false sense of security that something is being done t o remedy the child abuse epidemic. I can prove the Royal Commission is corrupt, with a single example . In 2015, the Royal Commission hired lawyer Gail Furness to assist them. That year, Gail Furness questioned both Gerald Ridsdale and George Pell. Gail Furness’ cross examination of George Pell in Rome was so poor, Australian lawyers noted, the most basic cr iminal lawyer could have performed better. Owing to her abysmal effort , George Pell escaped answering vital questions about his coverup of pedophile priests including Gerard Ridsdale . Gerard Ridsdale has been convicted of raping over 60 kids so far (a fraction of his estimated victim total). One incident involved Ridsdale raping a girl on a church altar, after the child ’s own father delivered her naked to the altar (an act which reeks of ritual abuse). Royal Commission Hides Pedophile Priest Network A Melbourne newspaper identified Gerard Ridsdale and numerous other priests as members of a massive pedophile network that shared victims across Victoria. 89 The article does not name George Pell as part of this network, when he certainly was. Hardly surprisin g, since 300 journalists were charged for revealing Pell’s conviction. The article states: 89 Farrah Tomazin, Chris Vedelago & Debbie Cuthbertson (2019). R evealed: How paedophile priests in Victoria worked together to share victims , The Age , 17 Sep."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 76 At the centre of a number of these networks was Melbourne’s seminary - Corpus Christi - which has produced about 1000 priests over almost 100 years, including jailed Cardinal George Pell and convicted child rapist Gerald Ridsdale. According to a conservative snapshot from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse, at least 75 convicted and alleged sex offenders emerged from Corpu s Christi. The true figure is not known . ... In a statement of claim which lawyers plan to file in court this week, the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, alleges Vears took him to the seminary in October 1976 and left him to wait in a communal living room with four or five other boys. A second priest, Ryan, then allegedly picked the boy from the group, took him back to a bedroom and sexually assaulted him . ‘I recall that seminarians would come out through the corridor into the sitting room and select a boy to go back with them ,’ said the former St Peter’s altar boy. The same thing occurring at St Alipius Presbytery , a single -story residence adjoining St Alipius parish school and St Alipius Catholic church in Ballarat, Victoria. . In 1972 to ‘73, Gerard Ridsdale, George Pell and a third priest lived together in St Alipius Presbytery . Gerard Ridsdale served as the St Alipius parish school chaplain. Four St Alipius school teachers and priests were outed as pedophiles: Robert Best, Edward Dowlan, Gerald Leo Fitzgerald, and Stephen Francis Farrell. All, except Fitzgerald (who could not stand trial because he was dead) were convicted of sex crimes. One of Ridsdale’s child rape victims disclosed being forced to procure more child victims from the school playground and lure them to the St Alipius presbytery to be sexually assaulted by priests. Gail Furness actively hid the existence of a pedophile ring in St Alipius presbytery as follows. Furness questioned Gerard Ridsdale about his violent rape of a 10/11-year-old girl in the St Alipius Presbytery kitchen, an incident which George Pell witnessed. A newspaper article accurately reported the facts of the crime as follows: JUDGE SLAMS CHURCH OVER PAEDOPHILE PRIEST SECRETS Padraic Murphy, Herald Sun , 9 April 2014 . A PRIEST [George Pell] who allegedly witnessed predatory pedophile Gerald Ridsdale raping a young girl 40 years ago has been slammed by a judge, but the clergyman’s identity has been withheld from the public. ... Ridsdale pleaded guilty on March 18 to the rape of the girl, then 10 or 11, at St Alipius presbytery, Ballarat, in 1972 or ’73. A summary of the court plea details: ‘In around 1972 or 1973 when (the victim) was aged 10 or 11 she was cutting up vegetables in the presbytery kitchen at the St Alipius Primary School. Ridsdale came in and said he had lots of shiny roc ks to show her. (The victim) remembers this was around the time of the VFL football grand final.’ The court heard that Ridsdale then took her into his room, and showed her adult magazines, and she ran back into the kitchen . When she ran he chased her, grabbed her, told her to bend over and then raped her. A summary said: ‘(She) believes that another priest [George Pell] living at the house at the time"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 77 walked through the door to the hallway and exited out the back door as this occurred. She knows that this priest [George Pell] saw what was happening ...’ Gail Furness misrepresented the content of the victim’s police witness statement and the facts of the case, and led the defendant, while questioning Gerald Ridsdale, by putting the following two blatant lies to Ridsdale: 1. The Presbytery was a two-story building that contained two upstairs bedrooms. 2. Gerald Ridsdale raped the victim in the privacy of his ‘upstairs’ bedroom. Prior to Gail Furness’ cross examination, Gerald Ridsdale had been charged, convicted and sentenced based on the following facts: 1. The presbytery is a single -story building, 2. Gerard Ridsdale raped the victim in the communal kitchen, not his private bedroom. So, Gail Furness moved the location of a child’s rape from a public to a private setting. Why? Because if the rape occurred in a public place, this suggests every priest in the presbytery was comfortable with pedophilia, and the only people comfortable with pedophilia – are pedophiles. It indicates the house was full of pedophile priests. Indeed, it later emerged that Cardinal George Pell was the priest who witnessed Ridsdale raping the girl in the kitchen, and that George Pell himself was a rampant pedophile. Hundreds of victims made police statements against Pell, yet the police only ran with one simple cas e. The Australian government has consistently covered up the true nature and extent of Pell’s crimes. The Australian government and the Royal Commission allowed Pell to leave the country knowing his crimes. The Australian government paid Gail Furness $5 million for her services to the Royal Commission. What the Wood Royal Commission Concealed My contact with multiple victims over five years enabled me to piece together the sealed contents of the Wood Royal Commission files. James Wood buried evidence of a CIA child trafficking operation where children were recruited for a human compromise racket and as MK -ULTRA experiments. Subjects were obtained through MK -ULTRA institutions including Hillsong Church and Daruk government boys’ home where they were subjected to ritual abuse and mind control. Daruk and Hillsong children were prostituted to venues like Club Costello boy brothel in Kellett Street, Kings Cross, frequented by prominent politicians, judges, police, entertainers and businessmen. Multiple victims of the Wood Royal Commission era pedophile network that Senator Heffernan referenced, named the following perpetrators: - Gough Whitlam (ALP Prime Minister , my pedophile rapist). - Bob Hawke (ALP Prime Minister, my pedophile rapist). - Kim Beazley Snr (ALP Minister , my pedophile rapist). - John Kerr (ALP appointed Governor General, my pedophile rapist). - Bob Carr (ALP politician who campaigned to lower the age of consent)."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 78 - Marcus Einfeld (Federal judge.

In 2018 Bert Newton made a bizarre reference to the pedophile antics of his TV star buddies Graham Kennedy and Don Lane during his TV Logie Awards speech: Graham Kennedy was always the sort of man who nurtured yo ung talent. He enjoyed giving young people a chance on television, he was a great mentor, he mentored a lot of young people. You knew if you went to his dressing room it was locked, he will be inside doing some mentoring. Don Lane was a mentor too. He did a hell of a lot of mentoring. Daruk and Engadine BoysTown Daruk government boys’ home was used to procure kids for sex trafficking to Club Costello boy brothel in Kings Cross . Tim Roy’s father, who sex trafficked his own sons to members of Sydney’s entertainment industry, worked at Daruk. At age 13, Stephen Masters was thrown into Daruk government boys’ home where he was subjected to ECT (electroc ution). Stephen publicly declared Daruk was a CIA research facility where boys were subjected to MK -ULTRA experiments involving circumcision, biochemical exposure, drugging, and electrocution. Stephen said boys (notably a child surnamed Rogan) were murdered by hanging and their deaths recorded as ‘suicide’ or ‘absconded.’ Victims’ bodies were disposed of in the coal furnace that heated Daruk. Stephen Masters believes Medical Officer John Munger headed the MK-ULTRA research conducted on Daruk boys. The Australian government is protecting the identity and whereabouts of John Munger who is not listed with the low-level Daruk perpetrators due to be prosecuted in early 2020. Police informed Stephen Masters that John Munger served in the Australian Navy, yet no photo is available of him. Daruk staff occupi ed a house on the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 79 street corner directly outside the Daruk entrance ; Stephen believes this was where the MK - ULTRA records were safely stored off-site. Stephen Master’s was incarcerated in Daruk with Les Murphy who, with four others including John Travers, was imprisoned for the 1986 ritual rape and murder of 26-year-old nurse Anita Coby. I say ‘ritual’ because I heard unpublished details of Anita’s murder from two unrelated sources who viewed Les Murphy’s file, the lawyer husband of my high school friend, a nd a prison guard I bunked with during my parole officer training in Sydney. The latter vomited when she read Murphy’s file detailing how he and his accomplices had sex with deep cuts they made in Anita’s body. Serial killer Ivan Milat’s victims were found chopped up and scattered over a wide area of bushland, which indicates satanic ritual. I surmise that Milat was the fall guy for a group cult effort. Stephen Masters reported two encounters with Ivan Milat to police. The first involved Milat offer ing 15-year-old Stephen and his inebriated teenage mate a lift . Milat detoured to Club Costello boy brothel in Kings Cross where Stephen recognised 16-year-old Les Murphy working behind the bar. Stephen deduced Ivan Milat drugged and raped his young mate in Milat’s car that evening , and that that Milat had a system of scouting and collecting child victims, drugging them in preparation for rape by pedophiles at Club Costello, before disposing of the ir bodies afterwards. Both Ivan Milat and John Travers (Anita Coby’s killer) spent time in Engadine ’s BoysTown juvenile detention facility , where my father and I were subjected to years of ritual abuse. Australians question where the likes of Milat, Murphy and Travers got the idea to murder people the way they did. Such behaviour is not innate - it was taught by Luciferian pedophiles who ran Engadine BoysTown and Daruk. We will never know how many murders Milat and Murphy committed separately or together. The unsolved 1965 Wanda beach murders where two 15-year-old girls violently stabbed and slashed at Cronulla carried all the hallmarks of Ivan Milat. Milat, Marsden & Murphy John Marsden was Ivan Milat’s lawyer. In 1971 , Marsden secured Ivan Milat bail for rape and armed robbery charges and helped him flee to New Zealand. Australian authorities allowed Milat to leave the country knowing he was on bail for serious offences. I wonder how many NZ victims Milat sourced, abducted and killed for the NZ VIP pedophile network I heard about from NZ victims and witnesses. When Milat returned to Australia in 1974 , John Marsden had him acquitted of the rape and armed robbery charges. Milat was never charged for breaching his bail conditions by leaving Australia. My father knew the Milat brothers who told him they were never caught for a series of bank robberies during which they routinely raped young female bank tellers. Daruk resident Ray Leary was sex trafficked to Club Costello boy brothel where he was raped by John Marsden. 90 Ray Leary also witnessed Les Murphy working behind the bar at Club Costello, and said John Marsden used Les Murphy, whom Marsden frequently visited in prison, to threaten him.

Premiere Bob Carr subsequently introduced his NSW Age of Conse nt Bill in 2003.

The following newspaper articles refer to this operation: POLICE FILES ON SEX ABUSE ‘VANISHED’ Gary Hughes, The Age, 19 April 2004. Police files on a suspect in claimed sexual abuse by men dressed as police are said to have ‘disappeared.’ A deputy principal who reported a student’s claim of the abuse says detectives later told him that Victoria Police computer files on one of the alleged pedophiles were tampered with. He was also told his initial report to the Department of Human Services under the mandatory reporting system disappeared. The 13-year -old boy told staff at the school he had been repeatedly sexually abused by a number of men on the Mornington Peninsula. He said some of the men wore police uniforms and warned him that they would know if he reported the abuse because they were policemen. The boy had also been used to produce c hild pornography later published overseas. The deputy principal said it was clear from a detailed 12 -page statement made by the boy that the abuse was conducted by an organised and ‘well -connected’ pedophile ring. No charges were laid because police said the boy had been ‘too well groomed’ by the pedophiles and it was doubtful he would testify in court. The deputy principal contacted The Age after it revealed this month that the Ombudsman was investigating the alleged mishandling of a number of child sexual abuse cases by Victoria Police . The Age advised him to contact the Ombudsman, which he has since done. One case being reviewed by the Ombudsman involves children at a child-care centre in Mornington . Investigators have been told that a house where the alleged abuse took place possibly belonged to a policeman and that a videotape existed of children from the centre being abused by men dressed as police . The deputy principal from the college in Melbourne’s outer east has asked that neither he nor the college be named to protect the identity of the abused boy. The deputy principal, who has since become principal of another school, lodged an initial report with what was then Community Services Victoria in July 1995. He telephoned about two weeks later and was told the report was being investigated. The deputy principal"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 83 said it was clear from a statement made by the boy that the abuse was conducted by an organised pedophile ring . After the boy made more detailed disc losures and began displaying disturbing behaviour, the school lodged a second mandatory report in December 1995 through the Education Department’s regional office. The complaint was taken ‘very seriously’ and police were called. The deputy principal said police told him there was no record of the original report to community services or his follow -up phone call. A senior child protection manager told him it was not the first time reports had disappeared . Detectives from a community policing unit said the main alleged offender in the ring was well known to police, the deputy principal said. But the police said a previous case against him had been abandoned after information on police files had disappeared. ‘I started to pinch myself and think is this re al or not? It seemed quite bizarre and I was very frustrated...’ he said. After police dropped the investigation in 1996 the boy ‘totally clammed up’ and staff at the school did not know whether the abuse continued. A Victoria Police spokesman said the original allegation had been investigated, including a search of the main suspect’s home that found no incriminating evidence. The boy involved had refu sed to repeat to police the disclosures he had earlier made to school staff. The spokesman said he was not aware that files had disappeared. * * * CALL FOR PROBE INTO POLICE INVESTIGATION Matt Doran, Mornington Peninsula Leader , 4 May 2004. AT 7am on an ordinary morning in the early 1990s, police rapped on the door of a house in Mt Martha, waiting to tell a mother and a father their two toddlers were believed to have been victims of pedophilia. They did it subtly, of course, by asking the parents to se e if their children had ever heard of ‘red Kenny’ or ‘Daddy Kenny.’ A number of children from a Mornington childcare centre had earlier told the police these were nicknames used by men who had sexually abused them. ‘I will never forget the look on my daughter’s face when she heard those names. She immediately ran behind her mother saying ‘save me mummy, save me,’ said John (not his real name). John was later told by his eldest daughter that the same men had held her underwater and bent her little finger backwards if she didn’t do as she was told. John knew in his heart then that the bruises on his youngest daughters’ cheek had not been caused by a ‘playground accident.’ His children, ‘two little heroes,’ were among at least 16 others abused at the Mornington Child Care Centre and Nursery School in the 1990s. Children told police and their parents they were taken from the centre in a van to a house in Mornington where they were sexually and physically abused by a group of adults. Some described being abused by adults wearing ‘funny clothes’ including police uniforms, clown suits and ‘black capes with tails.’"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 84 The centre was deregistered after a Department of Human Services inquiry found that the centre’s owners, Norman and Alison Shulver, had ‘permitted the abuse to occur or were involved in that abuse.’ No police charges were laid, but in 1994 the Crimes Compensation Tribunal awarded damages of up to $20,000 to more than 30 applicants affected by the alleged abuse. Now a decade later, Victoria’s Ombudsman is due to release a report on the way police handled their investigation. But that does not comfort John or his eldest daughter, now 16, who are still traumatised. ‘My eldest daughter still needs counselling and is afraid to sleep by herself. She is on antidepressants and . . . has no friends,’ John said. ‘She believes she was the victim of organised pedophilia and she still fears for her life. ‘It is too late for justice for my family. Justice cannot repair my marriage or make up for the trauma my daughter has suffered. But there needs to be justice for the community, so that people’s faith in the system can be restored.’ Psychologist Dr Reina Michaelson, who is representing survivors of abuse throughout Victoria, helped instigate the Ombudsman’s investigat ion in 2002. She first raised concerns with Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon in 2001, about the way the original police investigation was conducted after a ‘well-hidden’ file containing allegations linking police to child sex offences was stolen from her home. But now Dr Michaelson has lost faith in the Ombudsman’s internal investigation. Documents obtained by the Leader show that in April last year an Ethical Standards Department officer was removed from the investigation for ‘incompetence’ after he failed to pass on vital information from two witnesses. One witness claimed that a house used by pedophiles in Mornington belonged to a policeman. The other witness gave information about the existence of a video tape that showed a number of men dressed in police uniforms abusing children. The investigator said he could not recall talking about a video with the witness, but a check of telephone records showed he did have such a conversation. ‘These children were the victims of a highly organised and protected pedophile group that continues to operate throughout Victoria,’ Dr Michaelson said. ‘W hile this type of corruption continues, these children don’t have a hope of getting justice. ‘They desperately want to present their testimonies and evidence, but they need to be given a forum where they can do this in safety and where the investigative pr ocess is truly independent. Doctor’s Years of Dedication Dr Reina Michaelson, who sparked the Ombudsman's current investigation, is a high achiever in the world of child psychology. The 33 -year -old completed her PhD in psychology at Victoria University in 2001. Her thesis, which was awarded the vice - chancellor's medal for excellence in research, focused on ways to prevent child sexual abuse. Dr Michaelson was Young Australian of the Year (for community service) in 2001.

Reina Michaelson, head of the Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program, and Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnston said victims had told them of an organised child pornography an d prostitution network with links to former MPs and senior police officers. The claims a pedophile ring was operating under the protection of police came after the Victorian Ombudsman released a damning report on the conduct of four child sex abuse investigations, leading to a review of the operations of the sexual crimes squad. Two experienced members of the squad will be investigated over their role in the abuse cases, which are being reopened. The inquiry found the officers failed to adequately examine several child abuse allegations and concluded they may have lied under oath to investigators from the Ombudsman’s office. The Ombudsman found officers from the squad told the Education Department a teacher had been cleared of abuse allegations, despite conducting no investigation into the claims . In a separate case, a senior detective blamed a 12-year-old girl for encouraging a man who had allegedly abused her, and another officer described the victim as ‘a little slut .’ The Ombudsman’s inquiry followed complaints from Dr Michaelson, who gave a dossier of child abuse cases she claimed had been mishandled to police Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon in late 2001. . . * * * [Bert Newton] TV M AN LINKED TO SEX CASE INQUIRY The Age , 16 Nov 2004 . A sudden decision by Victoria Police to drop a rape investigation involving a prominent television industry figure is likely to be examined as part of a special inquiry by the state Ombudsman into how authorities handle sexual assault cases. Using his new powers, the Ombudsman will examine how government agencies and the police investigate allegations of sexual assault and how victims are treated. The wide-ranging inquiry will include the Department of Education and the Department of Human Services, which is responsible for child protectio n. "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 86 One of the cases likely to be examined is the recent decision by Victoria Police to drop an investigation into sexual assault allegations against the prominent Victorian television industry figure . The al leged victim told police in March that he was repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted as a teenager by the male television executive in the 1980s. Deputy Ombudsman John Taylor told The Age a special unit began initial work on the inquiry several weeks ag o and government agencies had been formally notified. ... The alleged victim of the television figure lodged a formal complaint last week with the Ombudsman and Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon about the decision to drop the investigation. The Ombudsman had already decided to hold the special inquiry before the complaint was received. Ms Nixon has referred the complaint to the police Ethical Standards Department. The Ombudsman has been told that police decided to drop the cas e, despite the Office of Public Prosecutions reviewing the evidence just weeks earlier and indicating the investigation should proceed and charges could be laid. In his complaint to the Ombudsman, the alleged victim said that police ignored potentially cor roborative evidence, failed to interview witnesses, only spoke to some other witnesses over the telephone and pressured him into writing a letter exonerating a second offender just a week before dropping the case. Mr Taylor said the decision to hold the special inquiry was the result of the number of complaints received over the past 12 months about the way sexual abuse allegations had been handled by government agencies and the police. ‘Inevitably the focus has been as the result of some specific complaints, but we are looking more broadly than just a few complaints, ’ he said. ... The new inquiry comes after an Ombudsman's investigation into police mishandling of child sexual abuse cases was scathing in its criticism of Victoria Police in July. Police reopened four cases after the Ombudsman found investigations had been bungled. The Age revealed at the time that, in one of the cases, children had remained at risk in a country town after police inadequately investigated an alleged pedophile in 1999. The two-year investigation by the Ombudsman was also highly critical of the attitudes of investigating officers. One senior sexual crimes squad detective blamed a 12 -year- old schoolgirl for leading on a 63 -year-old man who allegedly abused her. Another police officer told investigators the same girl was a ‘slut,’ despite admitting she had most likely been sexually abused. The sexual crimes squad was also found to have failed to investigate allegations against a teacher, but told the Education Department th at investigations had been carried out and the teacher cleared. * * * "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 87 CULT FIGHTS CLAIMS OF CHILD SACRIFICE Barney Zwarts, The Age, 22 November 2006. An anti-child-sex campaigner accused an occult religious group of hosting parties at which naked children acted as waiters and at which members had sex with and murdered children, a tribunal was told yesterday. The obscure group Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) claims Dr Reina Michaelson and the Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program described it in a website article as a satanic cult that sacrificed children and ate their organs and blood. It has complained under Victoria’s religious hatred law that Dr Michaelson and her organisation vilified OTO members, causing revulsion, ridicule, hatred and contempt. According to OTO’s statement of complaint, Dr Michaelson said it was not a religion but a child pornography and pedophile ring, that its members practised trauma -based mind control, sexual abuse and satanic rituals to discourage its victims from complaining to the authorities, and that it condoned kidnapping street children and babies and children from orphanages for sex and sacrifice in religious rituals. The case began at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal yesterday but was adjourned to today to allow a last -ditch attempt to settle out of court. The article, still accessible on a website run from NSW, suggests senior politicians and television celebrities are part of a top-level pedophile ring and have been protected by some police. It says some members of the ring pretended to support Dr Michaelson’s campaign and became board members of her group to subvert it from within. . . OTO members follow a religion known as Thelema, founded by occultist Aleister Crowley. * * * Dr Reina Michaelson’s Testimony The following document was posted by David Icke and on various websites including Above Top Secret . The public reinserted some of the names that Reina Michaelson disguised. Dr Michaelson’s Statement: The following is a summary of events that detail the infiltration of a high -profile, powerful group of child sex offenders into my child abuse prevention organisation. What was uncovered as a result of this infiltration was the existence of a child pornography and pedophile ring that is operating in Aust ralia, under the protection of senior -ranking members of Victoria Police. The members of the network include senior management and executives from a major television network, media celebrities, high-ranking politicians, police officers in charge of pedophile and child pornography investigations, senior management representatives from the Department of Education, directors of ‘child-focused’ service clubs, wealthy businessmen, and others."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 88 I have tried to keep the account as brief as possible while including all relevant information. The description covers events from 1995 until the time of this writing (2005). Names have been changed. Victorian Department of Education Protects Rushmore Pedophile Teacher In 1995, I started running Australia's first child sexual abuse prevention program in schools (CSAPP, Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program). This school-based program teaches children how to protect themselves from sexual abuse and what to do if someone tries to sexually abuse them. The program also teaches adults how they can best protect children under their care from sexual abuse. My assistant and I were at Rushworth high school in the northern region working with Year 9 boys. We received a note written anonymously by one of the boys asking, ‘What do you do if you get raped by a teacher and no one will believe you? What happens if you get raped and you enjoy it?’ Later during that day, we were asked exactly the same question by a boy who was flushed red with embarrassment. I replied, ‘Talk to the Student Welfare Coordinator,’ to which he replied, ‘What if he is the one who won't believe you?’ I emphasized that it is important to keep te lling until someone believes you. During the day my assistant and I noticed the strange behaviour of a Rushworth teacher. Later that afternoon I learnt that the car I had been driving had been rammed in the school's carpark. Witnesses reported that the car had been rammed deliberately by a man who then drove off very quickly. The local police were called and ran a licence check on the car and discovered that the numberplate was fake. They then took photos of the crime scene using the school's camera. Later, when it was revealed that a teacher was under suspicion of sexually abusing the children at the school and then organising the ramming of my car to intimidate me, the photos went ‘missing,’ and no further action was taken. The Rushworth teacher was the only person at the school who knew my car, as he had taken it upon himself to show me to my car to give me directions to the shops during a break in classes. It was organised that the boys in Year 9 would be interviewed in order to find the victims and give them appropriate support. Three people (including myself, my assistant and a counsellor from a sexual assault centre) were responsible for conducting the interviews. At the completion of the interviews, there were concerns for approximately 12 of the boys. These concerns related specifically to sexual assault by a teacher at the school. However, by this stage (over a week had passed since the initial program) it was clear that the boys had been threatened. For example, when I interviewed the boy who had as ked the questions about sexual abuse by a teacher and not being believed, he huddled into a foetal position, started crying, and said he could not tell me what happened. When I asked him why he couldn't tell me, he replied that he had been threatened with his life. His best friend told me he would never tell what had happened. Sometime after this, we organised a theatre company performance for the students (on the topic of sexual abuse). While the children were seated and waiting for the play to begin, the offending teacher made an unscheduled visit to the hall. He proceeded to stand in"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 89 front of each of the boys we had identified as potential victims and stare them down. The boys, who had been happy and laughing in the excitement of waiting for the play to b egin, went grey with fear. Finally, I stood in front of the pedophile teacher so that he could not intimidate the boys any further. I was then told no further action would be taken as the boys had not named the offender. Program Infiltrated I was the recipient of a very prestigious national award (Young Australian of the Year for Community Service ). One of the judges (’RS’) was a well -connected government official, and another was Robert Osmotherly, a Network 10 TV executive. Network 10 General Manager After winning this award, Robert Osmotherly approached me and said that he had never heard of this terrible crime (child sexual abuse) before meeting me. He said wanted to help me get my program into every school in Victoria within five years and said he had the money and the connections to do this. He said he would raise half a million dollars in 6 weeks, and have it matched within 6 months. He said that he and RS would set my program up as an independent organisation and that they would establish a Board of Management consisting of all of their powerful and influential friends. RS would become President of the organisation and Robert Osmotherly Vice -President. I agreed to Robert Osmotherly’ s proposal as it sounded as if he would enable the program to receive substantial funding and therefore be able to reach many more children within Victoria, and across Australia. I did not consider for a second that Robert Osmotherly and RS could have been deceiving me in order to get control of, and ultimately, to destroy the child sexual abuse prevention program that I had developed. The Board members and supporters that they brought to the organisation were very powerful and from the highest echelons of society. These included the Editor -in Chief of a major Australian newspaper, the former head of a child -focussed service club, the head of the largest agricultural society in Victoria, the partner from a well -known law firm, an extremely wealthy businessman and former Network 10 board member, the head of a well-known accounting firm, the head of a successful advertising company, and others. Despite having such wealth and powerful connections, in the two -year period that they served on the Board they organised only one donation of $25,000. The board members subsequently despised the donor and ostracised him from their community (which at the time I thought was incredibly ungrateful!). This is compared with over $200,000 my family and I raised doing the fundra ising ourselves in the same time period! Furthermore, my efforts to secure funding were being actively sabotaged. For example, after an interview on the Channel 9 'Today' show (not Network 10), I was contacted by a well- known multi-national company who said that they would like to fund my program. This well- known company was located in Sydney, and as Robert Osmotherly frequently went to Sydney, I asked if he would have a meeting with them on behalf of our organisation. He agreed. However, when he returned from the meeting, he said for me not to have much hope and not to contact them for six months while they sorted out a new tax issue. I found this very"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 90 odd, as they had been so keen to fund the organisation when I had spoken to the m. I phoned the woman whom I had spoken to, and she confirmed my suspicions. She had been at the meeting and Robert Osmotherly had told the company not to bother funding us, as ‘the organisation won't be around in six months. ’ Needless to say, we did not receive the funding. During this time period, I was without any income for four months. Many other people would have quit and sought other employment ; however, I believed passionately in my cause and did not give up, much to the chagrin of Robert Osmotherly. On one occasion he said to me, ‘You have given so much to this cause in your life, why don't you just give up? You have achieved more good in your short life than many do in a long life -time. Why don't you retire down in the country (I was 28 years old). Go on, just give up.’ When I replied that I would never give up, he stormed away! I was confused by this behaviour, but as I trusted him , I did not think too much more about it at the time. The Board members achieved one other ‘in-kind’ donation. It was the use of a Honda CRV vehicle. I appreciated the use of the vehicle while I had it (approximately 18 months). However, I later discovered that the head of the company that donated it, a close friend of RS, had just been convicted of child sex offences. These offences included the production of child pornography. RS organised a meeting with TF, the CEO of a major charitable trust and personal f riend of his and other members of the Board. At that meeting I was amazed when TF asked me , ‘ Do you ever think that by preventing children from having sexual relationships with adults that you are actually HARMING them ?’ I replied by citing the research that strongly indicates adult -child sexual relationships are harmful to children, but he had switched his mind off to my argument. He then stated that in 100 years or so it will be revealed that such relationships are not harmful but that what I was doing wa s harmful to children. I was certainly taken aback and R S said, ‘Don't worry, TF just thinks on a very high intellectual plane. High above yours.’ Needless to say, we didn't get funding from RS's very good friend after all. Meeting with Victorian Premiere Jeff Kennett After winning the award, I had a meeting with a very powerful state politician, Jeff Kennett. At that time, Jeff Kennett was the most powerful person in the state. As well as being politically powerful he also had key business interests, including in the m edia. When I was first introduced to him, he was staring at me quite sleazily. After he asked what work I do, and my response ‘child abuse prevention, ’ he would not make eye contact at all and sought to exclude me from the meeting in a very bullying manner . It was well-known that Jeff Kennett was a serious domestic violence offender, and that his wife was frequently being admitted to shelters in secret . However, given the power and status of Mr Kennett the issue was never raised in the mainstream media. I was later to be informed by a very reliable and trusted source from the child welfare field that there is a file containing serious child sex offences (against boys) by Jeff Kennett, but because of his enormous power in Victoria, the police would not act on it . I also discovered from a former sex worker that Jeff Kennett frequently paid St Kilda boy sex workers for sex, and that one of these boys ‘talked too much to the wrong people and ended up dead with an 'accidental' heroin overdose. ’"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 91 It was also alleged that Jeff Kennett intentionally abused the boys in unusual situations (for example, in a helicopter) so that if it ever got out, the boys' testimonies would seem unbelievable . This of , course, is exactly the same strategy used by offenders in the US child-care centre cases. Interestingly, Jeff Kennett has recently commissioned a statue of himself - as a gargoyle [on St Patrick's Cathedral 92 ]. Later I met with another politician (from the same Liberal Party) who told me that ‘Jeff Kennett is really into that (child sex abuse).’ This same politician told me that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the police were ‘getting too close to the truth, too close to people in high positions of power who are also pedophiles ,’ and so the sex crimes squad’s child expl oitation unit had been established to investigate organised pedophilia and ensure it was shut down . (Soon after Detective Senior Sergeant Chris O’Connor was put in charge of the child exploitation unit and the sexual crimes squad, to investigate these offences and ensure that the truth never got out and that this high -ranking network of offenders would never get caught). Network 10 Produces Pornography One day I was working on a computer at Network 10. As I was working, Robert Osmotherly approached my computer and put a floppy disk in the machine. He said, ‘Look at this ’ and proceeded to bring up images of pornography involving humans and Sesame Street characters . I was very embarrassed and did not know how to react. I asked, ‘Where did you get that?’ and he replied , ‘Oh, someone put it together here,’ indicating that Network 10 was producing pornography. I was later to discover that Network 10 is also producing child pornography and is, in fact, a cult-owned and run television station. I was also later to discover that Robert Osmotherly is a passionate member of a cult. Robert Osmotherly introduces me to Mr. Television After winning the abovementioned award, I was invited to go on one of the morning television shows on Network 10. (This was before my association with Robert Osmotherly. Ironically, after my association with Robert Osmotherly, Network 10 did not do any promotion of my work at all!) It is hosted by one of the most famous and longest serving televi sion personalities in Australia, Bert Newton. I was asked to prepare a number of questions that Bert Newton would ask me. I prepared very straight-forward questions that focussed on the work, so I was quite shocked when Bert Newton glared at me and said, ‘Are you doing this because it happened to you? ’ I was also stunned when he refused to allow the phone number of my organisation to be presented on the air for donations. When I later became closely associated with Network 10 Robert Osmotherly would often say to me ‘You know, Bert Newton really likes you. He really likes you! ’ This surprised me because my experience of Bert Newton had been the exact opposite of that. (Interestingly, Robert Osmotherly also frequently said to me , ‘Jeff Kennett really likes me since I started 92 The Age , It's Kennett the gargoyle . 7 June 2002."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 92 helping you. He has me sit next to him at all of the formal functions we attend now.’ This was indeed true, Jeff Kennett, Robert Osmotherly and ‘ RS’ were all the best of friends.) After my experience with Network 10, I subsequently discovered that in the late 1980's Bert Newton was frozen out of the television industry due to allegations of his involvement in the production of child pornography. Although his alleged involvement in this activity was well-publicised at the time, he was never charged and about a year later he joined Network 10. Since then he has continued to play a significant role in the production of child pornography in Australia. One contact who works on the set of the morning program hosted by Bert Newton finds the work to be very distressing as other on -air talent are very open about their pedophilia . This contact is disgusted, as his sister is a victim of child sex offences, however he does not want to publicly disclose the information as he will lose his job. In addition to the above, I am now in contact with a boy who was paid $2000 a night to have sex with Bert Newton, from the ages of 15 - 18 years. Introduction to the Pedophile Police Unit There is a specialised police unit in Victoria that, since the early 1990's, is responsible for investigating all child sex offences involving multiple -victims, offences committed by teachers, as well as child pornography offences [the Child Exploitation Unit within the Sexual Crimes Squad] . I had a meeting with the head of this unit, Detective Senior Sergeant Chris O’Connor , and was very surprised when the first thing he said to me was ‘Does Jeff Kennett know about your program? Jeff Kennett should know about your program. ’ I found this a very odd thing for him to say as an opening statement, and especially so, given the information known about Jeff Kennett's alleged sexual abuse of boys. I thought it impossible for this police officer not to know of these things, given his specialist role. Relationship between Chris O’Connor and network 10 Robert Osmotherly I subsequently became aware of the ‘unusual’ relationship between Chris O’Connor (police) and Robert Osmotherly (Network 10) . I invited Chris O’Connor to do a presentation for the board members. RS was ‘so impressed’ by Chris O’Connor that he wanted to invite him onto the Board of Management (along with all the other pedophile members). I later discovered that Chris O’Connor and Robert Osmotherly, although pretending not to know each other at the Board meeting, have a very cosy relationship indeed. Specifically, a couple of years ago, a senior staff member at Network 10 was charged with procuring children for prostitution . At the time, the wife of a detective working in Chris O’Connor' s unit (Pam Cullen ) received a very sudden and significant promotion to become Robert Osmotherly 's Personal Assistant . It was a clear conflict of interest and deeply comprising to the investigation. Pam Cullen 's husband should not have been involved in investigating Network 10 staff for their involvement in procuring children for prostitution or any other child sex offences connected to Network 10. However, with the appointment of the detective's wife to Personal Assistant of the General Manager of Network 10, it was guaranteed that no other information pertaining to Network 10's illegal activities involving sex offences against children would be"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 93 pursued by Chris O’Connor or his unit. And Pam Cullen enjoyed her unexpected and incredibly well-paid, new position at Network 10. Chris O’Connor called in to investigate the Rushworth teacher and other offences In 1999 fresh allegations were made against the Rushworth pedophile teacher. This time, teenage girls reported the Rushworth pedophile teacher approaches students and asks them to meet him after school to meet 'Winston the Baseball Bat'. They indicated that 'Winston' was the teacher’s penis. They reported that other students were very affected by this behaviour, and some had taken to writing warn ings to each-other on the desks, such as ‘If the teacher asks you to meet Winston, don't do it – it’s his dick!!’ At last, the Rushworth pedophile teacher had been named and the victims were prepared to come forward. The teacher admitted to these offences and received 5 sessions of counselling. I then discovered the teacher had conveniently taken up a temporary position in a country school (like a priest being moved from parish to parish when things get too hot). The principal at the original school had not told the new school the circumstances surrounding his transfer and had instead said, ‘Poor teacher, he's had a difficult time lately.’ I later discovered that this Principal was an expert liar and had gone over and above the call of duty in protecting this pedophile teacher. At this new country high school it was not long before further allegations of child abuse by the Rushworth teacher came out. Incidents of verbal abuse, such as calling students ‘fucking stupid’ were revealed, as well as physical assaults, such as dragging students out of the classroom and throwing them on the floor. In another physical assault, the Rushworth pedophile teacher grabbed the 12-year -old boy by the neck and held him by his neck against a wall. The teacher admitted to the latter assault, wrote a letter of apology and provided financial compensation for the loss of the necklace. With the pedophile teacher being named and various offences being admitted to, I reported his behaviour for criminal investigation to Chris O’Connor's sex crimes unit. It also provided the opportunity for the 1995 offences to be re -investigated. However, Chris O’Connor interviewed only two of the 12 boys on the list from 1995 and reported to me that as the first two boys did not disclose anything, the ot hers would not be interviewed. In relation to the offences against the teenage girls, Chris O’Connor said that, at 15 years of age, the girls were ‘too young, ’ and he did not want to distress the girls' families by bringing up the topic of child sexual abuse. Therefore, these offences by the pedophile teacher would not be investigated either. I could not believe what I was hearing! Child sex offences are offence s because they happen against children! And at 15, the victims were hardly at the young end of the age -spectrum! It was a completely nonsensical reason for not investigating the pedophile . As for the physical assaults, Chris O’Connor said that he was not responsible for such investigations, so those cases would not be pursued either. He said , ‘You do understand, don't you! ’ (it was not a question) and I replied that I did not. However, Chris O’Connor was not prepared to discuss the situation amicably and the pedophile teacher evaded investigation, by both the police in the unit established to investigate such offences, and by the Department of Education. "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 94 Further Dealings with Chris O’Connor’s Child Exploitation Unit Whilst at the country school, disclosures of child sexual abuse by other offenders were made by many children. The disclosures centred on two offenders in the town. The specialised Child Exploitation Unit arrived to ‘investigate.’ However, the main victim of the sexual abuse, Sammy, a 12-year -old girl, did not attend school that day. Sammy did arrive after school that day on her bike, and her face was visibly disfigured. I was told by her best friend that she had been bashed, but her friend would not tell m e who did this to Sammy. Her smashed-in face was warning enough for all of the children. The police later went to her house, where she fainted upon seeing them. She did not disclose any abuse at all. Despite the fact that her face was visibly disfigured an d swollen from a recent assault, the police did not pursue the matter further. The specialised Child Exploitation Unit totally destroyed any chance of the truth being revealed and the victims receiving the justice they deserved. For example, they left children waiting all day to be interviewed and did not end up interviewing many of them, including witnesses to attempted child-rapes. The Child Exploitation Unit did interview one 12 -year -old victim ( ‘Lucy’) and totally intimidated her . When the girl indicated that the police didn't believe her the first time she told them what had happened to her, one police officer lent right over the top of her, pointed his finger directly in her face and hissed ‘Don't say that! You don't know that!’ I was shaking, and I was an adult sitting next to the girl! As she walked out of the interview room, the police officer said in voice loud enough for the girl to hear, ‘We have serious concerns about the truth of what this girl is saying.’ It had the desired effect, Lucy burst into tears and said, ‘The police don't believe me. I don't want to keep going.’ The Welfare Co -ordinator, who was also in the room during the interview, and who is also an experienced sexual assault counsellor and child protection officer, said to me , ‘That wasn't an interview. That was designed to stop a child from talking.’ The Child Exploitation Unit did not pursue the case any further on the following grounds: No-one would believe Sammy if she disclosed the abuse in the future, as she hadn't disclosed the first time. (The fact that she had been bashed would not be seen as relevant to her hesitancy to disclose?!) Lucy had le d all the children on (to make up ‘stories’ of sexual abuse for fun, even though the children were visibly traumatised). In relation to the sexual abuse of a boy, they said, ‘men try to touch other men's penises after football matches all the time ’ so it was not worthy of pursuing. And finally, the Child Exploitation Unit claimed that there was not enough evidence - this is despite the fact that there were witnesses to the attempted rapes of the children, and the testimonies of many victims provided significant corroboration. Also, many adults reported having been sexually abused by the same offenders when they were children, but the police refused to interview these adults. The Case is Stonewalled by Child Exploitation Unit head Chris O’Connor The police recommended that the Welfare Co-ordinator make reports to DOCS (Child Protection Department) as they stated it was a ‘protective issue, not a criminal one.’ The Welfare Co -ordinator did this, but weeks passed and the children were not interviewe d , and"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 95 she inquired as to why. She was informed that DOCS would not be taking any further action ‘on the advice of the police .’ So, after telling the Welfare Co-ordinator to take the case to DOCS for investigation, the Police effectively stone -walled the investigation by advising Child Protection not to investigate. Relationship between Robert Osmotherly & Chris O’Connor During the two-year association I had with Robert Osmotherly, ‘DS’ and the Board of Management that they had established, I trusted them implicitly. Although incidents occurred that often left me confused, and often baffled, and of -course, frequently without funding, I continued to trust them. DS always said to me ‘ I'm here to help.’ It was his favourite saying. I therefore reported all of the events that had occurred at the northern secondary school and the Rushworth school, to Robert Osmotherly. Osmotherly then told me that he knew Detective Senior Sergeant Chris O’Connor (in contrast to his earlier pretence of not knowing him at all!). He stated that Chris O’Connor is a ‘really good bloke. ’ However, when I spelt out the stonewalling of the Rushworth case, Robert Osmotherly 's face twitched and he became visibly uncomfortable. I had never seen Robert Osmotherly react in this way. It was soon after this that very strange events began to occur. On one occasion Robert Osmotherly was on the phone to his ‘boss’ (of Network 10). When his boss real ized that I was present he began to speak aggressively, not knowing that I could hear him. He was saying, ‘put her on the phone to me, I'll sort her out! ’ Of course, I found this all to be very strange as I had never even met this man before. However, when Robert Osmotherly apologised on behalf of his boss, I accepted it and put it out of my mind - again, because at that time I trusted him. I had recently purchased a very cheap country property that I planned to use as a retreat for abused children. I invit ed the board members to view the site. None attended, however Robert Osmotherly said that he wanted to go - alone with me. He said he had set aside the whole day for it and was putting me under enormous pressure to go with him. I felt very uncomfortable about it as he had insisted on a number of details. First, it had to be a complete secret. I wasn't even allowed to tell my parents that I was going, let alone where I was going. Second, he had to drive. I wasn't even allowed to drive my car to the station and for us to drive together from there (my car had to stay at my unit carpark). And third, Robert Osmotherly insisted on picking me up from my unit before daybreak. This was unnecessary as the trip only takes two -hours. Of course, all of these bizarre ‘conditions’ and the huge pressure that Robert Osmotherly was putting me under made me feel extremely wary. With my parents' help I made up an excuse at the very last minute and did not go. However, if I had done as Robert Osmotherly had wanted and if anything had happened to me that day, I could have gone missing without a trace. Sammy's relationship to Network 10 ‘Sammy, ’ the 12-year -old-girl from Rushworth, was a main victim of the sexual abuse being perpetrated against children in the town. She referred to the offender (a man in his 60's) as her ‘boyfriend, ’ and her close friends knew of the sexual activities between her and the man. The offender also happened to be the best friend of her father."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 96 I was asked to provide support to Sammy, and in one session it became apparent that Sammy's personality had been totally fragmented. In her words, she was like ‘a house with mirrors everywhere, smashed into broken bits.’ It was later that I learned about the use by powerful secret societies of trauma-based mind control, sexual abuse and satanic ritual to force children to create ‘alter personalities.’ Other information from Sammy has led me to believe that she has been subjected to all these forms of abuse. Sammy also told me that her relative takes her to Queensland (Australia) ‘whenever I want ’ and that she can get ‘whatever I want, too.’ It was only later that I learned of the immense significance of what Sammy was telling me. Sammy's relative is a Board member of Network 10, who is based in Queensland. It is my belief that Sammy was being used in Network 10's production of child pornography, both in Victoria and Queensland. Here is another example of the police's failure to investigate a case with ominous connections to Network 10. In particular, Detective Senior Sergeant Chris O’Connor’s unit that has been established specifically and exclusively to investigate such cases well and truly ensured that this case would go nowhere. After two sessions with Sammy I was told that the school had ‘received complaints’ that I had ‘ brainwashed the children ’ and the support sessions were terminated. More Connections - the Cult in Rushworth I was to learn later that there is a Satanic cult operating in Rushworth . I learned this from two independent sources. One was from a Christian woman who was raised in the town and who since had moved elsewhere. The other was from an adult survivor of the cult, Mick. The Satanic cult is very powerful within the town and was headed up by the most powerful and influential families of the town. One of the members owned and operated the photographic studio in the town. Furthermore, Jeff Kennett, the powerful politician mentioned previously, has significant ‘business operations’ extremely close to Rushworth , and he was driven (by his driver) to this location every week . Mick's Experiences ‘Mick’ was introduced to the satanic cult as a very young child by an extended relative. Mick informed me of many experiences he was subjected to as a child in this cult. From everything that I have been told by Mick, the cult appears to be the Illuminati operating in Australia. Mick now suffers from MPD/DID but has survived his experiences remarkably well considering the traumas he has been through. As a child Mick was forced to attend blood -rituals, where animals and small children were sacrificed, and their blood and organs consumed. Mick was required to clean up the blood after these rituals. The children and babies were street children or were taken from orphanages, so that they could not be traced and no -one would know, or care, if they went missing. The rituals were spoken in Latin and were clearly satanic. The rituals took place at various locations, including Rushworth. Mick and other children would be driven to the rituals in the boots of cars. The members of the cult were extremely powerful members of society. There were numerous politicians (mainly from the Liberal Party). These people would often speak of"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 97 important events before they would actually occur. Mick was also sexually abused by Graham Kennedy, the famous television personality and professional partner of Bert Newton. Mick was one of the many children who were used to ‘host’ parties of the cult members. At these parties the children acted as waiters and were naked. Many of the adults, but not all, would wear masks at these parties. After the foo d was served the adults would have sex with the children. Children who tried to escape were killed, often in front of the other children in order to control the children through fear. Once Mick and another child had tried to escape but were caught. The oth er child was murdered by having her head smashed open with a rock. Her body was then dumped in a nearby mineshaft . Mick was spared the same fate, as he was told that he was the ‘chosen one, ’ selected to carry on the traditions of the group. Mick was forced to participate in the production of child pornography, including movies as well as still photographs. This involved sexual activity with other children as well as adults . He would get paid a small amount for his sexual ‘services, ’ while the relative who brought him to the events would get paid a large amount of money. As he got older, Mick was no longer used for sexual purposes by the group but was required to recruit new younger children. When he was old enough (in his 20's), Mick was able to escape the group , but they continue to contact him with threats. Robert Osmotherly's ‘Religion’ During my association with Robert Osmotherly I got to know him quite well. One day he informed me of his \"religious\" beliefs. These were the opposite of mine (as I am a Christian). I was also informed by one of his colleagues in the media industry that Bob's ‘religion’ is ‘weird shit.’ At the time I had not heard of the Illuminati and it is only now that I realise that Robert Osmotherly is an active and dedicated member of the Australian Illuminati. The symbolism used in Network 10 promotional material is totally consistent with that of the Illuminati, such as the key colours - blue and gold, and key imagery involving flames. Telephone Interference and Intimidation Begins It was after reporting the events at Rushworth to Robert Osmotherly that unusual events began to occur. My phone line began clicking, and the voice -mail service recorded the sounds of a tape clicking over (note that voicemail does not use tapes for recording so the tape was from another source). Two of my organisations' staff members had their cars broken into on the same night. In one car, the book ‘The Clocks’ by Agatha Christie was on the front seat. The book is the story of a series of murders where the only evidence left at each murder scene is a clock. On the front seat of the other staff member's car was a broken clock. Nothing was stolen from either car. On one occasion I purposely said over the phone that I kept all of my files in the backyard shed (this was not true, I just wanted to test the security of the telephone line). Soon after, the back shed was broken into. Board Members Propose a Name-Change At one board meeting, the head of the Agricultural Society, proposed to launch the organisation, despite the fact that it had been operating for nearly two years. He had three"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 98 ideas. The first was that a rodeo would be organised, and whenever a rider fell from their horse or bull, money would be donated. Thus, it would be ‘money for every bruised butt.’ The second proposal was to organise a ‘beauty pageant’ for 12 -year-old girls. There would be an award given for ‘the prettiest girl on the shiniest pony.’ A photo of her on her horse would be used as a centre -page -spread in the leading newspaper (courtesy of the Editor - In-Chief contact). The third proposal was to have a photo of sexually abused children in an ‘animal birthing centre.’ This photo would also be published in the leading newspaper. The Ag Society head also proposed a name -change. He proposed to change the name of the organisation to 'Shine .' I did not want to do this, and the members of the Board put me under incredible pressure to adopt this name -change. It was only later that I learnt about the Illuminati connections and the significance of their symbolism and language. 'Shine' is a very signific ant Illuminati term. Realisation Dawns It was at this point that I realised that something was dreadfully wrong. I rejected all of the proposed ideas (very politely, but firmly). I also called for all outstanding Criminal Records Checks to be undertaken immediately. The Criminal Records Check had been designed only to identify whether a person had committed any sexual assaults against children or had any involvement in related offences, such as child pornography. Therefore, if a person had smoked marijuana in their university days, this would not be revealed in the Criminal Record Check. This was a policy that I had insisted on right from the start (nearly two years ago), however Robert Osmotherly had given numerous excuses every time I had requested his. He even went so far as to suggest that he would organise it \"on the sly\" using his \"contacts in the force\". I did not pursue that option and instead gave the Board members two weeks to complete their forms and submit them. Robert Osmotherly, while initially embracing the policy at the start, ultimately refused to submit a Criminal Records Check. The Significance of Shine I discovered that there is an Australian Internet -based group called 'Shine'. The site includes a membership section where members are able to exchange photos etc, including ‘S&M’ and ‘hard-core Bert Newton style.’ It is a child pornography club that operates similar to the notorious Wonderland club. I noted the code -names used by the operators of the Shine site, one of which was Natas (Satan backwards). I went to the Network 10 site and entered a secret section on the site (which members of the public would never know about). It asked for the password, so I typed in Natas, which took me to another level. It then asked for the next level password, which I didn't have. The computer then went berserk and was almost impossible to turn off. I managed to do so only by pulling out all of the connections. Soon after this, the Internet site for Network 10 was shut down and remained shut down for a number of months, which is rather unusual given that Network 10 is such a large company. After that year, the Department of Education put on a concert involving thousands of children. They chose to call it 'Shine'. This was an interesting choice of title, given my experience and other people's experiences of the Department of Education protecting pedophile teachers."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 99 A further interesting connection was that Robert Osmotherly and RS organised a meeting between us and the senior managers of the D epartment of Education. When we all met, the men acted as if they did not know each other and were meeting for the first time (exchanging business cards, etc). However, when the men thought I was gone (I was in fact standing just out of their sight), it wa s very clear that they not only knew each other, but that they knew each other extremely well. They were saying things such as ‘Great to see you again, mate!’ and slapping each other on the back! Escape from Robert Osmotherly and the Pedophile Board After I discovered what was going on (at least, I started to discover what was going on) I knew I had to break away from Robert Osmotherly, RS and the people they had put on the Board of Management. The A GM was coming up and I organised for my family to attend. We did this secretly, as we knew that the phone lines were being monitored. On the night of the AGM, the board members were visibly shocked when they saw that members of my family were attending. It transpired that, rather than undertake a Criminal Records Check, the members of the Board had planned to resign on the spot. This served two purposes ; (1) they avoided having to undergo the Criminal Records Check ; (2) the organisation would effectively fold as there would be no -one to take up the Board member positions. This is exactly what Robert Osmotherly had wanted from the beginning, but especially since I had begun to uncover the corrupt pedophile police activities and the crimes in Rushworth. However, as my family had attende d the meeting, they were able to take up the positions on the Board, and the organisation did not fold. On the surface, the meeting was very amicable and civilized, Robert Osmotherly tried to remain calm, but he ended up storming out of the meeting half-an-hour early. Mother Receives Death Threat from Robert Osmotherly My family and I all waited for half-an-hour after the meeting had closed (to recover!) before leaving. We had all come in different cars, and my mother had parked her car in a nearby car park. She walked to her car by herself. We had not learnt to be secur ity-conscious at that stage. As she approached her car she was surprised to see Robert Osmotherly there (he had left the meeting half an hour early). He then approached her and said , ‘You had better watch yourself. If you don't, someone might just run over you.’ He then drove off very suddenly and another board member followed in a different car. My mother and father told me about this incident, which had left my mother very shaken. Soon after I received a message from Robert Osmotherly saying, ‘I only want to help.’ I was infuriated at this man, so I phoned his office and left a message with his Personal Assistant, Pam Cullen (I didn't know the significance of her husband's relationship with Robert Osmotherly and Network 10 at this time) saying, ‘Bob has said he just wants to help me. Could you please tell him that it would be helpful if he could undertake the Criminal Records Check that he has avoided for so long. After all, it is designed to only reveal if the person has committed sex offences against children or related offences, like the production of child pornography. Oh, could you also tell him it would be very helpful if he did not threaten"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 100 members of my family. Death threats against my family really aren't helpful. If you could pass this me ssage on, that would be great. Thanks.’ Soon after leaving this message, my mother received a letter from Robert Osmotherly. In the letter he stated that he was only joking when he told her to watch out or she'd end up being run over. Yeah, real funny joke. Report to Department of Education - Complaints and Investigation Unit After these experiences I made a complaint to the Complaints and Investigations Unit of the Department of Education. My complaint related to the conduct of Rushworth pedophile teacher, which amounted to repeated acts of misconduct against students, and the police investigation at Rushworth. Interestingly, the head of the Department of Education Complaints and Investigations Unit, PG, was at the very first meeting I had to outline my co mplaint. It was after this meeting that the material, which I had been assured by P G would remain strictly confidential, was given to Chris O’Connor and EI (who subsequently paid a visit to the new President of the Board in an effort to pressure me to drop the complaint). PG then left that posting, but ‘coincidentally’ was brought back to it to finish off the case involving the pedophile teacher . PG wrote a letter to me exonerating Rushworth teacher on all counts ‘because the witnesses (which I had provided) cannot substantiate your claims. ’ As you know, of the eight witnesses that I had provided to corroborate the case, only one had been contacted - and she re-confirmed the concerns about the pedophile teacher. In fact, she stated that she was amaze d that it had taken so long for the matter to be investigated! She was shocked to discover that Rushworth teacher had been exonerated and that the Department of Education had LIED about her testimony! After I did the telephone round of the witnesses I had listed and learnt that only one had been contacted, I phoned PG to ask how many of the witnesses had in fact been contacted. He said that he didn't know but that he would call me back ‘within 24 hours.’ Needless to say, I did not receive a return phone call from pedophile -protecting PG. I truly believe that if the parents of children attending Victorian schools knew the extent to which pedophile -teachers are being protected by the Department of Education, they would boycott the education system altogether. And if they knew the suffering that some children and families have had to endure as a result of the pedophile -protecting actions of the Department of Education, they would boycott the system on those grounds too. I am convinced if the parents of children attending the northern region secondary college knew of the abhorrent behaviour of the man teaching their children, and his shocking and extensive history of abusing students, there would not be a single child enrolled in that school in the future! Leaked Document After numerous meetings concerning the complaint (which I was told would be kept strictly confidential, particularly from Chris O’Connor and his unit), a document was leaked to me from within the Department of Education. This document revealed that the Department planned to absolve the Rushworth teacher from all complaints. The investigation had been totally and completely corrupted in order to absolve the pedophile teacher ."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 101 The grounds for this were that ‘no complaints of a sexual nature have been made against the Rushworth teacher since 1995.’ This was unbelievable! So, the pedophile teacher's invitations for students to meet his penis after school were not considered to be sexual! A lso, it was stated that as the schools had taken action in relation to each case, there was nothing more to be done. So, it was therefore acceptable for a teacher to commit repeated acts of serious misconduct, against multiple students, at different school s. It was very clear that this teacher was being actively protected. Theft of Department of Education Files I left a message with the Minister for Education to inform her that I had received information to indicate that the investigation had been seriously corrupted. Soon after, the unit that I lived in was broken into and files containing information about the Department of Education's protection of pedophile teachers were stolen. This included a letter from a mother pleading for help as her son had been sexually assaulted by a teacher and was now suicidal. She wanted my help as the Department of Education was covering up for this pedophile teacher. Nothing else was stolen from the unit. Visit to the New President of the Board A new President was appointed to the Board, along with other new members. One day, the new President of the Board received a visit from one of the workers in the child protection field. This woman, EI, approached the new President and told him that Detective Senior Sergeant Chris O’Connor knew about the complaint I had made to the Department of Education (indicating a significant breach of confidentiality). She told the new President to cease any association with me and my organisation ‘for the sake of your professional reputation.’ The incident spooked the new President enough for him to telephone me in an effort to get me to drop my complaint against Chris O’Connor and his unit, which I refused to do. Thankfully, the new President had the integrity and courage to stick with our organisation despite the pressure he was being put under. Anonymous reports to Crime Stoppers Approximately 12 months had passed when I decided I would make an anonymous call to Crime Stoppers, a phone -in service where people can give anonymous tips to police about crimes. I telephoned Crime Stoppers from a public phone and informed the woman, Katie, of the pedophile network that was operating in Melbourne. She asked me to call back again with further information and I did so. I told Katie that the network was operating under police protection and at that stage had not given her the police officers' names who were im plicated. She then asked me to provide the names of the police officers who were involved. I told her that I was very nervous to do this, as my family and I had suffered very negative repercussions as a result of this group and I didn't want us to have to go through any more traumas. She spoke to her boss and he promised me that the information I provided would not go to the police officers of concern, and that the information would go straight to the Ethical Standards Division (ESD), which is the same as I nternal Investigations. As she and her boss had promised that the information would go straight to ESD, I gave her the names of the officers."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 102 When I called back again to find out how the case was proceeding , I was shocked when Katie told me that her boss had forced her to send the information to Chris O’Connor 's unit! The information had gone directly to Chris O’Connor!! Katie apologised and appeared to be genuinely distressed at what had happened. I asked to speak to her boss and I told him that he had promised that the material would go to ESD, and he exclaimed: ‘Do you realise how serious your allegations are?’ I replied that of-course I did - that's why I wanted the information to go to ESD, and not to the police officers of concern! He said, ‘We don't pass on information to ESD.’ Katie then got back on the phone and was clearly very upset. She implored me to contact ESD and give them the information myself. Intimidation and Harassment Begins Again Soon after this, my family and I were subjected to harassment and surveillance. For example, nearly every day there would be a car out the front of my parent's home (where I had now moved to, for safety reasons), with two men just sitting there. The men often had large walkie -talkies. The cars often had large, thick aerials. Whenever a member of the family walked out of the house the people in the cars would speed off . However, sometimes we were followed by the people in the cars. The cars were usually very flashy, like large four -wheel -drives or dark shiny sedans. I was often followed by men in white shiny cars with the number plates beginning with VHA and was to late r learn that these cars were often used as government vehicles. Sometimes I would come out of a location, say a friend's house, and there would be a man in one of the flashy vehicles just waiting there. It was very menacing and very stressful for my family and I. We also received unusual phone -calls at that time, clicking noises over the phone and sometimes the phone -calls were actively intercepted with heavy breathing or laughter or shuddering screams. My incoming mail was very clearly being interfered wit h. Visits from the Mormons One day my mother and I came out from my parent's house and there was a group of men waiting in a car out the front of our house again. They sped off when we came out, but this time I got in my car and followed them. As I drove towards them (they had turned their car around and were facing me) they flashed their lights at me. I drove around the cul-de -sac and was shocked when I got to my parent's house again. The men were talking to my mother from in their car. I called for her to get away from the men and she replied, ‘Its OK dear, they're Mormons.’ I did not believe they were Mormons and I held my hand on the car horn and chased them out of the street. A licence check on their car however, seemed to indicate that they really wer e Mormons, or were using a Mormon- registered car. I did not think they would ever return (especially if they really were Mormons!). However, two weeks later I was getting into my car and saying goodbye to my mother. The same men approached my mother, not r ealising I was in the car. They asked if they could ask her a few questions about me. I then stuck my head out of the car window and said, ‘If you've got any questions you can ask me!’ They were very surprised that I was there and asked, ‘Why did you chase us out"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 103 of the street that day. We are just Mormons.’ I replied, ‘Because some of your behaviour is most un-Mormon-like! ’ The man the n said, ‘Like what?’ and I replied, ‘Like flashing your lights at me.’ He then said, ‘Oh, you mean when we were taking photos of you? You didn't like us taking photos of you?’ The 'Mormons' had just admitted to taking photos of me, without my knowledge or consent. I told them to stay away from me and my family. Soon after this I saw the same men in a different car. It was a dark, flashy sedan, similar to those that were often sitting in our street. I got the licence plate of this car and gave it to a trusted police office. He told me that the car was owned by a debt-collecting agency, or more likely, a surveill ance company as they often used debt-collecting as a front. The owner of the car, however not one of the men who had been seen in the car, was a Mormon. The Mormons were very clearly conducting surveillance on my family and me. Reports to Deputy Ombudsman After the problems with Crime Stoppers, I decided to call the Ombudsman's office and pass on the information I had to them, including the incident with Crime Stoppers. The Deputy Ombudsman put me under a great deal of pressure to meet with him and hand ov er all of my information to him for investigation. I said that I wanted to meet with the new Chief Commissioner of Police , Christine Nixon, as she was dedicated to flushing out bent police. Deputy Ombudsman told me that he would try to arrange this. Howeve r, he reported that it was not possible and again put me under great pressure to give all of my information to him for investigation. I finally did succeed in getting an appointment with the Chief Commissioner. Contrary to the Deputy Ombudsman's claim that she could not meet with me, she had never been informed that I had tried to get a meeting with her through him. She was extremely annoyed when she had been left out of the loop in this way, and the incident just added to my suspicions about the motives of the Deputy Ombudsman. Thefts of Evidence While I was reporting information to the Deputy Ombudsman over the phone anonymously, two thefts of evidence occurred. On the first occasion, the file was stolen from the boot of the car. I had left it there for two hours while I attended to a matter at a school. When I returned, I discovered that it had been taken. I rushed home to check that the copy left at my parent's house was still there. I discovered that my parent's house had been broken into, the dogs drugged, and the file stolen from a hiding place. Much was taken, including the letter of admission from Robert Osmotherly (of the threat to my mother). Luckily, I had kept a third copy with somebody else. Fires at Network 10 Studio, Melbourne GPO and Celebrity’s Home At this time a number of significant fires occurred. One was at a studio used by Network 10. Interestingly, the copy of the network's recent multi-million-dollar production had ‘coincidentally' been removed from the studio two days before the fire. All that survived the fire was a Sesame Street character, which took centre place in a photo of the scene in the leading newspaper's report."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 104 Within a week there was another fire, this time at the Melbourne General Post Office. All of the post offices boxes (and their contents) were destroyed, though little else was affected. Finally, again within a week, a suspicious house fire occurred in the home of a well - known television celebrity. This celebrity is a member of the same secret society as RS. All that was destroyed in the fire was a collection of videos and photographs. Interestingly, the comment of the celebrity was, ‘It can all be put to bed now.’ A strange thing to say after your house has just gone up in smoke . A further interesting incident occ urred at Melbourne's largest brothel. An armed intruder stole a relatively small amount of cash from the brothel but was led to the safe where videotapes of clients engaging in sexual activities were kept. Video tapes of clients were ‘stolen, ’ including those of Jeff Kennett, a frequent client of this establishment. A reliable contact informed me that the theft was actually an ‘inside job. ’ Within a two-week period, thousands of videos had gone up in smoke or destroyed. These events occurred at the time of the reports being made to Ian Snow. It is also very interesting to note that at that time, the British section of Interpol was in Victoria conducting a ‘secret’ investigation into child pornography. Children Tortured or Die in Mysterious Circumstances It was also around this time that a number of children connected to the child pornography industry were either killed in suspicious circumstances, or tortured. I was working with a young girl and was very concerned for her safety at this time . I told a trusted police officer of my concerns for this girl. A week later she had been rushed to hospital. An unregistered ‘tank ’ (her word, meaning a very solidly built car) had come out of nowhere and slammed into the car in which she was a passenger. Thankfully, she survived. Fears for My Life I had managed to arrange a meeting with the Chief Commissioner of Police (this was no small feat, as there had been many stumbling blocks, and it appeared that there were people actively trying to prevent such a meeting). In the weeks leading up to the meeting I was in real fear for my life. On one occasion I came home late at night and saw two men sitting in a car just up from my parent's house. As no-one was home at my parent's house, I drove to the top of the hill to stay with my friends. They did not hear the doorbell, and while I was standing in the street wondering where I would go, the men in the car drove up the hill very slowly, looking for me. I had all of the evidence with me (since the thefts I did not let it out of my sight) and had to quickly hide in the bushes. The men drove up and down the street no less than five times looking for me. I had to cut through the backs of homes in order to get to another friend's house, where I stayed the night. They also witnessed the men driving up and down the street looking for me. The next evening, I heard and saw the same car drive up the hill. As no-one was going to be home that evening, I quickly got in my car and drove to another friend's house where I stayed the night. The next morning the friends discovered that their front light had been smashed in. No other houses in the street had been affected. However, the neighbours did"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 105 report hearing strange cars driving up and down the quiet street late that night. It was after this that I wondered if I would live to be able to hand over all the information I had to the Chief Commissioner. Meeting with Christine Nixon, Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police I attended the meeting with Christine Nixon, Chief Commissioner of Victorian Police , along with the trusted police officer who had investigated the house break in and thefts of the files. The Chief Commissioner believed me and was very concerned. She organised for the matter to be thoroughly investigated. The Chief Commissioner asked me if I wanted police protection for my family, which I declined (sometimes that results in more trouble). She told me I could contact her office whenever necessary. Soon after this my unit was broken into and one of my c ollectable dolls had the eyes painted over. I phoned the Chief Commissioner's Personal Assistant and let her know that I would be sending the Chief a letter via registered mail. At the start of the conversation the line was clearly intercepted, which the P ersonal Assistant heard. She told me to call her back from a public phone. Interestingly, after letting her know that a letter was coming to her via registered mail, the Chief Commissioner did not receive it. I called some weeks later after having received no response and was told that the letter had somehow been intercepted! All letters to the Chief are signed for, and the person who had signed for the registered letter I had sent was not known in the police force. However, after two days of the Chief Commissioner demanding to know where the letter went, it turned up with a post-it note attached, 'Sorry, didn't know where to send this.' Well, to the person it is addressed to might be a start! Ethical Standards Department (ESD) Investigation Gets off to a Questionable Start I had a meeting to begin my statement to the Ethical Standards Department. It was clear that the officer appointed to the case did not believe what I had to report. While he went to have a smoke, he (accidentally) left me with the report that had been written by another police officer in response to my own report (that had been submitted to the Chief). I could see why the police officer I was dealing with was so dismissive of what I had to say. The report discredited everything that I had reported. It made a mockery of my claim that Bert Newton and other high-profile individuals were involved in pedophilia and stated that there was nothing to support my claims of intimidation and harassment. This was despite the fact that there were numer ous witnesses to these events. The author went on to say that an investigation must be seen to be conducted, however, because if the information was to be made public there would be a public outcry. That is, make it look like it is being investigated, but don't do anything! Even more disturbing was the specific recommendation that a Detective be appointed to conduct the investigation. The d etective was a close friend and colleague of Chris O’Connor's and had in fact worked with him in his unit for many year s. Indeed, he had only left Chris O’Connor 's unit three months ago to be transferred to ESD. It was very interesting timing. At the same time Chris O’Connor receives information that someone is dobbing him in"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 106 for misconduct, his close friend and colleague gets a transfer to ESD and ends up with the job of investigating his best mate! How very convenient. The Deputy Ombudsman Gets the Investigation After this turn of events (I reported it all to the Chief Commissioner), the Deputy Ombudsman was given the investigation. Child Care Centre, Pedophile Network, Police Pedophiles and Network 10 The Deputy Ombudsman informed me briefly about a case in the early 1990's. I did my own research into this case and discovered that it involved a creche in the Mornington Peninsula region. A high -profile group of men were sexually abusing, torturing and hypnotising the children. The owner and his wife took the children out of the centre during the day to the homes of the rich and powerful, where the children would be sexually abused, tortured and filmed. The children were also subjected to satanic ritual abuse. This case was almost identical to those in the US A (Little Rascals, McMartin and others). The offenders were wealthy and powerful men in the community and included police officers. Video copies of the children being abused were obtained by Network 10 (how interesting it is that Network 10 should be involved). However, when the story went public, the video tapes went ‘ missing’ and the police claimed that they never received them. Ultimately, the police did not take any action against the owner of the creche, on the grounds that the children were too young to be viewed as credible witnesses. While there was conclusive evidence that four of the children had been raped or sexually abused while at the day care centre, the owner was never charged. A concerned parent with links to the underworld offered the head of a bikie group $10,000 to inflict enough damage so as to ensure that the owner of the cr eche could never sexually abuse another child again. The head of the bikie group said that they knew about the owner of the creche, and what he was up to, however, they could not do the job. Much as they would like to, the owner had protection from the ver y highest levels. He was untouchable. When the Mornington Peninsula child-care -centre case broke, an investigative journalist infiltrated an elite child -pornography and pedophile club based in Melbourne. Its members were all wealthy and elite members of Me lbourne society. It was chaired by the CEO of a major Melbourne Charitable Trust. This article included information on their use of telephone monitoring, courtesy of the group's contacts within Telecom. The children from the Mornington Peninsula child-care -centre reported being taken to a ‘pink’ room with a spa and other significant decor. It was in a house where the children were sexually abused, tortured and filmed (amongst other locations). Three children independently identified to the investigators the house that they had been taken to. Sure enough, the room had been painted a dusty-pink color, and it had a spa and the other decor items described by the children. However, as you now know, no further action was taken against the owner of the child-care -centre, nor others suspected of being involved in the ring. What is most significant however, is that the pink house WAS REGISTERED TO THE VICTORIA POLICE!!"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 107 I am now working with some of the young survivors of the child-care centre and their families. It is clear that a cover-up of the highest order occurred in 1992, and the children and their families are still suffering from it. Present Days All of this material is currently being investigated by the Deputy Ombudsman. However, the investigation has been marred by suspicious activity. Perhaps the most significant example is the conduct of the police officer Ian Soft appointed to head the investigation: Detective Jock Westland. My colleague, a counsellor who worked on the 1992 Mornington Peninsula Creche case, provided Jock Westland with information pertaining to a video tape that depicted police actively involved in the satanic-ritual-sexual abuse of children from the creche. This is highly significant information. However, I discover ed from one of the other investigators that Jock Westland had decided not to pass this information on for further investigation. In fact, his notes read, ‘ This witness (my colleague) has no information of significance. ’ In addition to this, Jock Westland r efused to investigate my claims of intimidation and harassment on the grounds that I was ‘paranoid.’ This is despite the fact that there are many witnesses to certain events who can corroborate my claims, and indeed, several have provided Statutory Declarations to do so. Jock Westland has been under ‘investigation’ for these actions for two months now, and I am yet to find out whether he will continue to be involved in this investigation. If he remains on the case , we can be sure that this so-called investigation is just another example of high-level white-wash and cover-up of organised pedophilia and child pornography in Australia. A final note on the Department of Education investigation. I received a letter stating that the Rushworth teacher had been cle ared of all charges, as the witnesses could not substantiate my claims. However, of the pool of eight witnesses I had provided ONLY ONE HAD BEEN CONTACTED and she clearly re -affirmed the concerns about the Rushworth teacher. Another cover-up of the highest order and complete protection given to one of the untouchable pedophile elite. * * * Ombudsman Bashed plus Other Anomalies - Norman and Alison Shulver ran the Mornington Child Care Centre and Nursery School, in Parwan Crescent, Mornington, a bayside suburb of Victoria. - The Police Child Exploitation Unit investigated and determined that 24 children alleged abuse while attending the Centre.

In 2005, the Melbourne OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis) used an interstate ACT judge to sue the website owners for publishing Reina Michaelson’s aforementioned experiences on their site . On 28 June 2005, the A CT Magistrate's Court ordered Devine and Legg to remove the article and pay the OTO $30,000. The OTO subsequently repeated this tactic of using ACT judges to silence anyone from any state who posted anything negative about them on the internet, until a defendant won their case . In 2006, Victoria’s Labor government amended the Religious and Racial Tolerance Act of 2001 specifically to target Dr Reina Michaelson. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal tested the amendment by hearing a case the OTO brought against Reina Michaelson. The VCAT (Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal) wrongly determined the OTO met the Act’s definition of a religion. Thelema , which the OTO practised, technically met the definition, but the OTO did not. Reina Michaelson’s lawyer ignored this fact and ruined her case . Consequently , the VCAT decided Dr Michaelson’s account of the Victorian pedophile network religiously vilified OTO members and ordered her to remove the document from the internet. Reina had been set up for this court case because she did not have control over the websites that published the document and never gave her permission for the docum ent to be posted."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 109 On 28 November 2007 , VCAT Judge Harbison sentenced Devine and Legg to 9 months prison for contempt of court for not removing the document from their gaiaguys website .

The following articles that I wrote for Independent Australia online news journal capture my experience s: NSW Education Department Covers up Teacher’s Alleged 18-Y ear Child Sex Abuse Spree Fiona Barnett, Independent Australia , 25 June 2013. The Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse, which has commenced private hearings in Brisbane this month, is expected to shed light on one of Tweed Shire's darkest secrets — horrifying abuse, systematic cover -ups and institutional failure and corruption in NSW schools and the police service. Parent and whistle -blower Fiona Barnett fronts the Commission tomorrow — here she tells part of this story ON 14 MARCH 2006, Jill Carlon, Chief Investigator for Employee Performance & Conduct of the Department of Education and Training, sent concerned Tweed Shire parents a letter: I am writing to advise you of the finalisation of the investigation and follow up action taken in respect to allegations that a teacher at Centaur Primary School, acted in a manner that could amount to improper conduct against students... In reviewing the investigation, all the available information has been carefully considered and, as a result, steps have been taken to ensure that the person will no longer be employed or involved in school, TAFE or student-related activities. The letter brought to an end, at least for the parents involved, an 18 -year nightmare and an alleged reign of terror by that teacher — of physical, emotional and sexual assault and abuse. However, many questions still remain, including how this man was allowed to be exposed to vulnerable children over such a long period? How has this matter been covered up for so long? How was he able to continue teaching in NSW independent schools, and in public schools just a few miles away across the border in Queensland? Why have NSW police consistently refused to properly investigate his activities? And why has he never faced criminal prosecution? The teacher in question was Gary Willis, a middle -aged man who transferred to Northern NSW in the late 1980s. Despite allegedly having no prior experience in special needs, Willis received a 3-year position at East Murwillumbah Primary School’s Special Education Unit. Almost immediately Willis began working at the School, allegations of inappropriate behaviour emerged — even directly in front of parents. For instance, one outraged mother related, in a written statement, that Gary Willis had allegedly exposed his penis and urinated directly in front of children, parents, and teachers during a school excursion: "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 111 Gary Willis made no attempt to be discrete [sic] or hide his penis from any of us and grinned the whole time he was urinating. I was horrified that a teacher would conduct himself in this manner in front of young children, so I repo rted the incident to the principal, Al Gudgeon . Principal Gudgeon asked the parent to tell him specific times and dates of the incidents, apparently so that he could report them. The mother provided the requested information, but said the principal never followed through with the complaint: I became very frustrated and angry with Al Gudgeon because I believed he was not taking any of these matters seriously and trying to cover up all complaints. I felt so strongly about the lack of protection and moral ob ligation to all children attending East Murwillumbah Primary School because of Al Gudgeon and Gary Willis, I transferred my children to another school. In the classroom, Gary Willis was responsible for the most vulnerable children imaginable — children wh o were intellectually disabled, autistic, unable to walk and unable to speak. Former students, parents, and teachers allege that Gary Willis sexually and physically assaulted these disabled children. Witnesses, including other teachers, also say they witne ssed Gary Willis being violent toward students, including allegedly ramming a wheelchair bound child into a wall and thrusting another disabled boy’s head into a sink. Two teachers stated that Gary Willis constantly refused to allow female aids to toilet t he female students and that he insisted on doing this delicate task himself. Arguably even more shocking, witnesses allege that Gary Willis taught mainstream schoolboys to sexually assault the disabled girls. Medical evidence, police interviews and local DOCS intervention appear to support this claim. Police, DOCS, and a paediatrician concluded that two girls had been sexually assaulted at East Murwillumbah Primary School; Gary Willis was named in both cases. Parents subsequently watched him being seized by police from the school for questioning. How was he allowed to allegedly perform these heinous acts almost entirely unchecked? To begin with, it seems his line manager, East Murwillumbah’s Special Needs Unit head Steve Tyler (now deceased), at best turned a blind eye to his alleged activities and, at worst, according to some reports, may have even been an active participant in the abuse. Numerous witnesses complained to East Murwillumbah Principal Al Gudgeon about these and other abuse allegations. But Al Gudgeon apparently delayed notifying the Education Department and DOCS of the allegations and instead tried to cover the matter up — including by making late night phone calls to parents, where he allegedly threatened them with legal and departmental action if they continued their complaints, amongst other repercussions. To keep the staff quiet, Gudgeon allegedly threatened teachers with dismissal if they spoke to parents about what they had witnessed at the school. What is more, teachers also complained about Al Gudgeon’s own inappropriate behaviour. One described an incident when the principal allegedly used a child to deliver a picture of a penis to a 22 -year-old female teachers’ aide, and then complained when his gift was returned. Parents and staff complained about the child abuse allegations at East Murwillumbah School ‒ verbally, personally, and in writing ‒ to the Education Department’s Head Office in"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 112 Sydney, to the Lismore Regional Office and to the Cluster Director at the Murwillumbah District Office . A special needs teacher aide, Debra Edwards, submitted a hand-written complaint (dated 25 July 1991) to Cluster Director John Quill. Mrs Edwards reported catching Gary Willis with a naked, disabled, female student (\"AA\") on an excursion. In her complaint, Mrs Edwards alleged that she witnessed Gary Willis take the child AA to the men’s toilet during another excursion and doing something to her that made her laugh uncharacteristically while toileting. On another excursion, she said she witnessed Gary Willis take AA for a lone motorbike ride into the bush and then admit to having toileted her. Mrs Edwards also says she witnessed Willis physically assault children. Debra Edwards never heard from the Education Department regarding her written complaint to the Cluster Director. To her knowledge, neither Principal Al Gudgeon nor the Department ever informed the girl's parents that formal complaints had been made concerning the alleged abuse of their daughter whilst in the care of the East Murwillumbah Primary School. The Department did, however, subsequently ban Gary Willis from approaching the child. When parents further complained to Cluster Director John Quill that Gary Willis was allegedly sexually abusing their children, Quill concluded that the best outcome parents could hope for was to have the perpetrator transferred to another school. In response to multiple child abuse complaints, witnesses say the NSW Education Department sent three investigators to East Murwillumbah Primary School to monitor the behaviour of Gary Willis for three weeks. Unfortunately, Gary Willis was allegedy warned that these investigators were coming and so behaved impeccably during the observation period. After concluding their watching brief, the investigators reported that they per ceived no problem with Gary Willis. They reached these conclusions despite not having interviewed any parents or staff witnesses. Parent ‘DM’ stated that she received a phone call from a Sydney solicitor acting on behalf of Gary Willis. The solicitor state d that she was representing Willis in some matter involving ‘AA.’ The solicitor sent a document for DM to sign, which asked her to attest that Gary Willis never hurt her intellectually disabled daughter. But Gary Willis did, allegedly, hurt her daughter — as the former student’s statement reveals: Mr Tyler was watching when Mr Willis put the stick between my legs... Mr Willis put stick in other girls – L... Mr Willis pulls pants down all the time, and Mr Tyler, before he died, he watched him. Mr Willis showed everyone what he’s got. He played with it... Teacher Jeff Fallon stated that around 1994 (the same time DM received the phone call from a Sydney solicitor), he received a visit from a frantic Al Gudgeon, who stated that a complaint concerning DM's daughter had ‘gone up a notch’ and was now with the Minister for Education. The principal allegedly asked Fallon whether he possessed a copy of the minutes from meetings he and Gudgeon attended concerning the abuse allegations at the school. Jeff Fallon said the Education Department suspended Gary Willis from teaching in the early 1990s, and placed him at Murwillumbah District Office for 12 months while he was being investigated for misconduct."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 113 South Tweed Primary School In 1991, the NSW Education Department transferred Gary Willis to South Tweed Primary School, where he was assigned to teach infants. Parents and teachers soon complained to the principal about how Gary Willis presented himself and acted around students. For example, one teacher described in a statement his work attire: He wore short ‘ruggers’ with no underpants, and often you could see the cheeks of his bum, his testicles, and his penis hanging out the bottom. He wore thongs and old, faded stretched round-neck t-shirts. I can’t remember ever seeing him dressed differently. Parents at the new school soon began complaining about Gary Willis’ mistreatment of their children. For instance, a Grade One boy (‘ E’ ), told his mother that Gary Willis constantly locked himself with little girls in the class storeroom. Other former students recalled similar incidents: I remember Mr Willis took one or two girls into the classroom storeroom alone and shut the door. He would stay in there for a while. The girls would go into the storeroom with neat hair, but would come out with messed up hair. Sometimes the girls would look upset and as though they were about to cry. Mr Willis chose the pretty girls to take into the storeroom. ‘E’ also complained that he was being constantly harassed and physically assaulted by Gary Willis. E’s mother appealed for help to a friend of hers, Dawn Mitchell. Mrs Mitchell happened to know about Gary Willis from East Murwillumbah Primary School, where she had accompanied DM to meetings with Al Gudgeon. Mrs Mitchell also happened to know the family of an Indigenous boy in Gary Willis’s class (‘ T’ ). In a signed statement, T recalled being physically and emotionally abused by Gary Willis, who – he alleged – regularly called him ‘coon,’ ‘nigger and ‘the black snake.’ Two former classmates and one former teacher corroborated T's testimony in writing. Mrs Mitchell consulted South Tweed Primary School’s Aboriginal Liaison Officer / School Counsellor, Joan Sheriff, and relayed the child abuse allegations against Gary Willis that had arisen at Murwillumbah East Primary School. Ms Sheriff apparently reprimanded Mrs Mitchell for making the accusations, but then allegedly said: ‘I never did like his short shorts.’ The Principal then contacted Mrs Mitchell and arranged a meeting with her, during which Mrs Mitchell reported Gary Willis’ extensive history of child abuse allegations. But just days following the two meetings, Gary Willis supervised a school sleepover attended by infant children. During the sleepover, Gary Willis allegedly sexually assaulted six young girls. The following day, parents, teachers, and students witnessed the girls in a distressed state at school assembly. Three Tweed South parents complained to the school principal, counsellor and teachers regarding Gary Willis’ abuse of children. According to them, their complaints were mishandled and denied. One of the parent's daughter's wrote a statement when she was 20:"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 114 I recall that Gary Willis came to my house out of the blue one night and insisted on getting some takeaway and having dinner with my mother and I. My mother looked shocked at this, and she couldn’t get rid of him. In an effort to get him away from our house, my mother suggested we go somewhere else for dinner. We went to Club Banora and had the buffet. All nigh t during this meal, Mr Willis sat me on his lap, played with my hair, and told me how beautiful I was. Despite parents’ ongoing protest, Gary Willis was allowed to supervise a second school camp at Hastings Point. Again, teachers, parents and students allegedly witnessed Gary Willis visit young girls’ tents late into the night. Parents and teachers complained that Gary Willis allegedly made young female school children change into their sports uniforms in the back of his panel van while he watched. Witnesses also recall Gary Willis taught girls dancing at Tweed Heads South Public School and an occasion in which he supervised these dancers at a combined schools’ concert at a local club. During the concert, Gary Willis was allegedly seen refusing to allow par ents to change his young dancers backstage, so that he alone changed them. A Tweed Heads South Public School teacher witnessed complaints about Gary Willis allegedly flood into the school, particularly from Grade 5 and 6 students. When she consulted the principal about these complaints, she was told that ‘photographic evidence ’ was needed before the allegations could be acted on. The teacher stated that Gary Willis was subsequently banned from associating with the older students at the school, but was still placed in charge of infants. In 1992-93, the parents of an 8-year-old child girl in Gary Willis’ class phoned their friend, South Tweed teacher ‘Ms X’ and reported that Willis had just sexually assaulted their daughter ‘BB.’ Ms X immediately attended the family home and spoke with the victim. Gary Willis had allegedly asked BB and another little girl to stay behind after school that afternoon. He then allegedly took the girls into his classroom storeroom, fondled them, and digitally penetrated them. Consequently, BB suffered bed-wetting and screaming in her sleep. Despite Ms X’s pleading, the parents declined to have Gary Willis charged because they did not want to put their daughter through the police and legal system. Ms X reported the assault to the Principal Genevieve (Geni) Coughlin. The principal allegedly told Ms X to remain silent about the assaults. She also allegedly bullied her, yelled abuse at Ms X through her classroom window. She also subsequently allegedly criticised Ms X’s teaching to parents, though many of the same parents responded by supporting Ms X — at least one calling her ‘the best teacher ever.’ Ms X was pregnant during the worst of this abuse and says she began to experience stress and high blood pressure after these highly stressful experiences. Ms X complained to the District Inspector at Murwillumbah about Gary Willis and the principal’s bullying. The Director allegedly advised Ms X to: ‘Tell the people at South Tweed to have enough intestinal fortitude to stand up to her and come to me with their grievances, so I can do something about it.’ Ms X’s work colleagues shied from following the Inspector’s second -hand advice, allegedly out of fear of reprisal. The NSW Department of Education sent a counsellor to speak with South Tweed teaching staff. Without interviewing either the victim or her parents, the counsellor dismissed"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 115 Ms X’s allegations of child sexual abuse against Gary Willis as being unfounded. The counsellor allegedly told Ms X that she was being irrational, to think of her unborn baby, and she advised the whistle -blower to ‘punch a pillow’ to relieve her frustration and anger regarding Gary Willis and the principal. Ms X subsequently suffered a ne rvous breakdown and resigned from the NSW Department of Education altogether. She could not cope with entering a school again for 20 years. The once -passionate teacher concluded: I was the one who the Department said needed counselling, and I was the one who ultimately resigned in frustration, and yet a suspected child sex abuser was left alone in his classroom, teaching. Following multiple complaints against Gary Willis at South Tweed Primary School, the NSW Education Department eventually transferre d him to the neighbouring Centaur Primary School. Centaur Primary School In 1998, when Ms X’s youngest child started school at Centaur Primary School she was appalled to see Gary Willis at the school, still teaching. She immediately consulted the princip al Mary-Anne Judge. Ms X told Ms Judge about Gary Willis’ history of abusing children, and warned that he was not to approach her child. The principal allegedly responded: ‘I absolutely understand. I wouldn’t have him here if I had any other option. I’m stuck with him.’ Dawn Mitchell’s own daughter attended Centaur Primary School. In 1998, upon discovering that her child had been placed in Gary Willis’ English class, Mrs Mitchell (accompanied by parents Eric and Jeanette Ackerman) met with principal Mary -An ne Judge. Mrs Mitchell raised concerns about Gary Willis teaching her children and his history of alleged abuse at his two previous schools. Principal Judge allegedly told the three parents that she was unaware of any abuse allegations and she challenged Mrs Mitchell to either prove them or stay silent. That evening, Principal Judge phoned Mrs Mitchell and allegedly stated that what the mother had said regarding Gary Willis’s abuse allegations was true, but that she would not confirm it in front of other parents. Mary-Anne Judge said that she had been trying unsuccessfully to get rid of Gary Willis for quite a while but that the Education Department had resisted her efforts. Mary -Anne Judge indicated that, with this mother’s help, she might successfully ‘get rid of ’ Gary Willis. During their next encounter, Principal Judge allegedly told Mrs Mitchell that she had contacted the Education Department’s Regional Director, and that she was waiting to hear back from him. Mrs Mitchell next saw Principal Judge at a Grade 6 break-up dinner. Principal Judge is said to have asked this mother: ‘Have you noticed someone’s been conspicuous by their absence?’ She was apparently referring to Gary Willis, who had been absent from the school for some time. Mrs Mitchell said Principal Judge then stated: ‘Expect a visit by the NSW Education Department over the holidays.’ The mother was never contacted by the NSW Education Department. Feeling threatened, Mrs Mitchell pulled her daughter out of Centaur Primary School."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 116 Following a stint in administration at the Murwillumbah District Office, Gary Willis was reinstated at Centaur Primary School. Upon his return, multiple allegations of inappropriate behaviour and sexual abuse were subsequently reported to Principal Mary -Anne Judge. A former Centaur teacher, Sandy McGrady, alleged that every single Centaur teacher was aware of Gary Willis’ history of paedophilia allegations. She added that a Centaur parent confided in her that Willis sexually abused her daughter. Another teacher, Alison Howells, alleged that a cleaner caught Gary Willis sexually assaulting a girl in a Centaur Primary School storeroom. Another parent stated that Gary Willis sexually assaulted a Grade 5 student (‘ CC’ ) in 2003. In 2004, Centaur parent Sharon O’Grady allegedly confronted Principal Mary -Anne Judge about Gary Willis and she asked whether her daughter was at risk in the teacher’s care. Sharon O'Grady says Principal Judge replied ‘no’ and she denied any knowledge of Gary Willis’ history. At a Centaur Primary School disco to celebrate Harmony Day in 2004, parents Steven and Victoria Boyce reportedly saw Gary Willis dancing with young girls in an inappropriate fashion. They said he was dressed in a toga and ‘dirty danci ng’ with the girls, including pelvic thrusting towards them from behind. When Mrs Boyce complained to a teacher supervising the disco, the teacher apparently responded: ‘It’s all part of the fun.’ Teachers were seen taking photos of Gary Willis dancing at the disco. During the disco, Gary Willis allegedly entered the girls’ toilet and peered underneath a locked door at Mrs Boyce’s daughter. Mrs Boyce said she witnessed the deputy principal chastise Gary Willis for being in the girls’ toilet. Mrs Boyce alleged that Gary Willis made the girls in his class sit immodestly on the classroom floor. Instead of sitting with their legs crossed, he made them sit with their legs apart and knees bent up. Mrs Boyce said that she complained to the school about Gary Willis’ behaviour at the disco. When she mentioned other abuse allegations regarding Gary Willis, the deputy principal, Mr Burgess, allegedly stated: ‘ I’ve heard that before, but it’s a load of bullshit.’ In 2006, the NSW Department of Education finally determine d that the rumours were not bullshit — and they banned Gary Willis from teaching in the NSW public education system. However, because he had never been charged with a crime, Gary Willis was free to seek child- related employment in the NSW private education sector and interstate. After leaving the NSW Education Department, Gary Willis found two years of employment as a bus driver at a private Tweed Shire school, Lakeside Christian College (renamed Pacific Coast Christian School). Gary Willis was last seen living and working in Queensland. * * * NSW PROTECTS ALLEGED TWEED HEADS PEDOPHILE RING Fiona Barnett, Independent Australia , 26 June 2013. In 2004, concerned parent and whistle -blower Fiona Barnett became determined to end teacher Gary Willis’ (then) 15-year alleged child abuse spree — but the NSW Education Department and police had decidedly different ideas. Here, Fiona tells the second part of this story"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 117 In 2004, when I was six months pregnant, my lawn mowing lady raised the alarm. She began complaining about a male teacher at her children’s primary school who was reportedly abusing students. When the woman described the man’s extremely tight and brief shorts, I instantly recognised him as Gary Willis. I first heard about Gary Willis when I was attending a local high school in the late 1980s. I grew up hearing horrifying stories of this teacher allegedly abusing young disabled children at three local primary schools. Indeed, Gary Willis allegedly sexually, physically and psychologically abused children from the homes of four different family friends. I reasoned that the previous campaign against Gary Willis failed because parents complained from the bottom up. This approach allowed the perpetrators and their allies to intercept and quash any action. So, I lodged a complaint against Gary Willis, who was then teaching at Centaur Primary School. I alleged that Gary Willis had exhibited inappropriate behaviour toward students at three schools, raising concerns about the protection of Centaur child ren. I also named other teachers whom parents and staff had also alleged were pedophile s. I requested an investigation into the NSW Education Department’s mishandling of abuse allegations concerning Gary Willis over a 14-year period. I was aware that each time abuse allegations began pouring in at a school Gary Willis worked at, the Education Department simply transferred the man to another local school. The complaint letters were signed by a large group of concerned parents, and they were accompanied by copies of numerous witness statements. A former teacher aide and I collected signed letters from witnesses, including letters of complaint written up to 14 years prior. Former child victims, now in their 20s, themselves wrote some of these letters. Other victims, including disabled and illiterate witnesses, dictated and signed letters. Approximately 30 concerned parents signed various letters of complaint that were posted to Prime Minister John Howard, Bob Carr (NSW premier), Brendan Nelson (Federal education minister), Jenny Macklin (Federal Opposition education spokesperson), Andrew Refshauge (NSW minister for education), Jillian Skinner (NSW Opposition education spokesperson), and the NSW Ombudsman. I approached Tweed Heads Police detectives Josh Burton and Murray Baker, who told me that Gary Willis was known by the justice system with regards to child abuse allegations, and that DOCS involvement was mentioned onscreen. Detective Baker said that he put an Intel report into crime manager regarding the information I had gathered and he expressed concern over possible corruption within the Education Department. He stated that Willis had never been charged with anything. He told me that one complaint had been in the system from about 8 to 9 years ago, that it had not been substantiated. He told me that certain complaints I knew had been made to police did not appear on the screen under Gary Willis’ name. An EPAC Child Protection Investigator, Sandra Cameron, informed me that the NSW Education Department held a considerable number of files containing abuse allegations against teacher Gary Willis, including numerous written complaints by teachers. Ms Cameron said that much of the information was horrendous and allegedly of a criminal nature and that it had subsequently been turned over to the police."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 118 Our complaint was assigned to Chief Inspector Bob Sullivan of the NSW Child Protection and Sex Crimes Squad. On 27 October 2004, Bob Sullivan phoned witness DM (refer to Part 1), whose daughter (‘ Y’ ) had recently alleged that teachers Gary Willis and Steve Tyler (now deceased) had sexually assaulted her while she was a student at the East Murwillumbah Primary School. Y told her mother (DM) that she would like to pursue charging Gary Willis for his alleged crime. As a result of Bob Sullivan’s phone call, DM complained to the NSW Ombudsman. DM complained that Bob Sullivan had said our efforts were a waste of time and we wouldn’t get anywhere. He allegedly also said DM should think hard about pursuing a complaint against Gary Willis because it would go nowhere, since Y was disabled. Bob Sullivan also allegedly insisted that Y be interviewed at the Tweed Heads police station instead of at her local Brisbane sex crimes unit. Bob Sullivan did not, according to DM, ask for further information or clarification of existing information. DM also complained that Bob Sullivan left her with an overall feeling that there was no point to pursuing Y’s complaint against Gary Willis and that the policeman had been trying to talk her out of pursuing the matter. On 3 November 2004, I received a phone call from Inspector Bob Sullivan. During this call, Inspector Sullivan made what I allege are some startling and disturbing statements: - He criticised victims, parents and witnesses for expecting me to help them. - He described alleged serial pedophile Gary Willis as a ‘poor bloke’ and the victim of a ‘witch hunt.’ - He said there was no such thing as justice, and that achieving justice in this matter was not the aim of the police; - He accused me of fabricating witness letters, including a hand-written complaint personally submitted to the Education Department by a teacher aide some 14 years previous. - He said that NSW police have no record of any complaints against Gary Willis made by victims. When I challenged this by saying that two Tweed Heads detectives had told me the opposite, Inspector Sullivan contradicted himself by saying that police had investigated a number of complaints against Gary Willis, but that none of these had been substantiated. Then, he contradicted himself again, saying: ‘action was taken in 1993. ’ - He said there was no evidence of child abuse — just ‘innuendo and rumour.’ - He said he was not prepared to launch a proactive investigation into Gary Willis, as the victims probably would prefer to forget the past and get on with their lives. When I suggested he was pre -empting their reaction and added that many witnesses had been threatened and bribed into silence, and maybe they would feel safe and relieved talking to the police in such a way, Bob Sullivan asked: ‘Mrs Barnett, have you ever been the victim of a sexual assault? ’ - He said police were certainly not interested in the ‘minor assaults’ listed. - He said that if Y's case went to court, witnesses certainly could not be subpo enaed to testify and that only a Royal Commission had the power to interview reluctant witnesses."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 119 - He stated that Y had the best chance of charging Gary Willis, but that if her letter was the extent of her language ability, she would get nowhere and therefore there’s no point in her pursuing the matter. - He concentrated on just one of the alleged pedophile s, Gary Willis, and refused to acknowledge allegations against other named teachers and DOCS workers. - He stated that it was not a crime for Gary Willis to constantly call an Aboriginal child ‘coon,’ ‘ nigger’ and ‘the black snake.’ - He stated that he was immediately returning the file to the Education Department and closing the investigation, without contacting any other people or witnesses named in the file. I complained about Bob Sullivan in writing to the Prime Minister, the Police Integrity Commission, and the NSW Ombudsman. On 7 February 2005, I received a phone call from Kim McKay, Commander of the Child Protection and Sex Crimes Squad. Commander McKay stated that Bob Sullivan was currently on sick leave and that stress accounted for his inappropriate behaviour toward me and DM. Commander McKay stated that the Sex Crimes Squad would not be conducting an investigation into the Education Department’s allegat ions of criminal misconduct on the part of Gary Willis and other teaching staff. She stated that this was because Bob Sullivan had assessed the file and determined the case did not meet their criteria for investigation. Commander McKay added that the Sex Crimes Squad was already investigating 600 other cases. Commander McKay stated that Bob Sullivan alone made this decision and that she had not read the file herself. I suggested that if Bob Sullivan’s functioning was impaired at the time he assessed the Gary Willis case, then perhaps the case should be reassessed by a medically fit, stress -free, police officer. Commander McKay denied this request. She neglected to explain why the Gary Willis case did not meet the Sex Crime Squad’s criteria for investigation. Commander McKay told me that I must report everything else I knew about the alleged Tweed Heads pedophile ring, or else I could be charged with an offence called ‘Concealing a Crime’. This seemed an odd statement, given Bob Sullivan had refused to accept any further information about the case and McKay had just told me that NSW police were not prepared to investigate the information they had already received. But, as instructed, I handed over the following information: - I reported a female teacher who allegedly regularly took two female high school students for the weekend. (One of these students later died from complications following an operation which she underwent soon after her breasts suddenly became engorged.) - I reported that one set of parents had tr ied to have a female special needs teacher charged for allegedly sexually assaulting their son. - I reported that a male Murwillumbah High School special needs teacher's aide allegedly regularly took a male student home for lunchtime sex.

In a letter (dated 9 February 2005) Commander Kim McKay wrote to me: As a result of my inquiries I have established that there is a disparity between yourself and Detective Bob Sullivan on a number of the issues you have raised and are unable to determine where the truth lies. However I acknowledge that if Detectiv e Bob Sullivan did ask you if you were a victim of sexual assault, then this was inappropriate and should not have been said. In relation to the manner in which he addressed you I have found that this also was not always appropriate in the circumstances. O n behalf of the New South Wales Police Force I apologise for this occurrence. Parents complained to the NSW Ombudsman concerning the NSW police's refusal to investigate the alleged Tweed Shire pedophile ring. Consequently, in a letter dated 18 November 20 04, a Detective Sergeant M.N. Robinson of Byron Bay informed us that Detective Sergeant Brett Greentree of Tweed Heads Police station had been assigned to investigate Gary Willis and that witnesses were to contact him and make formal statements at the Twee d Heads police station. Five of Gary Willis’ former students were prepared to make statements to the Tweed Heads police. Three of these witnesses were intellectually disabled (ID). I had already contacted the Intellectual Disability Rights Service (IDRS) f or legal advice and asked them to supply a support person to attend the Tweed Heads police interviews with three ID witnesses, including Y. The IDRS lawyer, named Tamara, informed me that their service had trained Joint Investigation Response Teams (JIRT) police officers to interview ID witnesses, including adults. The lawyer also said that the current police policy and procedures stated that Tweed Heads police must initiate contact with JIRT regarding the three ID witnesses. However, when we contacted Ballina JIRT, an officer called Melissa Williams told me that no JIRT police officer was trained to interview intellectually disabled people. She also stated that JIRT refused to interview the three disabled witnesses because they were now adults. One of my in itial contacts, Detective Murray Baker at Tweed Heads, said he could not understand why Ballina JIRT would not touch the historical material, because they do ‘all the time.’"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 121 When I complained to Commander Kim McKay about JIRT refusing to interview ID adults, she stated to me that not one police officer in the whole of NSW had been specifically trained to interview intellectually disabled victims of sexual assault. This, of course, flew right in the face of the statements by IDRS lawyer Tamara. Commander McK ay, however, attempted to placate me by saying that Brett Greentree could be trusted to interview the three disabled victims because he was ex -JIRT (with two years’ experience) and because he was ‘a nice bloke with good intentions.’ NSW Education Department employee Sandra Cameron arranged with Brett Greentree to be present at the witnesses’ formal police interviews. Ms Cameron allegedly told a parent that she must attend her daughter’s interview with police because she represented the Department and so had to be sure the police questioning was fair to the Department. Ms Cameron subsequently insisted on attending the police interview, even after the parent told her not to. Ms Cameron told another parent that she planned to attend the police intervie ws so that she did not have to conduct independent interviews. The IDRS lawyer responded that it was ludicrous for a NSW Education Department representative to attend a police interview where a victim was making a statement and an allegation against the NSW Education Department. Tamara explained that if Sandra Cameron spoke during the interview, it could render the interview inadmissible in court. I arranged for an IDRS support person to attend the police interviews with the three disabled witnesses, but De tective Sergeant Greentree refused to allow this. I also specifically requested that Brett Greentree video the interviews, but he refused to do this. To the knowledge of victims and concerned parents, NSW police never investigated our complaints, Gary Will is was never charged with any of the reported crimes and victims were never given the chance to claim compensation for their child abuse experiences. A Gun to the Head Following my whistle blowing efforts against what I allege was a pedophile ring in the Tweed Shire, I came under increasing threat from parents, the local police force and various government authorities. The threat began subtly with offers of free ‘counselling’ from the NSW Department of Education. Owing to the increasing number of telephone threats, my mother answered my phone. ‘This must be very stressful for Fiona, ’ the Education Department counsellor spoke consolingly. But after my mother politely declined the woman’s invitation, her manner changed. The counsellor called repeatedly, each time sounding increasingly frustrated and angry at my refusing her ‘ services. ’ At the same time, my telephone provider informed me that my phone was tapped. Two other whistleblowing parents complained that their phones had been bugged also. Certain parents who had previously been helpful and collaborative with the whistle - blowing process suddenly began threatening other whistleblowing parents and me. ‘ZZ,’ the mother of East Murwillumbah victim L, phoned me in a hysterical state. She demanded that I give her the numbers and addresses of all the witnesses to Gary Willis’ abuse of children, particularly her daughter. She swore at me and told me she’d sue my ‘fucking arse’ if I did not stop pursuing the Gary Willis matter. She said she would hire a private detective and track everyone down."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 122 When I said it was too late and that the evidence had been forwarded on to the Education Department, she accused me of not having given he r the opportunity to view the evidence and discuss her views on the whole matter. ‘I phoned you weeks ago and gave you that chance, ’ I reminded her. ZZ screamed at me: ‘I don’t want to be dragged through no fucking kangaroo court again! My daughter was examined under a general anaesthetic and they found she was still a virgin! ’ I explained that someone can be sexually assaulted without damaging the hymen, but ZZ concluded with a tirade of abuse. I was advised to phone a parent ‘FF’ for information about the alleged abuse of her daughter ‘ GG.’ FF had worked at South Tweed Primary School for 18 years. She told me: ‘I’ve been waiting for your call ... It would be best if you handed all those statements back to the parents and don’t implicate yourself further, as this could get bad for your stress levels.’ One whistleblowing parent (‘ AF’) began receiving phone calls from ZZ who would phone and say, ‘Fucking bitch!’ and then hang up. ZZ told AF to retract her statement. She referred to AF’s poor state of health and to the fact that I was pregnant. When AF said she was not going to retract her statement, ZZ became aggressive, illogical, and spewed profanity at AF. ZZ added: ‘You’re disturbing Al Gudgeon’s retirement. How could you do this, as he has done so much for the community and for children? What happened all those years ago has nothing to do with what is happening today.’ My own daughter attended Banora Point P ublic School. I attended a P&C meeting at the school and raised the alarm about Gary Willis. I warned parents and teachers not to employ Gary Willis at our school — the only place he had not worked at in our area. Attendees, including the treasurer David DeClosey and his police officer friend, became visibly angry at me and verbally attacked me in the meeting. Following that, DeClosey and the police officer attended the P&C Federation’s Annual Conference. Upon their return, DeClosey passed on a threat to me. A NSW Education Department representative at the conference, he said, had told him to warn me to stop talking about Gary Willis — or else the NSW Education Department would sue me for defamation. After this, the threats became more tangible. To begin wit h, the P&C police officer issued me a hefty parking fine for something which, as my daughter’s teacher testified in writing, I simply did not do. The threats became physical. The RSPCA turned up at my house following a false report of pet neglect. When my fat, happy dog greeted him, the inspector remarked: ‘He’s fine. ’ Next, a health and safety officer turned up at my house following a false report that my builder was using a ramset gun while unlicensed. Then police turned up at my house following a false report that there was a stolen vehicle parked in my garage. On several occasions, Tweed Heads police drove slowly by my house, glaring menacingly at me. Heartbreakingly, my ‘neglected’ dog was dragged beneath our fence and killed, and my pet chickens and ducks were also found slaughtered. On one occasion, I reported to police that the 13 -year-old child of my neighbour had been driving his father’s car at excessive speeds on the highway and had near backed into my car. The petite blonde officer who responde d to my complaint failed to identify herself. She"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 123 verbally abused me for making the complaint, called me a ‘shit-stirrer, ’ and slapped me with an AVO from the juvenile’s father. In the end, I paid $14,000 to successfully challenge the spurious AVO. My husband and mother subsequently attended a meeting with Superintende nt Tim J. Tarlinton to discuss our concerns regarding the increasing threats against our family. Tarlinton treated my family with hostility and contempt. I began to feel so threatened by Tweed Heads police that I took my 10-month-old baby and six-year-old child into hiding for the next six weeks. My suspicions were justified days later when Tweed Heads police dispatched five squad cars to ambush my home at 5 Anthony Avenue and two relatives’ homes in Laura Street, Banora Point. My accountant husband, due to fly interstate for a work conference, pre -booked a taxi to the Gold Coast airport. Three squad cars followed the taxi, which pulled up on the highway just south of the Queensland/NSW border. The taxi driver told my husband to exit his vehicle. Police, dressed in vests, thrust three loaded semi-automatic weapons at my husband’s head, ordered him face down on the side of the highway and handcuffed him. Five months later, I received the letter fr om the NSW Education Department informing me that they had banned Gary Willis from teaching in the NSW public system. I then discovered that Superintendent Tarlinton had retired from his position as Local Area Commander and Brett Greentree had been transfe rred to Bourke on a promotion to Detective Inspector. Yet my victimisation at the hands of Tweed Heads police did not end there. The petite blonde female officer returned in 2012, unidentified and armed with handcuffs and a weapon, to arrest me. Some stran ger had illegally parked a trailer on my front lawn and reported that it was damaged while left there unattended. Instead of issuing a $180 fine for the illegal park, the police officer sought to arrest me. Hand clasped on her gun, the officer rang my fron t door bell. My mother answered. ‘Where is she?! ’ the officer hissed. But I had already fled with my family for the third time since blowing the whistle on the alleged Tweed Shire pedophile ring. It then struck me: the NSW police force displayed more conce rn for an illegally parked trailer, rather than an unfathomed number of young, disabled children who were assaulted and mentally scarred by a violent sexual predator. So many questions remain. Where is Gary Willis today? Does he have contact with children? Why were the whistle -blowers, including me, being ostracised and victimised, while the alleged perpetrators were seemingly being protected by the NSW Police. Why did the NSW Police seem so disinterested in investigating an alleged pedophile network, in which there was numerous witnesses and a wealth of documentary evidence? Does this suggest that network extends beyond the Education Department and into the police? And does it extend even further than that? * * * "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 124 After being banned from employment in NSW, Gary Willis was hired by the Queensland Education Department to work at Tallebudgera Primary School on the Gold Coast.

Former student Fiona Barnett says the rot at the University goes deep. Bond University was founded by Australia’s most notorious corporate criminal, Alan Bond. As disgruntled students have discovered, Alan Bond structured the private organisation so it evades public accountability — despite the fact the university accesses public funds in the form of student loans. Bond University’s lack of public accountability stems in part from the fact that it is not actually a university but rather a corporation legally permitted to borrow the title ‘university.’ I undertook postgraduate psychology studies at Bond University from 2006 to 2007, and again from 2009 to 2010. In 2013, I reported Bond University to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse . My complaint contained a long list of offences in relation to the cover -up of pedophile activities, pro-paedophilia course content, the misuse of students’ personal child abuse histories, and the sexual harassment and assault of students by certain lecturers. High-profile psychologist damns Bond University I provided the Royal Commission with the transcript of legally obtained recordings of Bob Montgomery, previous president of the APS (Australian Psychological Society) and former Head of Psychology at Bond University. Dr Montgomery described Bond as follows: It is one of the worst run universities I’ve ever seen. It’s dishonest. It’s been dishonest all the time I’ve known it... Bond University will do all the skul lduggerous things they can to deny any mis-practice... While I was there, they had a lunatic professor of psychology.... He was caught screwing his secretary on the desk. The outcome was he sacked the se cretary and the vice -chancellor backed him up... So, you might have a realistic concern if you enrol for an externship that they may try to manipulate the situation in some way to try and put you in a bad light. And you’ve got to put that in your decision-making mix... If you decide to plough ahead with Bond University. you will be dealing with people who are out to get you, nasty, willing to do dishonest things, and getting increasingly desperate because not only have they not knocked you down, but you’re coming back even stronger. Bond University covers -up child sexual abuse While working in the Bond University Psychology Clinic, a 10-year-old DOCS client and her foster mother disclosed to me that a former foster carer and convicted pedophile had sexually assaulted my client, along with other children. In direct contravention of Queensland legislation regarding the concealment of child abuse, Bond University forbade me from"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 126 reporting these crimes to the police. I persuaded one lecturer to let me inform the Queensland Children's Commissioner of the allegations. Bond University, however, subsequently withdrew my complaint to the Commissioner without my knowledge and then lied to the Commissioner by saying they had done so in consultation with me. While the Commissioner upheld my complaint and proceeded with an investigation, Bond University chastised me and said my complaint jeopardised their relationship with the DOCS office, upon which they relied for clients to keep the Bond Psychology Clinic running. Bond University’s pro -paedophilia teachings In 2013, I asked the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse to investigate Bond University with respect to its pro-paedophilia teachings. These teachings include the writings of a psychology and criminology lecturer, and Order of Australia medal recipient, Professor Paul Wilson, who served as Dean of Humanities at Bond University for 10 years. In one of his books, subtitled Sexual Experiences between Men and Boys , the professor promoted the benefits of paedophilia and renaming this crime ‘Greek love. ’ The professor also published articles on Bond University’s website, which stated that children are often willing participants in child sexual abuse. (The Royal Commission gasped when I read that fact out.) In late 2012, Paul Wilson was charged with six counts of indecent dealings with two girls — one of whom was under 12 years old. In May 2014, he was committed to stand trial. The same professor taught me at Bond University. He and othe r Bond lecturers, in my view, encouraged a strong anti-victim/pro-perpetrator stance in their classes. For example, one lecturer endorsed the notion that technically there is no such thing as a victim of crime because a criminal case involves the defendant versus the crown instead of the defendant versus a victim. On another occasion, I had marks deducted for briefly mentioning a victim’s perspective in an essay. Bond University lecturers strongly endorsed the flawed ‘false memory syndrome' writings of USA psychologist Elizabeth Loftus. The Royal Commission commended my submission against Loftus’ writings and my condemnation of her association with the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF). The FMSF was founded by Peter Freyd and his wife (and stepsister) Pamela after their daughter, Professor Jennifer Freyd, accused Peter of child sexual abuse. Apart from founding the FMSF, Peter has publicly endorsed paedophilia as a responsible lifestyle choice and allowing siblings to marry. The effect of the FMSF has been to discredit child abuse witness testimony and the existence of well organised pedophile rings. Bond University sexually harasses students Bond University has a history of sexually harassing students. During my 2009-10 enrolment, the following incidents occurred: a postgraduate student handed out pamphlets on campus alleging that a senior staff member had sexually harassed him and that the university had engaged in cult-like practises; a female lecturer offered a teenage girl who was on scholarship, sex in exchange for good grades; and a male lecturer offered a legal minor, also on scholarship, sex in exchange for good grades. The girl’s father, a lawyer, threatened to lodge a complaint with the AHRC ( Australian Human Rights Commission ). In an effort to placate the family, Bond University offered the girl a transfer to her preferred Sydney"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 127 University. I witnessed a Bond University lecturer regularly throw parties at her house, during which students were supplied copious amounts of alcohol. I also saw the lecturer instigate a game of ‘sexual disclosure’ spin-the -bottle with her students. Bond University pressures students to disclose child abuse histories Bond University psychology staff exhibited a pattern of obtaining students’ personal information, whi ch they would then use to hold students to ransom if they complained about their Bond experience. I witnessed lecturers’ concerted efforts to bait a fellow student into disclosing her child abuse history to them. ‘She came so close to disclosing!’ one lect urer told me on one occasion, in a state of high excitement. I was pressured to disclose my personal history of child sexual abuse to Bond University lecturers during psychological supervision and while socialising with lecturers in their homes and also at my home. According to my understanding, the lecturers’ abuse of their authority, and their pressuring of me to disclose personal information, constituted a breach of the APS Code of Ethics and Guidelines. During my studies, I was sexually harassed by a Bond University staff member My experience of sexual harassment occurred in response to the disclosure of my child sexual abuse. The same lecturer tricked me into sleeping in her bed at a student party, described my breasts as ‘magnificent, ’ before grabbing one and massaging it in a sexual manner. Bond University Lecturer Katarina F ritzon’s inappropriate email showing her grooming behaviour."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 128 Formal Complaints against Bond University I rejected a Bond University lecturer’s unwanted sexual advances and complained to Bond University and to the Psychology Board. I also lodged a complaint of sexual harassment and disability discrimination with the Australian Human Rights Commission , which upheld my entire complaint. The disability discrimination section of my complaint related to a visual cortex stroke I suffered during the fifth week of my masters program. Lecturers used my subsequent disability as a means of harassing me. Staff refused to adhere to the conditions se t out by my Bond University disability support officer — consequently, I suffered further damage to my vision. Bond staff subjected me to extreme bullying and harassment, including exclusion and placing me under excessive scrutiny. For example, a staff me mber verbally abused a student peer and reduced her to tears for inviting me to her private engagement party. This victimisation intensified following my initial complaint to the Psychology Board and following my attempts to adhere to mandatory reporting legislation in relation to child abuse disclosure in the university’s psychology clinic. Bond University’s Corruption In October 2010, to subdue an adversary process I had in place against staff at the time, Bond University staff lodged a vexatious and unsubstantiated notification against me to the Psychology Board, which is administered by AHPRA ( Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency ). Bond University staff simultaneously pooled the information they had gleaned about my own childhood sexual abuse. They removed the age I was during the time of my child abuse and reported me as an adult perpetrator instead of a child victim of the same crimes to AHPRA and to the NSW police. An (11/11/2010) email from AHPRA to a senior Queensland police detective w ho lectures at Bond University stated: It has come to my attention that Ms Barnett is under investigation by police following serious allegations of a criminal nature... if you have any information which may be imperative to the assessment of Ms Barnett’s h ealth, please do not hesitate to contact me. The police officer then (26/11/2010) sent the following email to AHPRA from his Bond University email account: The last briefing I had was that contact had been made with NSWPOL and they could not identify any outstanding jobs that would match the claims made. They also informed us that the suspect had previously made outlandish claims of a similar nature. The investigation is ongoing but given the above I would suspect it will not be a police matter. A second (27/11/10) email from police to AHPRA said: "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 129 At this stage we are unable to find any evidence to what MS BARNETT is saying. MS BARNETT has previously made similar admissions to NSW police in 2008, this investigation was finalised as no evidence could be located to substantiate what MS BARNETT has stated. AHPRA used the above correspondence as evidence I was a criminal, as detailed in their 29 March 2011 letter to me: ...confirmation of similar reported events by the NSW Police Service regarding past criminal activities of a serious nature is a matter that the Board will need to address. I sent written complaints about these emails to the NSW and Queensland police ministers. Both ministers denied that NSW police provided any information to AHPRA in suppor t of Bond University’s accusation that I was a perpetrator of crimes. So, either police lied to their ministers about providing emails to AHPRA, or AHPRA fabricated evidence against me. Bond University staff lied to AHPRA by alleging that I had suddenly be came psychotic at an unspecified time, somewhere between the second and third field placements I did as part of my masters program. They simultaneously treated my child abuse history as both: (a) real (i.e., evidence of my alleged criminality), and (b) fictitious (i.e., the product of my alleged sudden psychosis). Bond University accused me of 'decompensating into psychosis' — despite me having no history or symptoms of psychosis whatsoever. They made this claim without consulting the only Bond employees who had regular contact with me during the time that this ‘mental illness’ was supposedly manifesting — my two external supervisors. Dr Gavan Palk (barrister and chair of the APS Forensic College) supervised my second practicum, during which he saw me four hours per week for three months. Dr Norm Barling, who was Bond University’s Clinical Director for 20 years, supervised my third practicum. Both supervisors wrote me glowing references that made a mockery of Bond’s notification. For instance, Dr Palk wrote : Ms Barnett impressed as an extremely intelligent person with excellent written and oral skills. She has exceptional writing skills and her psychological reports were very thorough and well written. She demonstrated that she could integrate her clinical experience of clients with objective test results. Her opinions were sound and followed logically from the evidence she gathered through testing and interviews. In regards to interactions with clients, Ms Barnett demonstrated that she was able to develop and maintain a therapeutic alliance with clients. She also demonstrated a solid command of micro counselling skills and sensitivity to client’s needs. Her approach towards clients was very professional and she had no difficulty in analysing problems, undertaking appropriate research background forming hypotheses, planning and carrying out psychological interventions... "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 130 In conclusion, it was a pleasure to provide supervision to Ms Barnett. She is a passionate and intelligent person who has persevered in spite of her health difficulties. The writer is very confident that Fiona has the makings of a very fine psychologist and she should be encouraged to undertake a PhD in the area of sensory processing and intellectual giftedness. All of Bond University’s vague accusations were easily and completely disproved by written evidence, including emails, and letters from witnesses and health professionals that I submitted to AHPRA. Most telling, Bond University had already passed me, over one year prior to the false and vexatious notification in the very subjects during which the alleged ethical breaches were said to have occurred. Further, Dr Barling pointed out that if Bond staff had any concerns about my mental health prior to my commencing the third practicum, then ethically and legally they were not permitted to allow me to commence a third work placement — which, of course, they had done. Bond University submitted to AHPRA and the AHRC a written confession that a Bond lecturer had students attend a sleepove r at her house in 2007 — an act which, alone, constituted an alleged breach of the APS Ethical Code and Guidelines. In this same document, the lecturer lied by alleging I was not enrolled in Bond University at the time of her 2007 party, when academic transcripts clearly show I was, indeed, enrolled. Despite my excellent academic history – including a grade of 89% in my final theory subject, Psychopharmacology – and with only two subjects to complete before obtaining my Master of Psychology degree. Bond University wrote 'withdrawn' on my academic transcript. They then failed to grant me a right of reply to their action and forbade me from accessing their appeals system. As a consequence, I was robbed of six years of study and close to $100,000 I paid in student loans. And since I was no longer enrolled in a psychology course, AHPRA immediately cancelled my student psychology registration. Bond University’s double standards In 2013, Bond University staff allegedly severely breached privacy legislation and ethical standards in the execution of a research project into autism (Project Number RO - 1516). The project’s approved recruitment protocol was for parents to be invited to participate in the study via emails sent from Gold Coast Autism Inc. Instead, the Queensland Education Department provided Bond University with the names, medical history and contact details of state school students who are registered with the department as having autism — without the parents’ knowledge or consent. One parent told me, Bond University contacted her on a Saturday via her private mobile. When the mother confronted her school principal, he said he knew nothing about the research project. If true, this ethical breach is monumental and far surpasses the petty ethical breaches that they falsely accused me of committing. For instance, Bond reported me to AHPRA for 'upsetting a student' by appropriately borrowing a psychology test from the library. Unbeknownst to me, the student (whom I had never met) wanted the test I had borrowed. The student, who had a history of aggressive behaviour and who had allegedly attracted formal student complaints, stormed in on my client session in the Psychology Clinic and demanded I immediately cease working with my client and give him the test. Despite the fact my supervisor informed me, via email, that he"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 131 reported the student to the Psychology Board, one year later Bond staff reported me to AHPRA for the very same incident. Bond University audited Because of Bond University’s private status, they prove d unaccountable to every government body to which a similarly offended student at a public university might be able to appeal. Bond is supposedly answerable to the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC), the national body that accredits psychology courses. In March 2011, APAC commenced an audit of Bond University in response to alleged multiple breaches of APAC Standards. Bond had previously lost accreditation for similar breaches in 2007/2008. In response to this audit, Bond employed yet anothe r organisational psychologist to conduct student interviews. However, aggrieved students were actively denied access to this investigation. APAC intervened and virtually begged a fellow offended student and me to attend the interviews. APAC assured us that multiple students had supported and validated our complaints against Bond. In the end, APAC and the APS did nothing to assist me in my fight for justice and vindication. In a letter to the AHRC, Bond University documented and criticised my attendance at the APAC interviews. In this letter, they stated that APAC did not take my testimony seriously. Immediately following the APAC audit, two Bond Psychology Clinic administrators lodged internal complaints against one offending psychology lecturer for her misconduct and her mistreatment of me and other psychology students. Bond University then pressured that lecturer to resign. The main offending lecturers remain employed at Bond University. * * * AHPRA PROTECTS ALLEGED SEX OFFENDERS Fiona Barnett, Independent Australia , 3 November 2014. After Fiona Barnett was bullied out of her Bond University psychology course, health regulator AHPRA treated her case with a curious mixture of incredible incompetence and callous contempt. In theory, the role of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) is to oversee the administration of our medical, psychology and other health profession boards. They are supposed to protect the public from malpractice, while simultaneously offering a level of protection for innocent health professionals against vexatious and unsubstantiated complaints. In 2011, a Senate Committee Inquiry was conducted into AHPRA. The Inquiry’s findings were damning. The resultant report stated: 6.19 In rel ation to complaints about health practitioners, the committee identified a number of areas where improvements are required including inconsistencies in application of complaint processes ... and the way in which vexatious complaints are handled."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 132 6.32 ... the mistakes, omissions and poor processes that were clearly evident from the evidence received during the inquiry calls into question the ability of AHPRA to carry out its primary purpose. For AHPRA itself to be responsible for a breakdown of the entire system of registration of health practitioners in Australia is a dismal example of policy implementation and public administration. The Senate Inquiry identified the Queensland AHPRA office as Australia’s most incompetent state office. You might expect, following such a finding, that the Queensland AHPRA office may have addressed the Inquiry’s criticisms and implemented some changes. Unfortunately, if you did, you would be wrong. AHPRA exploits student's child abuse history My personal child abuse experiences formed the basis for Bond University’s notification against me. My abuse constituted grounds for Bond’s allegation that I was ‘impaired’ and posed a risk to the public. This was despite no explained link between my having experienced child abuse 30+ years ago and my alleged impairment. AHPRA cited my personal child abuse history as evidence that I was psychotic and a criminal. The obvious anomaly in their argument was that they used my personal testimony as being a symptom of psychosis, then the y simultaneously employed my testimony as a basis for contacting the police and accusing me of criminal activity. It is difficult to understand how my testimony could simultaneously be both a product of my imagination and a physical reality. After making a FOI (Freedom of Information) application, I obtained the following emails showing that AHPRA communicated with police in both NSW and Queensland. Two email exchanges identified a senior detective who worked for the Gold Coast CIB and who also lectured at Bond University. The first email (dated 11/11/2010) from AHPRA to the Queensland police officer was addressed to his Bond University email: ‘It has come to my attention that Ms Barnett is under investigation by police following serious allegations of a cr iminal nature ... if you have any information which may be imperative to the assessment of Ms Barnett’s health, please do not hesitate to contact me.’ The second email (dated 26/11/10) from the Bond University lecturer to AHPRA stated: The last briefing I had was that contact had been made with NSWPOL and they could not identify any outstanding jobs that would match the claims made. They also informed us that the suspect had previously made outlandish claims of a similar nature. The investigation is ongoin g but given the above I would suspect it will not be a police matter. This letter documents that police dismissed my testimony as ‘outlandish,’ despite: - Possessing Tor Nielsen’s collaborative witness testimony prior to my contacting them. - Never having collected a comprehensive statement from me."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 133 - Having assigned a task force to investigate a pedophile ring at the institution where I had been abused (Engadine BoysTown). Another email (dated 27/11/10) from police to AHPRA stated: At this stage we are unable to find any evidence to what MS BARNETT is saying. MS BARNETT has previously made similar admissions to NSW police in 2008, this investigation was finalised as no evidence could be located to substantiate what MS BARNETT has stated. I was never interviewed with regard to the allegations I made to police. AHPRA used the above correspondence as evidence I was a criminal, as recorded in their letter (dated 29/3/11) and addressed to me, which said: ...confirmation of similar reported events by the NSW Po lice Service regarding past criminal activities of a serious nature is a matter that the Board will need to address. I sent written complaints about these emails to the NSW and Queensland police commissioners. Both police commissioners denied that NSW police provided any information to AHPRA in support of Bond University’s accusation that I was a perpetrator of crimes. So, either police lied to their ministers about providing emails to AHPRA or AHPRA fabricated evidence against me. I submitted the two police ministers’ response letters, plus comprehensive evidence which clearly disproved Bond University’s allegations against me. I submitted these to Queensland AHPRA’s state manager. AHPRA use health assessment to ‘stitch up ’ student On the basis of Bond University’s vexatious and unsubstantiated notification, AHPRA ordered me to attend a health assessment. Several professional sources warned me not to attend this assessment. These sources included a high-profile psychiatrist who warned me that AHPRA had employed a notorious ‘creep ’ psychiatrist to ‘stitch [me] up.’ Patient feedback on a social media site described the ‘hired gun’ as ‘likes to humiliate patients.’ My own GP also warned me not to attend AHPRA’s health assessment. One close personal contact, who drafts legislation for the Queensland Government, warned me that archaic Queensland legislation permitted AHPRA’s ‘hired gun’ health assessor to decide I was psychotic even if I was not, call police without my family’s knowledge, drug me and admit me to a psychiatric hospital. She said AHPRA had far reaching powers, including the authority to enter my home and remove my personal belongings. She studied the new Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (Qld) 2009 (referred to hereafter as the Health Act) and concluded that it had been poorly written, failing to include penalties for my refusing to attend an AHPRA health assessment. She then advised me not to attend the assessment. The multiple warnings not to attend AHPRA’s health assessment seemed va lid considering: - What happened to Tor Nielsen when he attended a similar assessment in Sydney. - The damning findings of the 2011 Senate Committee Inquiry into AHPRA."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 134 - AHPRA’s multiple breaches of legislation in their administration of Bond University’s vexatious notification against me. AHPRA Breach Health Act 2009 AHPRA breached the Health Act by, for example, demanding I pay the costs associated with their health assessment. They sent me multiple ‘Authority’ forms to sign, which said: I, Fiona Barnett hereby authorise the following practitioner to provide information as requested by the Psychology Board regarding my current and past medical condition. I agree to accept responsibility for any costs associated with the production of this information. Notably, AHPRA omitted their ‘Authority’ form from my released FOI file. This direction from AHPRA overrode a general provision made in Section 171(4) of the Health Act which states: ‘The assessor’s fee for carrying out the assessment is to be paid out of the National Board’s budget.’ AHPRA violates APS Code of Ethics On 29 November 2010, a fellow Bond University student and I submitted a joint notification to AHPRA against several Bond University lecturers. The other student had an unblemished 10-year career as a psychologist and a supervisor. AHPRA refused to action our joint notification. The health regulator stated its reasons for refusing to act were: the other student and I were not classified as clients in receipt of psychological services; and since AHPRA was less than a year old, it had not had time to adopt the APS Code of Ethics and Guidelines. AHPRA’s failure to recognise Bond psychology students as recipients of psychological services seems to breach section 5 of the Act, which clearly classifies health education as a health service of which psychology students are recipients. Back in 2009, the Psychologists Board of Queensland had already sent me a letter saying: ...the Board endorses the Australian Psychological Society’s APS Code of Ethic s and the APS Ethical Guidelines. The Board is guided by, though not limited to, these documents when assessing the professional conduct of registrants. The letter shows that the definition of students as clients preceded AHPRA. This definition should have been implemented regardless of whether the administration of the Psychology Board had problems transitioning from a state to a national scheme. In any case, AHPRA’s failure to apply the APS Code of Ethics breaches s40 of the Health Act, which deems AHPRA to have adopted the APS Code of Ethics when it first appeared on the AHPRA website in 2010. Meanwhile, AHPRA stated they had employed the very same APS Ethical Code and Guidelines in their administration of Bond’s vexatious and unsubstantiated notificat ion against me. On 29/3/11, they wrote: "},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 135 The Board has adopted the Australian Psychological Society’s Code of Ethics for the profession and should an investigation be commenced into the conduct and professional standards of Ms Barnett, the Code will be the standard against which the concerns will be assessed. Since Bond University’s notification arrived prior to my joint student notification against Bond, this order of events makes a mockery of AHPRA’s argument — that they were too new and disorganised to apply the APS Code of Ethics to a joint student notification against Bond University. AHPRA condones unprofessional conduct Bond University psychology lecturers should be held accountable according to the APS Code of Ethics and Guidelines regardless of whether psychology students are labelled ‘clients’ or ‘colleagues.’ AHPRA’s lack of action against Bond University psychology lecturers would appear to be inconsistent with the Health Act’s definition of ‘unprofessional conduct’, which is sta ted to mean: ‘... professional conduct that is of a lesser standard than that which might reasonably be expected of the health practitioner by the public or the practitioner's professional peers.’ It is difficult to imagine that the public would approve of psychologists and lecturers having parties with students, supplying students with alcohol, and then sexually assaulting students while they are under its influence of alcohol and asleep. It is also difficult to imagine that professional peers would condone Bond University’s lack of adherence to mandatory reporting requirements. AHPRA deny due process and natural justice In a letter (dated 4/1/11) AHPRA admitted that it operates in accordance with principles of natural justice. Natural justice dictates that an individual (where allegations are to be made against that individual) is entitled to know precisely what those allegations are and the facts upon which it is said those allegations arise. However, AHPRA failed to tell me the basis for the allegations of unsatisfactory conduct and professional standards, criminal behaviour, being impaired and of posing a risk to the public. Consequently, AHPRA failed to act in accordance with the principles of natural justice. AHPRA deprived me of my right to due process and my right to be heard. I was denied correct information and legal consultation. AHPRA denied me the opportunity to respond to Bond University’s allegation I was ‘psychotic’ and a ‘criminal.’ They consistently denied me the chance to submit an initial right of reply to Bond’s notification. Despite multiple requests, AHPRA failed to provide me with sufficient information concerning the content of Bond’s notification against me so that I could actually compose a right of reply. To access any informa tion, I had to struggle to obtain my AHPRA file under FOI provisions. AHPRA directed me to attend substance abuse testing (including urinalysis) when I have no history of substance abuse and when no reference to an alleged substance abuse problem was made in the Bond University notification. Nor were there any reference to substance abuse in any of the 200 pages of my AHPRA file released via FOI."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 136 AHPRA tried to bully, threaten and railroad me into quickly complying with their unlawful and unfair administration of a vexatious notification. AHPRA demonstrated bias, provided me with confusing and contradictory instructions, withheld crucial information and misrepresented me to the Queensland Psychology Board. AHPRA set me impossible deadlines, carrying negative consequences and threatened me with action that could result in financial loss, loss of professional registration, loss of reputation and deprivation of liberty. AHPRA reneges on agreement AHPRA eventually said that I could substitute their psychiatric assessment with a private medical report. My GP referred me to a high-profile psychiatrist for a specialist report. I paid thousands of dollars for a comprehensive medical report, in which the psychiatrist concluded that I had no mental health disorder. He reported that the only thing I needed counselling for was the mistreatment and subsequent stress to which Bond University had subjected me. AHPRA rejected the privately acquired medical report. AHPRA then mysteriously gave me back my registration. Then they took it away again. This yo-yo approach was typical of Queensland AHPRA. Several staff displayed a sarcastic and abusive phone manner. Written communication suggested that certain AHPRA staff enjoyed overstepping professional boundaries at my expense. Complaint Tampering by Federal Agency AHPRA’s administration is answerable to the National Health Practitioner Ombudsman . I submitted a complaint against AHPRA, plus a request for an administrative review, to the National Ombudsman. I sent my comprehensive complaint and evidence via registered post. Despite my receiving a signed delivery confirmation slip, the ombudsman’s administrator told me that their office never received my complaint. The office ignored my follow-up emails, emailed complaint submission, phone calls and recorded messages. I then formally complained about my missing parcel to Australia Post, who concluded that it ‘must have been lost.’ Conclusion Queensland AHPRA’s actions against me ‒ an innocent student and victim of crime ‒ indicate that nothing has changed to improve their professional operation since the damning findings of the 2011 Senate Committee Inquiry. As other Independent Australia contributors have long campaigned for, a Royal Commission is required to get to the bottom of the shonky – perhaps criminal – administration of health in Australia. * * * A Second Bond Psychology Lecturer Charged with Pedophilia Two Bond University Psychology professors were charged with historical pedophilia crimes after Bond’s Psychology faculty destroyed my Psychology career – PAUL WILSON AND Bob Montgomery. Bob Montgomery established the Bond P sychology program while Paul"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 137 Wilson was the Head of the Humanities Department. The two accused pedophile psychologists worked at Bond at the same time. Paul Wilson was prominent in Australia’s 1980s academic movement to legalise pedophilia. While lecturing at the University of Queensland, Wilson organised a pro- pedophilia conference which the university cancelled following public outcry , and he ‘accidentally’ showed a psychology class the end of a child porn snuff film. One student witness was the daughter of a Queensland police commissioner. Other students are now practising psychologists. Paul Wilson was friends with Queensland Police Commissioner Terry Lewis who kept a dirt file on him which surfaced during the Kimmin’s Report and found its way into the Fitzgerald Inquiry of the late 1980s. The Fitzgerald Inquiry was Queensland ’s version of the NSW Wood Royal Commission into government child sex trafficking, and similarly buried its crucial findings. In 1981, Paul Wilson wrote a book subtitled, The Man They Called a Monster: Sexual Experiences Between Men and Boys 93 which advocated for pedophilia to be renamed ‘Greek love’ and be socially accepted like in Ancient Greece. The book defended Wilson’s pedophile associate Clarence Henry Osborne, who maintained records of his 2,500 victims plus VIP pedophiles including academics like Paul Wilson. In 2016, Paul Wilson was sentenced to 6 months prison for the historical sexual assault of two young girls. A journalist, to whom I provided information for a Courier Mail feature story about the case, told me Paul Wilson had such a long list of victims waiting to prosecute him, he will spend the rest of his days either in court or prison. 93 Paul R.

Cassell."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 138 Bob Montgomery In 2019, Bob Montgomery was charged with sexually abusing and anally raping three young boys in the 1970s. Montgomery established psychology courses at two other universities besides Bond, including Alfred Conlon’s ANU in Canberra. Montgomery authored 13 books, regularly appeared on television and radio, and was the consultant psychologist on the Big Brother TV show. Montgomery was 2009 to 2010 President of the A PS who describe themselves as: ‘ ...the peak body for psychologists in Australia and represent over 24,000 members. We advocate for the profession of psychology, support high standards, promote community well-being, and are dedicated to providing benefits to support members.’ The APS certainly supported Bob Montgomery who received a ‘slap on the wrist’ for having sex with his client. Bob Montgomery headed unethical MK -ULTRA research conducted by LaTrobe University’s psychology department in 1973 to 1974. The Milgram replica experiments which tested a human’s willingness to fatally electrocute others left Montgomery’s subjects traumatised. LaTrobe University is home to Psychology lecturer Gary Dowsett who was part of academia’s 1980s push to legalise pedophilia. Until recently, Dowsett’s LaTrobe University resume page featured a link to an article he wrote in Gay Information Quar terly Journal (Spring 1982). Titled, Boiled Lollies and Band-Aids: Gay men and Kids, it stated: And a new political position is needed... First we have three legal/social questions to win: custody rights for gay men and lesbians; the legal right of pedophiles and their young lovers; and finally the sexual rights of children as a whole.... How different then is that gentle, tentative sexuality bet ween parent and child from the love of a pedophile and his/her lover?’ Gary Dowsett developed the Victorian Government’s Safe Schools sex education curriculum which, I heard from multiple sources, contained explicit pornography and resulted in boys gangraping girls at school. As stated in response to PIE’s 1976 campaign to lower the age of consent: ‘...what is called sex education differs from other subjects in that it may determine the immediate and future behaviour of children and change the whole climate of society.’ 94 The timing of Bob Montgomery's 1970s Milgram experiments coincides with Kidman's CIA-funded Learned Helplessness research that he conducted under Seli gman’s guidance. During the 1970s, Bob Montgomery was a visiting professor at the Universities of Hawaii and Oregon, MK-ULTRA research hubs. Kidman undertook a PhD in biochemistry at the University of Hawaii. Antony Kidman and Bob Montgomery both promoted CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) and Health Psychology in Australia. 'Health Psychology' was invented by Joseph Matarazzo who designed the 2001 torture program that Seli gman was second in charge of. An excerpt from a self-help book illustrates the perceived relationship between these men, and their denial teachings: 95 94 Ronald Butt (1976). Who really wants a change in the age of consent?

The only thing that varies is the intensity and the number of them we have. These unrealistic expectations we have form pictures in our mind that place us in inevitable conflict and cause, not just conflict but also cause sadness, even despair. Albert Ellis, Anthony Kidman and Bob Montgomery as well as several other authors have one thing in common, they refer in their books to these as the ‘irrational’ beliefs we have about ourselves. What follows is, in fact, the ten irrational beliefs so often quoted: . . . - Irrational Belief 3 : Some people are bad, wicked or evil, and they should be punished for this. . . - Irrational Belief 5 : My bad feelings are caused by something out of my control, so I can’t do anything about them. . . - Irrational Belief 9 : My problems were caused by some events in my past, so that’s why I have my problems now. Here is my rebuttal to these points: - Rational Belief 3 : Psychologists who rape and torture children are evil criminals who deserve to be brought to justice and punished to the full extent of the law. - Rational Belief 5 : My feelings stem from implicit memories of being hypnotised, drugged, raped, and brainwashed. My feelings are outside of my conscious control because they are a symptom of repressed abuse memories. My feelings will dissipate when I remember and process my abuse. - Rational Belief 9 : My current physical and psychological problems were certainly caused by my child abuse. Antony Kidman, Bob Montgomery, and Paul Wilson were three of Australia’s most prominent psychologists. Authors, university lecturers, and ABC media consultants, they used their positions to promote child abuse denial, stop victims processing their trauma memories, and mislead the public concerning the truth about organized child abuse in Australia. Not surprising if all three men were pedophiles. Another Bond University lecturer, Richard Hick s, was involved with MK -ULTRA research in the 1960s also. 96 * * * 96 R.E. Hicks & P.J. Fink (Eds.)

Bundaberg Several people independently described Bundaberg to me as ‘Satan’s throne.’ There is no denying the isolated country town is a microcosm of national coven activity, but why the Prince of Darkness would choose such a shithole for his throne room is beyond m e. Several variables lend credibility to the rumour. Bundaberg sits smack atop one of the major Ley-lines occultists prize. Another clue was the enormous road sign that confronted visitors at the town’s entrance. The blood red sign contained the black silhouette of a huge bull with tall erect horns. Superficially, the bull poster advertised the El Toro restaurant located in the nearby coastal suburb of Bargara. On a sinister level it represented the horned bull of Mithraism and it indicated that Bundaberg was a coven capital. Another of Bundaberg’s dark features is the leg endary Hummock. The Hummock is a hollow, extinct volcano that dominates the area’s otherwise flat landscape. The cavern inside the Hummock is accessed via a number of the homes that sit on the hill, homes which are only ever sold on to approved coven membe rs. Local Indigenous people said the Hummock features a natural tunnel system which joins the main enormous hollow to surrounding landmarks including the local Catholic school and cemetery. Luciferian rituals are said to take place beneath the impenetrable Hummock. Bundaberg is characterised by a lack of aesthetics, absence of culture and an obsession with sport. Its main street was once lined with iron laced heritage buildings and enormous trees that created a long cool green arch; but someone clad the buildings, and cut down every tree, creating a repulsive heat. In the early 1990s, a Bundaberg courthouse employee informed me that he processed one suicide per week. That statistic struck me as high, considering the town served a population of approximately 40,000. Bundaberg’s air of suicidal futility was well captured in the school war -cry that local children shared with me: ‘Sex! Drugs! Rock -n-roll! Bundy High’s a fuckin’ hole!’ If ever you want to know what is really happening in a community – ask the kids. The local children told me about the 26 primary school students being treated at the hospital’s psychiatric unit for the sexual and physical abuse they experienced at Bundaber g West State School, and which was eventually reported in the local paper. The kids informed me about the Bundaberg East State School principal who liked to watch children do cartwheels in their skirts, and who would force himself upon mothers in the school classrooms while they attended teacher interviews. The school cleaner complained to my Aunty Beryl that she would find semen all over the desks and floor. I attended this school for a while in Grade 6. The most telling testimony came to me in 1998 from Samantha, a Grade 7 student at Woongarra State School. Samantha was an attractive 12 -year-old with the body of a 16-year-"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 141 old and the mouth of a 22-year-old. I met Samantha during a local cricket game. She was staying with my friend who was providing respite to the girl’s mother. The ‘tween-ager’ was reportedly out of control and dating a man in his early twenties. For some reason, Samantha decided to tell me all about her life, including her involvement in ‘witchcraft.’ The child said that she was introduce d to witchcraft by her classmate whose house she often stayed at. In fact, her entire primary school class had been converted to witchcraft the previous year. ‘It was a really positive thing,’ Samantha explained, ‘because before that there was a lot of fig hting and bitchiness, but after we all became involved in witchcraft it united us, and we all got on really well.’ Samantha told me about how the class would cast spells on their teacher. One of these caused her teacher’s chair to break, while another caused the teacher’s car tyre to go flat. Apparently, it was really funny, and it gave the students a means of revenge against their ‘mean’ teacher. Samantha then revealed what she benefited from witchcraft – a sense of control over her out -of-control life. The child was angry. Two years ago, police found her grandmother dead, mysteriously slain with a fork – the common eating utensil kind. Samantha wanted revenge against an unknown entity. I listened patiently to Samantha for about two hours, quietly prompting . Once satisfied that the girl had shared everything, I made my stand. I looked the child dead in the eye and affirmed: ‘Now listen here and you listen well. You are playing with fire, missy! Right now, this whole witchcraft thing feels fun, but come your thirteenth birthday you will be initiated into the next step – which is not fun! Once you take that next step, you will reach a point of no return. The next level is human sacrifice where they murder little babies and children. Believe me, because I’ve seen it. I know it’s real, just as you know that magic really works. Take it from someone who has seen where all of this goes – stop now before it’s too late! This is your chance, right here, right now, to get out!’ Terror seized the girl’s being and she morphed back into a 12-year-old child. ‘What do I do?’ she pleaded. ‘There’s only one way out of this mess. When I was your age, I noticed that these people were extremely rich, extremely powerful and afraid of no one or thing. But then I noticed that there was a source of power greater than theirs and that when they came up against that power, they lost. That power source was Jesus Christ. So, I figured that I would rather side with the God that held the greater source of power. The name of Jesus Christ is the only one that is able to free you from what you’ve got yourself into. Right now, Satan is lord over your life. You need to ask Jesus Christ to be Lord. You need to pray to God and ask Him to undo every curse, hex and spell that you are subject to.’ ‘I want that! I want that right now!’ That afternoon, Samantha gave her heart to Jesus Christ and accepted a King James Bible. The last I heard, Samantha’s rebellious behaviour had quelled, and she was reading her Bible daily. Ideally , I would have recommende d some church for Samantha to attend, but by that stage, I could think of none. My mother originally moved to Bundaberg to be near her sisters. One sister, Beryl Jenkins, had lived in her beloved ‘Bundy’ the longest. My cousin David Mitchell rightly labelled Beryl ‘an evil bitch’ after holidaying with her as a child. When she wasn’t pretending to be a"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 142 Christian elder at the local Wesleyan Methodist Church, Aunty Beryl was heavily involved in her family’s true god – basketball. Beryl was particularly spiteful toward two members of the human race : me and my younger brother Peter. Perhaps this was because Peter and I naturally excelled at everything - including basketball. I joined a basketball team in Beryl’s Across the Waves club after shooting a three pointer over Will, Bundaberg’s star African American import, during a social game. I have never in my life witnessed anything as dir ty and dangerous as Bundaberg women’s basketball. The saddest moment came when a 15-year-old child on the opposing team broke her ankle. As the girl lay on the bitumen crying in agony, one of my teammates - the town’s only paediatrician - snarled, ‘Get her up!’ This same doctor ran the Bundaberg Rainbow Girls , a Freemasonic youth group for girls. At the end of my first basketball season, all of Bundaberg’s opposing clubs nominated me for the overall Association trophy. However, Aunty Beryl and my own club gave me nothing. Peter also won a trophy that season, but he was struck down with an illness and bedridden, weeks prior to presentation night. Consequently, Aunty Beryl stripped P eter’s name off the trophy and was about to give it to another child when the only club member with integrity intervened, chided them all, snatched the trophy and marched it to my mother’s house. But Aunty Beryl’s full capacity for evil manifested at her church which my family and I initially attended. Beryl’s daughter -in-law, Marcie , attended the same Wesleyan Methodist church. Marcie was my age and so we quickly became acquainted. She invited me to join the church youth group. When Marcie introduced a fellow youth group member who worked as a meter reader to me as being ‘like a spy for us,’ I realised she was consciously involved in a coven and had mistakenly assumed that I was too. It’ s a common assumption because Satanists can’t fathom the concept of escaping . Marcie warned me not to associate with a warm, pretty and musically talented youth group member named Lynette. ‘Why not?’ I puzzled. ‘She’s trouble,’ Marcie asserted. ‘She flirts with all the boys.’ ‘What do you mean? What boys?’ ‘It doesn’t matter,’ she rolled her eyes. ‘She’s just caused a lot of trouble.’ Aunty Beryl also warned me against associating with Lynette . Then Pastor Peter Breen’s daughter repeated derogative things that her mother , Mavis Breen, had uttered against Lynette. The whole church seemed to be gossiping about Lynette behind her back. Their comments were inconsistent with the modest sweet girl that I was observing ; so, I did what a Christian is supposed to do – I decided to talk with Lynette and make up my own mind about her. To everyone’s horror, I invited the social outcast to a big Christmas party at Aunty Beryl’s house, and I spent the entire evening getting to know Lynette. Eventually, I told Lynette bluntly what people had been saying to me about her , and I asked her what was going on. Lynette told me about an incident that had occurred when she was 1 6 years old. Her older sister Diane was about to be married but was killed in a car accident just south of Bundaberg, the week before her wedding. On the day of her wedding, the guests who had"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 143 travelled for the wedding attended her funeral instead. Her bri desmaids, dressed alike in their formal wedding-day dresses, stood by the bride’s coffin instead. During the chaotic week following her sister’s death, Lynette fell ill. So, her sister’s best friend, a nurse named Wendy, invited Lynette to stay at her house. Wendy’s husband, Adrian, was the son of a church deacon and a notorious philanderer. One morning, Wendy gave Lynette a large dose of codeine medication (Mersyndol) which le ft the child extremely drowsy and asleep in the spare bedroom. Soon after Wendy left for work, Adrian entered Lynette’s room, picked her up, carried her to his bed, and sexually assaulted her. I met with Lynette the day after her disclosure, placed some cr ayons and paper in front of her , and said, ‘Draw it for me. Show me what Adrian did to you.’ Lynette drew the assault. ‘Now,’ I continued, ‘draw a thought bubble above your head. Inside the thought bubble, write words that you were thinking.’ She wrote, NO ! ‘Did you tell your parents about this?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘What did they do?’ ‘They could have had him charged but that would have broken up the church.’ ‘So instead, everyone doesn’t know the truth, and someone started the rumour that you flirted with him.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And let me guess – your parents have been too preoccupied with your sister’s death to notice how you felt about being assaulted straight after your sister’s death?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And just how do you feel?’ ‘Like no-one would notice if I was gone.’ ‘Do you wish you were gone?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Have you thought about killing yourself?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Have you thought of how you’d do it?’ ‘Yes - overdose on pills ...’ I was myself young and inexperienced yet aware that the last time I kept silent about someone’s suicidal ideation they gassed themselves to death in Amsterdam. So, I had a go: ‘Lynette, this is a perfectly normal reaction to something bad that happened to you. Your sister was killed and while you were still in shock from that, and ill, and drugged, an adult sexually assaulted you. You were a child. None of this is your fault. You did nothing wrong.’ I paused. ‘I think you need to tell your parents about how you really feel. And I think someone needs to put a stop to all the church gossip.’ Lynette agreed. In fact, now she felt like standing up and telling the whole church. ‘How about we start with Pastor Breen? How would you feel about showing him these drawings?’ ‘Yes, I’d like that.’ ‘We could go right now if you like?’"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 144 ‘Yes.’ We went looking for the pastor at the church, but no-one was there. Then an idea dawned on me. I led Lynette into the empty church. ‘I’m going to sit in the pews,’ I suggested. ‘You stand at the front behind the pulpit. Pretend that the church is full. Tell the church what you would like them to know.’ Lynette addressed the invisible congregation and expressed what had been tearing her up inside since her sister’s death. Peter Breen arrived, and I told him, ‘Lynette has something to show you. Show him the drawings Lynette and tell him what you told me.’ Lynette showed the pastor her drawings, carefully explaining each one. Pastor: ‘I feel sick.’ ‘Did you know any of this?’ I asked him. ‘No, Lynette, I’m sorry, I didn’t realise.’ ‘Well ,’ I continued, ‘practically the whole church is gossiping about a wrong version of it, including my family and yours. Lynette here would like to get up in front of the whole congregation and tell everyone the truth. Instead, I think it’s only fair that you locate every single person who has been told the wrong story and tell them the truth. He nodded. ‘And please don’t tell Mavis [his wife] about this. It’ll ruin her Christmas.’ That evening, Lynette and I met with her parents and filled them in on recent events, including the malicious gossip. I prompted Lynette to express to her parents how she felt. ‘I want to commit suicide,’ Lynette announced. Her parents became still like stunned mullets. I softly asked Lynette’s Dad, ‘Where is your daughter right now? ‘Huh?’ ‘Where is Diane right now?’ He thought for a moment. ‘In heaven.’ ‘What do you think she thinks about that?’ ‘Well...she’d be very happy.’ ‘And what do you think God thinks of where she is right now?’ ‘Well, he would be pleased to have her there.’ ‘Okay, so your daughter’s in heaven, she is happy with that arrangement and so is God. God is sovereign, He loves us, but He decided to take her anyhow. I don’t know why God allows such horrible things to happen to us, I just know that we have to trust Him with the situation. While you have been grieving for your eldest daughter, you haven’t noticed that you’re about to lose your youngest.’ The full impact of my intervention with Lynette became apparent many months later. It all began one Sunday morning during church service. The pastor had introduced a new age doctrine to the church which involved having parishioners sit in a circle for service and inviting people to voice their opinion mid-service. One morning, the pastor gave a sermon on God’s image, and he asked people in the service to verbalise their impressions of God. Troy, a nice young man who had been a Christian for about a week, raised his hand and excitedly offered his opinion: ‘I-I-I think of the song, He’s got the whole world in His hands. I’m-I’m into body building, and that’s just my thing. So, I see God like a big Arnie Schwarzeneger holding up the world in his arms!’"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 145 The congregation applauded. Just then, a self-appointed church leader named Spencer Gere shot to his feet and pompously tore Troy’s opinion apart: ‘God is immaterial. He cannot be compared to mortal being, to some Hollywood actor ...’ As Spencer Gere raved on like a Shakespearean soliloquy, I turned to notice Troy behind me, deflating like a pool floaty. I arose and spoke, ‘The Bible clearly states that we are made in God’s image. We have arms – so does God. Troy may not have been a Christian for very long, he may not have been to Bible College and he may not have read a lot of books yet, but his understanding of God is just as valid. And now I’ll give you all something more important to focus on – someone in this congregation is involved in Satanism.’ The congregation applauded. Following the service, people approached me and stated: ‘Thanks for standing up for me ...’ ‘You said what we’ve all been thinking but didn’t have the guts to say ...’ ‘That guy has been putting us down for months.’ I was immediately summoned to an emergency meeting attended by Pastor Breen, Spencer Gere, Aunty Beryl, Lynette’s Dad (Kevin) and the pastor’s brother-in-law. Instead of opening the meeting in prayer, Spencer Gere launched into a criticism of me. Yet, every time he went to address me, I was overcome with a deep spiritual repulsion, as though an evil spirit was daring to converse - I promptly cut him off: ‘Don’t you dare speak to me!’ Pastor: ‘You can’t talk to Spencer like that!’ ‘He’s not a man of God!’ I snapped. Pastor: ‘What you are doing is not of God.’ ‘How would you know?’ ‘Because you’re causing division in the church!’ ‘Jesus said he came to separate the sheep from the goats.’ Pastor Breen was dumb. Aunty Beryl sat quietly with a smug look on her face. Tears welled in my eyes. Lynette’s father interjected: ‘No, no, no. This is all wrong. This is wrong. Fiona has done a lot to help our family. She saved our daughter’s life!’ But the wolf pack were not interested in words of reason, righteousness or support. Their criticism faded into background noise as I focussed on Lynette’s father: ‘Fiona, Fiona, ‘he implored. ‘Do you remember what you said to me?’ ‘No,’ I sobbed. ‘You told me three things that helped me get over my daughter’s death.’ He counted the list off his fingers. ‘Where is my daughter now, what does she think about that, and what does God think about that.’ ‘Thank you,’ I managed a small smile. Then I left. The following Sunday I began attending the local Baptist church which had two ministers. One of the ministers reminded me of a stout Roman Caesar, especially when, mid- sermon, he patted his fat gut and irreverently boasted, ‘And you all know how much I like my food.’ After my third Sunday of attendance, this pastor asked to meet with me. During this meeting he said that Pastor Breen had phoned him and warned him not to let me attend this church because I liked to ‘lure vulnerable young women into questionable counselling situations.’ Pastor Glutton concluded, ‘We do not want you to be a vessel through which the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 146 Holy Spirit works in this church.’ Months later, Pastor Glutton caused a split in the church and eventually started up a new church in Bargara with half of the congregation. At about this time, Aunty Beryl rallied Mum’s siblings plus my father into making a joint complaint to DOCS. Beryl al leged that my mother medically neglected my brother Peter who was not recovering from one of the numerous mystery illnesses that seemed to constantly plague Bundaberg in Biblical proportions. My mother had indeed sought medical attention. She had taken Peter to Bundaberg Base Hospital (notorious for Dr Patel’s killing spree) only to be told that there were no vacant beds and to go home and consult her GP in the morning. Mum took my brother back to his GP who wrote a medical certificate stating that there was nothing wrong with Peter. We later discovered that Peter had a rare virus that ate away the cartilage between two of his vertebrae and his hip. Peter’s GP was later struck of the medical registrar for multiple complaints of malpractice. My sister-in-law thrust Peter’s medical certificate in Aunty Beryl’s grimacing face while I asserted: ‘Oh you care so much about Peter’s illness. You cared so much that you ripped his name off his basketball trophy!’ Beryl screamed hysterically, ‘Have you spoken to James K raak yet? Well you should!’ and she left. James Kraak was the pastor of the new church that my mother and siblings had been attending called the People’s Church. At that stage , I was unaware that Kraak and his wife Helen had ritually abused my siblings at a church holiday camp held at Harvey Bay. I was aware that Kraak’s son had been suspended while under investigation for pedophilia at the remote primary school he taught at. In fact, I barely knew Pastor Kraak when I promptly drove to his house and said, ‘ Beryl told me that I should speak with you. Why?’ Kraak turned red and snapped, ‘She shouldn’t have!’ ‘What did you say to her?’ ‘I’m not telling you!’ One year, there was a knock at my front door. It was Lynette’s father Kevin - and P eter Breen. Pastor Breen began, ‘Spencer Gere wanted to come, but I didn’t think that would be a good idea.’ Me: ‘Correct.’ ‘We’ve had some experiences in the church which have led us to reconsider what you said about someone in the church being involved in Satanism.’ ‘What experiences?’ ‘One of the ladies was sewing and the sewing machine just picked itself off the table and smashed itself to pieces on the floor.’ Pastor Breen: ‘What can you tell us about Libby Margots?’ I snapped, ‘You went and told that other minister that I liked to lure vulnerable young women into questionable counselling situations! Did you ask Kevin here what he thought of that conclusion before making that phone call? You have more than one Satanist at your church, Peter. For starters there’s that warlock that you’ve placed on a pedestal and who is picking on new Christians! And what the hell are you doing attending secret prayer meetings with the local Catholic priest at the Catholic Church?! Your every move is dictated by a coven. Here you are asking about Libby when she manipulated you into ordering me not to speak with her again. What the hell was that?!’"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 147 Pastor Breen left the building. Later, sources told me that Peter Breen and his family had come under severe spiritual attack. One person who was dining with the Breens witnessed the whole family suddenly jump to their feet and rush into another room to pray. Pastor Breen left the ministry soon after, and his son Harley Breen whom my brothers befriended and was fond of, became a foul-mouthed comedian who joked about the hypocrisy of his father’s Bundaberg church. The Libby referred to was Aunty Beryl’s friend. Libby Margots strategically drained the church’s financial and human resources via counselling for her homosexual husband plus financial assistance for her six home -schooled children. Libby’s constant companion was a young woman who introduced herself to me as: ‘I’m Libby’s slave.’ Coven members call new initiates whom they are mentoring ‘slaves.’ My friend who regularly babysat for Libby (another Libby surnamed Fenner) told me about the goats and many other animals that Libby bred in large numbers, all of which would suddenly and mysteriously disappear. It was James Kraak who informed my mother that Libby was secretly in a relationship with a coven member named Robyn Brown. My family and I quickly caught on to Libby’s game – and she knew it. That’s why Libby ordered Pastor Breen to tell my mother and me to stay away from her. However, Libby couldn’t have felt as threatened as she made out. At a church luncheon she casually walked up to me and asked, ‘Fiona, I saw you at the hospital the other day. What were you doing there?’ ‘I was visiting Marcie.’ My cousin had recently suffered a miscarriage. ‘No, it wasn’t that. It was something else. What was it?’ I was volunteering at the hospital but had not told anyone about it. Such is the boldness that coven members exhibit when they seek information. Libby was connected with the owner of one of Bundaberg’s landmarks – the Purple Castle. This was a private dwelling which was built in the shape of a witches’ castle and painted in telltale purple. A bricklayer who laboured on the purple castle told my mother that he built a large round altar at its centre. The purple castle was owned and occupied by a woman who took in numerous young single mothers. Baby diapers constantly filled her clothesline. This was a blatant coven breeding centre. Bundaberg featured a large coven which comprised entirely of members with Scottish heritage. One member of this was a woman we called ‘the hat lady’ because she sold handmade hats at the local market. My family were thrice confronted by this hat lady, once at a highland dancing event, once at a market and most memorably in Bonnie Jean’s fabric shop. During the latter incident, I stood at a large table glancing through pattern catalogues. My mother and sister -in-law Janine stood on the other side, doing the same. My baby sister Emma wandered nearby. Suddenly we were surrounded by several people including the hat lady, a man in a full rainbow clown outfit and an obese, dark haired woman. I snapped to attention. ‘Don’t let them form a triangle around us!’ I ordered my family. ‘Get Emma away from that clown!’ My mother fetched Emma. The hat lady came and stood very close to my right and began turning the pages of a catalogue. The clown stood close to my left, pretending to"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 148 browse lingerie patterns. The fat lady stood at the counter, purchasing black and purple satin. I turned to the hat lady and affirmed, ‘I rebuke you in the nam e of the Lord Jesus Christ.’ The clown gasped, ran off to an obese woman who stood at the counter measuring yards of black and purple satin, and whispered something to her. The woman boasted aggressively, ‘She wouldn’t dare say that to me!’ Yes, I would. The hat lady thrust her gargoyle face in mine and hissed, ‘Who do you think you are?’ I looked her dead in the eye and affirmed: ‘I -will-be -your- downfall .’ The hat lady flew into a rage, knocked me out of her way and snatched my catalogue. She slammed the book down on the table and began thumbing through the pages. ‘Rachel!’ she shrieked. A thin, young store assistant nervously approached the table. ‘Rachel! Did you hear what this lady said? She rebuked me in Jesus’ name!’ Rachel’s eyes darted about ner vously as she scanned my family for clues as to what she should do. ‘We’re just looking at patterns,’ my mother shrugged. I gave Rachel a look of ‘who’s the crazy’ while twirling my finger around my ear. ‘Well?!’ the hat wench demanded: ‘What are you going to do about it?!’ Rachel stammered, ‘I-I-I don’t know what to do.’ The coven members congregated at the counter while my family and I stood in a small circle and began to pray aloud. Then the group disbanded and returned to normal behaviour, completely ignoring the fact that a group of people were praying aloud in the middle of a fabric shop. I encountered another Scottish identity while participat ing in a local production of the musical Les Miserables . John Harbison was an optometrist whose friendship seemed harmless until he began criticising my absent English boyfriend, and saying, ‘He only thinks he loves you, but he doesn’t.’ I agreed to accompany John Harbison to a restaurant for dinner. Afterwards, we went back to his house for tea. We sat on the back deck of his Queenslander home, glancing through art books. I commented on one of the artworks when suddenly, coffee in hand, John Harbison leaned forward, stared at my eyes and declared: ‘Beezlebub, Lord of the Flies!’ ‘Huh?’ I shot him a puzzled look. ‘Beezlebub lord of the flies?! What does that have to do with the price of fish?’ Harbison frantically scanned my face for signs of an impending expected reactio n – but it wasn’t forthcoming. He had uttered a trigger phrase, not realising that because I had processed the ritual abuse incidents, the trigger was deactivated. That was Harbison’s first blunder. His second mistake came after I told him I was visiting England. What I had failed to tell him was that I would only be in England a few short months before travelling to Western Australia. I was interstate when my mother received a letter that John Harbison addressed to me. In his letter he stated that he was in a Scottish pub and had scoured the UK searching for me. ‘WHERE ARE YOU?!’ he screamed in writing that consumed half a page. ‘But he knew where you were,’ my mother deduced. ‘You told him you were in England. Why would he think anything else?’"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 149 John’s le tter ended with a one page of list of grotesque and seemingly unrelated words including ‘vomit’ and ‘rhinoceros’ that resembled a curse. The next time I spied John Harbison was during the early hours of the morning, under a full moon. My mother and I recognised him with three men standing together in the next- door driveway. They were dressed in brown robes and pointed hats. The men stood out the front of 46 George St, near the front unit occupied by a South African man named Tony and his four -year-old-son. The little boy often entered our house uninvited and started talking to us. One day we caught him perfectly forming his hands into a satanic sign. We asked him what the sign meant. The child answered and then proceeded to talk us through and demonstra te his enormous repertoire of satanic hand signals. On another day, the little boy walked into Mum’s bedroom, eating an ice block. When he finished, he showed my mother the stick and asked, ‘What does that say?’ ‘Heaven,’ Mum read. ‘Do you know where that is?’ he pointed to the ground. ‘Down there.’ ‘Oh, no it isn’t. That’s where Satan lives.’ Mum pointed to the sky. ‘Heaven is up there. God lives up there.’ The boy then pointed at my brother Peter and blurted, ‘We shot Peter last night!’ The previous ni ght, Peter awoke screaming in agony and saying he felt something like electricity shoot up his arm. That was the last time we saw the little boy. He and his father suddenly disappeared. A while later we spied a cleaning lady at their rented unit. Under the guise of being a potential tenant, my sister -in-law Janine approached the cleaner and inquired about the unit. The cleaning lady began complaining about the job. She described a strange brownish substance that was stuck to the bathroom floor and walls, an d she invited Janine in to look. Janine returned to us looking a shade paler. ‘It’s everywhere! There’s a great pool of it all over the floor, and it’s splattered all over the walls and ceiling. It looks like someone was butchered in there!’ Following this incident, Bundaberg Centrelink social security office sent my mother a letter informing her that my brother Peter was dead. Then Mum found a little white note that a postal worker had taped to the inside of her Australia Post box which read, ‘Watch mail coming into this box.’ Then we found dried, dead chopped up animals scattered all over our front footpath. Then, on several occasions, taxis continually circled our block and drove past our house from midnight until 3am. During our final year in Bundaberg, one of my brother’s began dating his classmate Anne Gillespie. Anne was of Scottish heritage and she lived in a Bargara house that was passed from coven family to coven family. Anne showed me a satanic altar that was erected in her back yard. She told my family that babies had been sacrificed in her home and that there was an enormous blood stain on the wooden floor of her upstairs bedroom, beneath the carpet. My brother clearly recalls a time that Anne’s parents drugged him and Anne during a party attended by local coven members. Anne was 17 years old when she told my mother that she was frightened of her parents and she begged my mother to help her escape Bundaberg. When my husband and I left Bundaberg, we gave Anne a ride. As soon as we were gone, police Sergeant Greg Maloney"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" 150 phoned my mother’s house and hissed to my eight year old brother Michael: ‘Your mother has thirty minutes to tell me where Anne is or else I’ll come and get you all in my squad car!’ This was the same Sergeant who bullied a 16-year-old girl out of pursuing legal recourse for being gang raped by 10 young Bundaberg men. The girl assumed that her boyfriend was dropping her at work when he drove her to a warehouse where the perpetrators awaited. These men are now all prominent Bundaberg businessmen. The men proceeded to rape the girl all day and night. The girl attended Bundaberg hospital which reported the rape to local police. Sergeant Greg Maloney subsequently interrogated the girl severely, including verbally abusing and accusing her in a manner inconsistent with police policy and procedures. When the girl broke down under this pressure, Sergeant Maloney concluded she would not withstand cross-examination, and so he dropped the matter . My mother returned Sergeant Maloney’s call and informed him that Anne had already town left with me. Sergeant Maloney threatened, ‘We have the power to block every single road in the state, and we’ll do it! We’ll find them!’ They didn’t find us. Later, I lodged complaints regarding the sergeant with seve ral bodies including the CJC (criminal justice commission) which was supposedly independent. The young woman from the anti-corruption commission whom I spoke with immediately contacted the Bundaberg’s Sergeant Maloney and informed him of my complaint. I correctly anticipated this and confronted her on the phone: ‘You just called Bundaberg – didn’t you!’ ‘I-ah-er...’ ‘Yeah, I know exactly how you lot work.’ Anne’s parents placed a mental health warrant out for her despite no history or symptoms of mental illness. In an attempt to secure Anne’s rights, I consulted legal aid, paid a lawyer and studied relevant legislation. The police recorded an interview with Anne at my home. During this, Anne told the police all about the murders and child abuse that she had witnessed in her home. Anne repeated this information to the Department of Children’s Services (DOCS). In response, DOCS demanded an interview with my mother. DOCS acted more interested in what my mother might have said to influence Anne, rather than Anne’s allegations against her parents of involvement in child abuse and murder. When DOCS interviewed me, the first thing they asked was whether my brother, who was slightly older than Anne, was in a sexual relationship with his girlfriend. ‘No,’ I responded. ‘So, you’re more interested in pinning a statutory rape case on my brother rather than investigating Anne’s testimony of child abuse and murder in her parents’ home?’ Despite their best efforts, DOCS found nothing against my family – because there was nothing to find. Anne moved interstate with my family where she enrolled in her final year of high school. When she turned 18 years old, she left us to meet her former best friend from Bundaberg at a nearby hotel. We never saw Anne Gillespie again. * * * "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 151 An Offer I Could Refuse I completed my psychology undergraduate degree two weeks before the birth of my first child. My eldest baby was 18 months old when I underwent a rigorous selection process for becoming a parole officer. I was placed on a waitlist for a position in my local NSW area. Meanwhile, I was advised to take a casual position with an interstate parole office which was suddenly desperate for applicants. I took a casual position at Burleigh Heads. Most Queensland parole officer positions were casual. I met one employee who had been casual for 11 years and could not get a house loan because his job was not permanent. At Burleigh, I unwittingly entered an industrial nightmare , ‘the systematic destruction of a fully functioning office ,’ as Robyn Farris described it. Regional Manager Rod had seconded Burleigh Heads boss of 20 years, John, against his will to Beenleigh office located 100km north of his workplace and home. Rod then gave the freshly vacated managerial position to his friend Catherine Hand who held no parole officer experience or relevant tertiary qualifications. Catherine had a visual arts diploma from the Que ensland College of Art where I obtained my first degree. Upon assuming the management position, Catherine bullied out the experienced officers who had worked harmoniously together at Burleigh for 14 years. Catherine replaced these with young, inexperienced females, including dumb blonde looking me. I excelled at the job tasks and thoroughly enjoyed working with offenders. I had a knack for court report writing, understanding legislation, and court work. My first court performance was the talk of the office, and my fast brain coped easily with a caseload of 100 offenders. It was the office politics that concerned me. For three months I quietly observed Catherine Hand bully the experienced staff, place them under excessive scrutiny, label them ‘dead wood,’ and slash their caseloads. On one occasion, Catherine pinned an outstanding teenage parole officer named Chris to the wall, placed her fat red lips inches from his face, and screamed at the top of her voice in front of reporting offenders: ‘YOU’RE A FUCKING IDIOT!’ The Federal Police subsequently snatched Chris up for employment. Catherine Hand’s offer was announced one Friday afternoon following a training conference at Tugun Life Saving Club. I found myself sitting alone with at a café table with Catherine who fiddled with the ring on her finger. It was gold and bore an Order of the Easter Star encircled pentagram. The pentagram centre contained a black stone, while each point featured a different coloured gemstone: blue, green, red, white and yellow. ‘Fiona, have you seen my ring?’ Catherine asked. ‘No,’ I lied. ‘This is my coven ring. Each gemstone represents one of the women in our coven. I’m the diamond. This one is Megan [a Queensland College of Art pottery teacher]. Every two years, no matter where we are in the world, the five of us meet up. Fiona, if you play your cards right, you’ll go far in management.’ I eyeballed Catherine and sternly affirmed: ‘I’ m not management material.’ The following Monday, I submitted detailed complaint against Catherine Hand’s bullying behaviour to upper management. Upon discovering this, Catherine called me into her office where Southport Area Manager Peter Smales sat smirking. Catherine Hand pinned me against the wall like a white -collared psychopath and shoved her face in mine . She smiled like a Cheshire cat and spat, ‘You have ten minutes to vacate your office!’"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 152 The Corrective Services Regional Manager subsequently sent me a letter which notified me I had been temporarily filling in for some woman named Helen who had been on maternity leave (news to me) and that I was being let go. Rod stipulated in writing that I had done ‘nothing wrong.’ Three Burleigh parole officers and I lodged successful WorkCover c ompensation claims against Catherine Hand. The Industrial Relations commissioner also upheld my complaint against Catherine, openly called her a bully during the first round of hearings. With disgust he declined Catherine Hand’s ridiculous settlement offer and he decided for me that I would be pursuing the matter further. Yet I decided to leave Catherine behind me and concentrate on my new job offer, because I am not that litigious. However, Catherine Hand pursued me , with the full blessing of the Queensland Department of Corrective Services. Catherine Hand used government expenditure to hire a private detective who sat in a car outside my house photographing me. Then she went through my resume and phoned previous employers looking for dirt on me. Then she phoned my next two bosses and told them to get rid of me. Finally, I hired a barrister who phoned the Queensland Department of Corrective Service State Manager and requested the Department cease harassing me. State Manager: ‘We can do whatever the fuck we like!’ My barrister: ‘No you fucking can’t !’ Meanwhile, the Department hired a professional mediator to investigate and mediate Burleigh Heads office. The man interviewed each employee separately and then coordinated a group confrontation where the office had the opportunity to vent their experiences. Catherine Hand subsequently broke down crying and apologised to young Chris who told me, ‘I almost felt sorry for her.’ I was not invited to that healing opportunity, which is a shame because that is the point at which I developed noticeable PTSD symptoms (separate from those attached to my child abuse flashbacks). This bullying experience marked a permanent personality change. Catherine Hand and her co-conspirators were subsequently promoted, and the Burleigh office was eventually cleared of all its ‘dead wood.’ A decade later , the bullied senior staff vouched for my character to Gavan Palk who supervised my psychology registration. I reeled in horror the day Gavan informed me he was the Corrective Services boss who first hired Catherine Hand. ‘YOU hired her?!’ ‘I know,’ he lamented. ‘I’m sorry, I had no idea.’ * * *"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 153 Conspiracy Fact Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness. - George Orwell 9/11 In October 2002, I was in New York City, peering out a massive window of the World Finance Centre at the construction scene below.

One graduate described the program as follows: This place is like the temple where leaders of law enforcement come to receive their mission - don’t ever lose the magic . 97 Jim Berger (21 May 2012).

Tony Lauer, who became Commissioner in 1991, resigned prematurely in 1996 due to the Wood Royal Commission into NSW police corruption. Lauer succeeded Commissioner John Avery (my perpetrator). Lauer previously trained with the Australian Army at Holsworthy in 1957 and headed the Freemason Grand Lodg e of NSW and ACT. Commissioner Lauer attended the FBI Academy just when the FBI instigated an infiltration program code-named PATCON (short for ‘Patriot Conspiracy’). ‘Patriot’ loosely defines antigovernment, racist, antisemitic, and/or Christian ‘extremists.’ PATCON officially ran from 1991-93 and consisted of FBI undercover agent provocateurs posing as members of a fictional extremist group, to infiltrate target Patriot groups and gather intelligence related to past, present, or future crimes . The 1991 prosecution goals included: conspiracy to commit murder, illegal possession of weapons, and money laundering. Yet no criminal convictions resulted. Instead, PATCON proved to be a training exercise for Ruby Ridge, Waco, Oklahoma, 9/11, and Australia’s Port Arthur. The operation also provided preparation for the myriad of anti-terror laws introduced to Australia post-9/11, and the subsequent establishment of ‘Fixated Persons’ police-psychiatric detainment facilities in Australia and the UK. Social Media Psychological Operations Social media is a psychological war zone. The secret services, military, Vatican, cults, and various police organisations employ thousands upon thousands of social media agents. The role of these agents is to monitor, identify, target, and infiltrate individuals and activist groups opposed to the Luciferian global agenda. Social media agents target those who speak out against such controversial issues as the global child sex trafficking operation, 5G, vaccination, immigration, and the ‘Safe Schools’ program. After six years of battling it out on the internet, the agents’ behavioural patterns have become obvious to me, and I conclude that approximately 90 percent of the higher profile alternative media identities are in f act agents, paid to control the narrative regarding controversial topics, with the primary goal of swaying public opinion and subduing the masses from revolting. These agents employ Hegelian Dialectic methods and pretend to argue a topic, when in fact they are all working toward the same goal. They muddy the waters with endless rhetoric until the public is confused and are dissuaded from investigating the truth of a matter. The following three news articles provide insight to this type of psychological operation. The authorities typically claim the ir operation is to target extremists - when in practise they target government dissidents - and they throw in the obligatory terms ‘Russia’ and ‘Isis’ as if this justifies the ir operation.

The senior Twitter executive with editorial responsibility for the Middle East is also a part-time officer in the British Army’s psychological warfare unit, Middle East Eye has established. Gordon MacMillan, who joined the social media company's UK office six year s ago, has for several years also served with the 77th Brigade, a unit formed in 2015 in order to develop ‘non-lethal’ ways of waging war. The 77th Brigade uses social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, as well as podcasts, data analysis and audience research to wage what the head of the UK military, General Nick Carter, describes as “information warfare”. Carter says the 77th Brigade is giving the British military ‘the capability to compete in the war of narratives at the tactical le vel’; to shape perceptions of conflict. Some soldiers who have served with the unit say they have been engaged in operations intended to change the behaviour of target audiences. What exactly MacMillan is doing with the unit is difficult to determine, how ever: he has declined to answer any questions about his role, as has Twitter and the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD)... While clearly engaged in propaganda , the MoD is reluctant to use that word to describe the unit’s operations. His involvement with the 77th Brigade was made public when he disclosed it on his page at LinkedIn, the online professional networking site. As well as outlining his responsibilities at Twitter, MacMillan wrote that he had an interest in politics and international affairs, had trained at Sandhurst, the British military academy, ‘and am a reserve officer in the British Army serving in 77th Brigade, which specialises in non -lethal engagemen’. His page has recently been edited to remove all references to his service with 77th Brigade. * * * Fixated Persons Victims of government child trafficking who seek justice are being labelled ‘Fixated Persons ’ and finding themselves targeted for detainment. NSW, Queensland, and Victoria recently constructed Fixated Threat Assessment Centres (FTAC) which are attached to Australian state police forces. These Orwellian facilities are staffed by specialist police, forensic psychiatrists, forensic psychologists, and Special Intelligence Officers (SOI). Detainees are referred to FTACs by ‘family, neighbours, counter -terrorism authorities, or local police’ and held for 14 days without legal representation or family knowledge. The FTACs detain people for crimes they may commit in the future, 98 thereby violating a fundamental tenet of Western law which determines citizens are innocent until proven 98 Patrick Wright (2018).

The perpetrators circumvent this law by never formally charging the detained citizen with a crime. Holding an individual for mental health or terror reasons is apparently legal. As in Nazi Germany, laws are not broken, merely adjusted to accommodate an underlying agenda. The people behind this Totalitarian regime define ‘Fixated Persons’ as: - Victims of crime, - Typically aggrieved at being wrongly done by, - Seeking justice, - Litigious and chronic complainers, - Exposing government corruption or treason, - Posting too much on social media about government officials and other public identities, - Making too many FOI (freedom of i nformation) and document requests, - Repeatedly lodging complaints to politicians or local council, - Having strong religious beliefs or ideology. The above definition is broad and vague. It fails to specify what constitutes ‘too much’ of a particular action or ‘too strong’ a belief. The concept of ‘Fixated Person’ has not been legally formalised but left for government agents to interpret, adapt, arbitrarily apply to whatever target they choose. As such, the above definition can be loosely interpreted to describe victims of government child trafficking who speak publicly about, and actively seek justice and redress for, the heinous crimes committed a gainst us. The definition is being misused to profile victims and whistle -blowers like me. The British-based trafficking network’s primary objective is to discredit victims of their global child trafficking operation. Their agents achieve this by labelling targets psychotic, criminal or even better – criminally insane . Their traditional modus operandi was to lure targets into a ‘health assessment’ where dirty doctors labelled them non-compliant psychotics (as when Bond University psychology and criminology lecturers conspired with dirty NSW and Queensland cops in their failed attempt to frame me). This method is now superseded by a formalised kidnapping and detainment operation in three Australian states. FTACs promise to re -victimise child trafficking survivors via the same abuse methods the CIA perpetrators originally used on us. The expressed purpose of Australia’s anti-terror laws introduced by Freemason and Satanist John Howard in 2002 was to stop Islamic terrorism. Instead, the laws are being used against citizens seeking to expose political party corruption. Let us examine who has been genuinely targeted by these FTAS teams: - Phil Galea was kidnapped by Victorian police in August 2016, falsely charged under anti-terror laws, and is still detained in solitary confinement without trial. Politicians and police are preventing Phil from appearing before a judge and jury, which would expose the ‘ Fixated Persons’ wrought."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 158 - Fiona Wilson , a former Origin Energy executive, was involuntarily detained and injected with drugs in the Brisbane FTAC for blowing the whistle on the coal-seam gas industry. Wilson was left with PSTD. - A grandmother who complained to authorities that her 12-year-old granddaughter was being raped and sex trafficked by her father was declared a ‘Fixated Person’ by a judge who referred her to the FTAC where she was placed under perpetual surveillance and her passport stamped to prevent her leaving Australia. Australia’s Family Courts, child social services (renamed DOCS, FACS, etc) and foster care system have facilitated government child trafficking since their inception. The same occurs in the UK and USA. Every day for five years, desperate parents contacted me and shared the same story: the government fabricated grounds to steal, prostitute, disappear, kill their kids. The FTACs make the Australian leg of the global child trafficking operation far easier and simpler to implement and maintain. Some advice: if you discover your child is being sexually abused by your partner – take the child and disappear. Some mothers have had success by inducing the husband to physically assault them and using their resultant injuries as evidence for a domestic violence order and fleeing with the child. If Child Protective Services start sniffing around your family – run! Leave at the first hint. Forfeit all material goods, pack your kids, a loaned car, documents, cash, and some clothes, and just disappear. Tell no-one where you go. Find fake IDs and wait it out in some remote location until the kids are grown. Australia’s foster care system is a massive child sex trafficking operation. It is concerning that neighbours can refer victims to the FTAC, considering a common tactic is to have agents move in next door to victims and threaten and harass them. It is also concerning when the Centres are staffed by perpetrators. Further, Queensland’s Fixated Threat Assessment Centre is staffed by clinicians from the Queensland Forensic Mental Health Service, who employ Bond University forensic psychologists. Secret Intelligence Operatives (SIO) The FTACs plant police informants called Secret Intelligence Operatives (SIO) to entrap victims for detainment in their tax-funded MK -ULTRA facilities. SOI agents employ the following methods: - Pretend to be right-wing extremists. - Stage and film fake arrests for fake terror breaches. - Befriend and physically access targets. - Set the target up for arrest for associating with ‘terrorists’ and engaging in ‘terror activities.’ Their modus operandi was demonstrated in a 2008 Melbourne case where a police agent called ‘SIO 39’ was cross examined regarding his entrapment of an Islamic terrorist"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 159 cell. 99 SIO 39 ‘told the court he was a Victoria Police officer working undercover with the covert unit of the security intelligence group.’ The SIO agent inserted himself into a terror cell where he taught the leader how to make a bomb. The prosecution asked SIO 39: ‘You were making a very deliberate effort to befriend him, weren't you? ... Consistent with the directions you had been given?’ ‘Yes, that's right,’ said the agent. The FTAC’s entrapment methods are classic PATCON tactics where agent provocateurs lure victims into engaging in behaviour which constitutes a breach of legislation and subjects them to search and seizure laws. In 2018, I was simultaneously targeted by six agents connected to Fixated Threat Assessment Centres in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. They were notably connected to NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller who held locational jurisdiction. All secret intelligence type agents base grooming conversation on real life events, to appear more convincing. Hence one SOI agent told me he trafficked drugs in Sydney for the Australian Federal Police. The agents tried to trick me into breaching Australia’s strict anti-terror laws and provide justification for police to raid my property and arrest me. Their entrapment methods included unsuccessfully encouraging me to: - Hand them administrative control of my websites and social media pages, under the guise of improving my sites. - Become a board member and so assume legal responsibility for an agent-created and controlled child abuse advocacy group. - Excessively post about certain politicians on social media. - Publicly incite social discord by joining the agent s’ call for an ‘uprising.’ - Endorse vigilante behaviour including t-shirts labelled ‘Pedo Hunters’ which were decorated with images of a hangman noose / gun sight target. - Provide a list of known perpetrators to be targeted for vigilante style justice (i.e., premeditated murder ). - Physically associate with agent provocateurs posing as extreme right terrorists. - Accept money and trafficked commodities from ‘terrorists’ and ‘terror activities.’ - Accept unregistered guns under the guise of protecting myself from the pedophile network. - Provide a list of all fellow government trafficking victims I knew, including their locations and testimonies, under the guise of making a documentary. Having studied Australian anti-terror legislation and statutory interpretation, I quickly recognised how and why the above activities list might be interpreted as breaching our vague counter -terrorism laws. Associating with known terrorists, wearing uniform outfits, accepting money from terrorists, possessing illegal weapons, and conspiring to commit murder - constitute grounds for immediate arrest and detainment. 99 Karen Kissane (2008).

Here are some of Mullen’s secret service career highlights: - Worked with MK -ULTRA Subproject 84 hypnosis doctors including Peter W. Sheehan. - Court-appointed expert in the MK -ULTRA Chelmsford Hospital medical negligence case. - First non-military defence expert to enter the Guantanamo Bay detention centre, site of Seligman’s CIA torture program. - Heads the Fixated Person Research Groups linked to MI6, FBI, and Tavistock (UK’s mind control hub). - Contracted by the British Royal Family. - Interviewed Melbourne Hoddle Street shooter, Julian Knight. - Assessed alleged Port Arthur shooter, Martin Bryant. - Publicly presented the Christchurch NZ massacre script and shooter profile two weeks before the event. - Supports false memory writings of CIA psychologist Elizabeth Loftus. The book Dope Inc . (1978) was meticulously researched and proved beyond all doubt that the British Royal Family are the ultimate benefactors of the CIA coordinated, global drug trafficking operation. The royals are also the financial benefactors of the global child sex trafficking operation. Prince Andrew was accused of raping minors trafficked by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. One of Prince Andrew’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, had her photo taken with him. Recall the Royal Family were caught on film teaching princesses Elizabeth and Margaret to Nazi salute. Recall pop star Mick Jagger referred to Queen Elizabeth as ‘Chief Witch.’ 100 I witnessed the queen preside over the ritual murder of 11 kids at St James Anglican Church in Sydney City when I was 1 1 years old. Port Arthur: Paul Mullen was the court-appointed psychiatrist who assessed Martin Bryant, the young man forced to change his plea to guilty and so receive 35 life sentences for the Port Arthur massacre. After a 3.5-hour interview, Mullen claimed Martin Bryant possessed an IQ of 60. It is neurologically impossible for someone whose intelligence level sits at the bottom 2% of the population to kill 19 people in 20 seconds. That head shot rate is not achievable by the world’s most elite snipers, whose intelligence level must sit in the top 1% of the population because high visual-spatial IQ is essential for accurate shooting ability. Christchurch Shooting: Paul Mullen ‘coincidentally’ popped up at four mass shootings in Australia and New Zealand. He was working in Melbourne in 1987 where he interviewed the Hoddle Street shooter, Julian Knight. Then he moved to Aramoana in New Zealand in time for David Gray’s 1990 shooting massacre. Then he returned to Melbourne in time for the Tasmanian Government to request he interview Mar tin Bryant in 1996. And he just happened to be visiting New Zealand for the 2019 mass shooting in Christchurch. Two weeks prior to the Christchurch massacre, Mullens spoke at Melbourne’s Sofitel hotel where he released an 100 The Telegraph (2012).

False Memory Fan: Paul Mullen’s research interests include: Litigious and Chronic Complainers , and the Long -Term Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse - the ideal combination for silencing outspoken victims of CIA child trafficking. Paul Mullen was quoted in a 1994 False Memory Syndrome Foundation newsletter as saying: 101 The precedence accorded child sexual abuse has also had negative consequences , socially and scientifically, particularly in distracting attention away from physical and emotional abuse and from the whole context of disadvantage and neglect in which the sexual abuse often occurs. Not surprisingly, Paul Mullen is a child abuse denier and an advocate of Elizabeth Loftus’ discredited false memory opinion. Mullen claimed, ‘ the basis of the recovered-memory theory was flawed ... there were no specific symptoms that came from childhood abuse .’ 102 In his book Childhood Sexual Abuse : An Evidence -Based Perspective, 103 Mullen denies the phenomenon of repressed trauma memories being stored in the right implicit brain and accessible via appropriate therapy: On the other side of the debate have been equally powerful defences of the capacit y of therapists to bring to consciousness repressed memories that on occasion, it is asserted, provide detailed and veridical narratives of actual abuse... However, contrary to these claims, the main problem following trauma is an inability to forget rather than a complete loss of the memory of the event... Psychogenic amnesia following trauma may occur, but usually the individuals are well-aware of the gap in their memory. There are claims that memories of CSA are laid down in the brain through a unique proce ss that does not apply to other forms of trauma and that can be recovered via the sensorimotor system... This remains an unproven hypothesis... Current theories of memory emphasize that memories are not replicas of the events themselves but imperfect and subjectively modified records of how we have experienced those events... That it is possible to influence the memories of others by suggestion is established ( Loftus , 1993) . . . Both client and therapist may believe they are overcoming the forces of repression and revealing the true narrative of the abuse, but how much the expectations, assumptions, and theoretical commitments of both participants are producing a new construction remains in question. 101 FMS Foundation Newsletter (2004).

I experienced this in 1993 when I visited Sutherland Hospital. There is no record of my ever having been admitted or treated at Sutherland Hospital. My parents never took me there during my Sydney childhood. Yet I knew the layout of an internal ER room at Sutherland Hospital. I visited the hospital at age 23 in search of the room I awoke in after suffocating in a grave at age eight years. A triage nurse kindly led me to a room out of public bounds which looked exactly as I remembered and drew it. The walls were clad in pale blue tiles, the door and furniture were positioned exactly like in my therapy drawing, and the original oxygen bottle sat at the head of the very stainless-steel table I was laid on. ‘This is where you would have come if you had suffocated,’ the nurse told me. Dirty Doctors Corydon Hammond said in his legendary Greenbaum Speech : When you start to find the same highly esote ric information in different states and different countries, from Florida to California, you start to get an idea that there’s something going on that is very large, very well coordinated, with a great deal of communication and systematic -ness to what’s happening. So, I have gone from someone kind of neutral and not knowing what to think about it all, to someone who clearly believes ritual abuse is real, and that the people who say it isn’t are either naive like people who didn’t want to believe the Holocaust - or they’re dirty . Paul Mullen, who denies the true nature of child abuse induced trauma, who embraces the pro-pedophile writings of discredited Elizabeth Loftus, who hangs around CIA MK-ULTRA torture and mind control facilities, who leaps the Tasman sea in time for every Australasian mass shooting, and who, despite being a ‘world renown expert’ excluded irrefutable evidence that it was neurologically impossible for a mentally disabled man with an IQ of 60 to have committed the crime (thereby condemning an innocent man to life in prison) - is the main driving force behind new Orwellian legislation and protocols which are being used to effectively target and silence vocal victims and witnesses to government organised child sex trafficking. * * * "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 163 Justice Denied No one calls for justice; no one pleads a case with integrity. They rely on empty arguments, they utter lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil. (Isaiah 59:4) ‘Andersonian’ Legacy We stand at the precipice of Aldous Huxley’s promised Final Revolution. Australian law prevents freedom of speech, permits whistleblowers to be charged with defamation, and allows outspoken victims of CIA child trafficking to be labelled ‘terrorists’ and subsequently seized, detained and subjected to the same abuse we experienced as children by the same perpetrator network. Ero sion of Australia’s civil liberties and Judeo-Christian culture traces back to the University of Sydney Philosophy lecturer John Anderson who (from 1927 to 1958) applied Cultural Marxism to create an enduring legacy of indoctrination which influenced future generations of politicians, journalists, and law reformers. John Anderson taught my key perpetrators, three of whom were discovered to be Soviet spies and seemingly assassinated by the British Crown. Cultural Marxism is a non -violent but revolutionary collectivist ideology that seeks the gradual gain of power via infiltration and the modification of laws, institutions and social organisations. Western educational institutions, particularly government schools and universities, are a hub of left-brain Cultural Marxist indoctrination. Communism dominates Australia’s education system thanks to Soviet spy Alfred Conlon who created a system of standardisation and control via the Commonwealth Education Department. I encountered militant pro-Marxist teaching in six universities, in three states, over a 30-year span. I know from experience that Marxist teachings saturate the fields of Education, Science, Psychology, Law, Philosophy, and the Visual A rts. I attended the top Art Colleges in three Australian states and found them all intolerant of independent creative thinking. Australian educators saturate developing brains with Luciferian Marxist culture - sexual promiscuity, globalisation, lawlessness, anti -nationalism, occultism, pro-abortion, pro- pedophilia, and a mocking hatred of the Biblical God. John Anderson founded Australian Realism, the Empirical brand of philosophy which spread to the University of Adelaide and Alfred Conlon’s brainchild, the Australian National University. All three universities became infiltrated with Anderson’s Communist legacy . All three became MK -ULTRA research facilities. Anderson was aligned with the Trotsky movement and the Communist Party of Australia (renamed The Australian Greens ) and he contributed to their journals. Anderson pushed the Marxist agenda including sexual revolution and abolition of religion in schools. He argued that God does not exist, traditional Christian concepts of good and evil were only meant for slaves, and the notion of morality is empty. His converts (labelled ‘Andersonians’ ) included members of the Sydney Push , a leftist intellectual subculture who rejected conventional morality and placed Sydney at the forefront of the sexual revolution. Promiscuous feminist Germaine Greer is a fine example . "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 164 ALP Law Reform My ears pricked up when our law lecturer said the Australian Labor Party (ALP) were the first political group to appoint Catholic judges in our predominantly Protestant country. The ALP also appointed the two reformers most cited in Australian law schools, Lionel Murphy (my pedophile rapist) and Michael Kirby (publicly accused of pedophilia by Senator Bill Heffernan). Catholic Murphy attended Sydney Boys High selective school and commenced at the University of Sydney in 1949. Murphy was nominated as Chief Justice by Gough Whitlam (my pedophile rapist) and appointed by John Kerr (my pedophile rapist). Known for his radicalism and judicial activism, Murphy’s reforms included establishing the Law Reform Commission, and no-fault divorce which led to an epidemic of broken homes and displaced youth ripe for recruitment into child trafficking and Luciferian cults. Murphy notably authorised the 1973 raids on ASIO. Corruption allegations plagued Lionel Murphy until his death, after his 1985 conviction for perverting the course of justice. Michael Kirby is a Fort Street Boys High graduate who commenced law at the University of Sydney in 1959. Kirby served as Vice Chancellor of Macquarie University, plus as an executive with CSIRO and the Law Reform Commission. Kirby was nominated Chief Justice by ALP Prime Minister Paul Keating (whose rape and murder of a young boy I witnessed). In 2002, Senator Heffernan used Parliamentary privilege to announce , Michael Kirby used a government car to solicit underage male prostitutes at the Army Barracks ‘Wall’ in Darlinghurst, which victims confirmed to me. In response, Kirby announced he was gay, and leftist politicians and journalists accused Bill Heffernan of ‘homophobi a.’ The truth of the matter remains sealed in the Wood Royal Commission case files. Why Study Philosophy Philosophy is the study of how people think. An introductory knowledge of philosophy is crucial for understanding the origins of the eugenics program we know as MK -ULTRA, and the perpetrator mind-set. Let us quickly review the historical erosion of traditional values and insertion of Marxist doctrine via a subject every Australian law student undertakes, Philosophy and the Law . Here is my essay in that subject, which addressed the question of whether a relationship still exists between justice and the law. My essay provides an extremely simple introduction to Philosophy and its relationship to legislative and social change. Justice Defined The first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary 104 defined justice as a quality or principle meaning morality, equity, righteousness, truth, integrity, and restitution. By contrast, the modern law student’s prescribed legal dictionary considers justice, A concept defined according to the particular philosophical school of the inquirer . 105 Western concepts of justice combine Greco-Roman philosophical traditions with Scripture. 106 From Plato to postmodernists, philosophers have debated the existence of a relationship between law and justice. The resultant theories are generally divided into two 104 Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford University Press, 1928). 105 R. Finkelstein & D.

The opposing camp considers justice to be human-made and evolving with society’s changing mores. 108 Their theories are soaked in Darwinist eugenics, ethical re lativism, secular humanism, and collectivism, which successively distorted the interpretation of the word ‘justice’ until it lost its original meaning. Justice went from a tangible principle to a subjective concept shaped by political agenda, religious affiliation, and previous experience of the legal system. Australia was dominated by positivist and liberalist theories 109 until feminism, post- structuralism, and ecological approaches took influence. 110 Traditional liberalist concepts of individuality, formal equality, and property ownership were devalued. Now, fluctuating cultural conventions determine what values inform the legal system in our increasingly permissive society. Research indicates six-month-old babies possess an innate sense of justice. 111 While the average citizen might hope and trust that our legal system is synonymous with what they innately sense justice to be – it is not. Practical examples of this confront us daily, from anti- terror laws that breach international human rights standards, 112 to unfathomably lenient sentencing for men who rape young children. 113 Personal experience drives home the reality that justice is nothing more than the excrement of Orwellian newspeak , a mythical, abstract ideal that law students write essays about, and promise to preserve in the forefront of their minds while earning $500 per hour at their inner-city law firms. Only those who have yet to experience injustice can afford to pontificate about an actual relationship between law and a concept that can no long er even be defined, let alone exacted. Ancient Concepts of Justice Plato (428-348 BC) believed justice stems from social order. 114 He proposed private citizens forgo individuality and personal rights for a state controlled by a gifted minority who regulate everything from sex to moral thinking. 115 Plato’s ideal society was modeled on Sparta, 116 aligns with modern totalitarianism, and inspired Hitler’s Third Reich. 117 By contrast, Aristotle (384-322 BC) believed in natural justice. 118 He saw justice as: transcending local customs and conventions, determined by divine reason, and inherently connected to law. 119 Aristotle believed a just society stems from allowing citizens to enjoy the private property they worked for, and that property redistribution is unjust.

Their concept of justice, which encouraged freedom and responsibility, passed to English law. Christian Siedentop 124 argues that a moral revolution occurred in the 1 st Century after the New Testament writings introduced the notion that everyone has God-given rights. This revolution inspired Medieval Christian philosophers and canon lawyers to promote individual freedom and moral equality. These men, and not the secular humanist philosophers of the Renaissance or Enlightenment, formed the foundations of Western liberal democracy. 125 Biblical Christianity considers justice, freedom and law inseparable. Hayes 126 observed: Wherever Christian ideals have been generally accepted and their practice sincerely attempted, there is a dynamic liberty; and wherever Christianity has been ignored or rejected, persecuted or chained to the state, there is tyranny. This statement makes no sense if 1 st Century Christianity, an individual belief system with no formal organization, is equated with tyrannical collectivist religious organizations like the Roman Catholic Church. Roman Catholicism started with Emperor Constantine I (306-337) who retained his title of pontifex maximus pope , and rebranded Roman paganism as ‘Christianity’ and superimposed Christian motifs over Roman cult practices and festivals (Christmas and Easter ) in honor of sun worship and the goddess Ishtar. 127 Dog excrement by any other name still stinks, and the same organization that fed Christians to lions continued persecuting Christians via a series of Crusades and Inquisitions. 128 The Protestant Reformation was a protest of orthodox Bible-reading Christians against the satanic Roman Catholic papal system. The uninformed confuse Protestantism with Catholicism and wrongly group them under the one label of ‘Christian.’ Because organizations like the Catholic Church committed heinous acts of injustice, people used this to justify condemning the orthodox Christian values that informed our Western legal system. Medieval Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) introduced distributive justice theory, 129 a vague and indeterminate form of justice which, if violated, leaves no identifiable offence or perpetrator. Aquinas was an Italian priest and apologist for the Catholic Church. Accordingly, he viewed 120 William McGovern, ‘Collectivism and Individualism ,’ in Felix Morley (ed), Essays on Individu ality , (Stratford Press , 1958) 339. 121 Larry Siedentop, Inventing the Individual: The Origins of Western Liberalism (Belknap Press, 2014). 122 Will Durrant, The Story of Civilization, Part II I: Caesar and Christ (Simon & Schuster, 2011). 123 Ibid. 124 Larry Siedentop, above n19. 125 Ibid. 126 Carlton Hayes, Christianity and Western Civilization (Stanford University Press, 1954) 21. 127 Ibid. 128 Edward Clarke, Commentary on the Bible (1831). 129 Philosophy of Law Study Guide (2014)."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" 167 the pope as supreme law giver and laws inconsistent with Catholic doctrine as invalid. Aquinas replaced Augustine’s (354-430) idea that unjust laws are not laws, with the notion that unjust laws should be tolerated for practical reasons 130 (i.e., submission to the Roman Catholic pope. Common Law The common law system is based on Judeo -Christian principles. 131 Edward Coke (1552 –1634) believed God gave humans an innate understanding of the law. Therefore, justice manifested in a judge’s ability to correctly discover and apply Biblical law. Just laws were based on, and did not contradict, individual rights and free choice. When Coke said, ‘ The King himself should be under no man, but under God and the Law, ’ 132 he referred to the Rule of Law whereby everyone is bound by fixed and predictable rules. Without objective law, individuals are at the government’s mercy. The alternative is the rule of man, which results in tyranny. 133 Common law offers basic protective measures including the right to silence and presumption of innocence. William Blackstone’s (1723-1780) Commentary on the Laws of England influenced common law adoption by English speaking countries, plus the USA Declaration of Independence and Constitution . 134 Blackstone traced English common law to King Alfred’s Scripture -based legal system. 135 While the 10 Commandments formed a moral premise that was easy for the public to know, Blackstone made the common law further accessible to lay people. 136 He also promoted inalienable rights. 137 Blackstone said England’s Bill of Rights declared three immunities: private property, personal security and individual freedom, 138 and that the common law ‘ ...gives liberty, rightly understood, that is protection to a Jew, a Turk, or a heathen, as well as those that profess the true religion of Christ’. 139 Atheistic Atheism undermines the notion of a higher moral law. It encourages relativism - the denial of absolute truth and moral code. Without absolutes, morality is determined by social norms and individual discretion, and people have no sense of moral obligation or duty. Atheist Claude Helvetius (1715-1771) heavily influenced Bentham and Marx. 140 He believed humans are a product of their environment and culture. Helvetius said the meaning of life is attaining earthly happiness for the greatest number, not salvation. Helvetius advocated self-love, and valued actions by their public utilitarian use. 141 130 M.

Darwinism was a pro - eugenics political movement that assumed God does not exist and humans are evolving animals. The Darwinian concept of law and justice stem s from man’s will that evolves over time with changing social values and conventions. Darwinism influenced Maxism and Nazism. 142 It also influenced secular humanism which similarly assumes only nature and the material world exist, and humans are evolving toward perfection (i.e., ‘mechanised’). These theories dismiss natural law and an absolute moral code. They base morality on the changing nature of human interaction. Positivist Darwinism influenced positivism. In Pure Theory of Law (1939) Hans Kelsen (1881 - 1973) said, ‘ The changeover of legal science from natural law to positivism went hand in hand with the progress of empirical natural sciences and with a critical analysis of religious ideology’. 143 Positivist Jeremy Bentham (1748 -1832) rejected God and natural law, and declared law a product of human will and reason, force and social struggle. 144 These theorists believed laws are logically formulated by the state to suit society’s evolving needs. That Positivists consider law manmade, 145 separates law and morality. Positivists consider law just if it benefits the population majority. 146 So, j ustice fluctuates according to the whims and preferences of the state. Its arbitrary nature renders a Positivist legal system susceptible to tyranny. Positivist John Austin (1790 -1859) aimed to transform law into a science by purging it of all moralistic notions. He asserted that law is the command of ‘a sovereign who requires full obedience’ 147 - which sounds pretty much like a tyrant. Hart (1907-1992) concluded that Austin’ s theory in effect posed a sovereign threat. 148 Positivism ignores individual rights, natural justice, and outcome fairness. 149 Owing to Positivism, our courts are more concerned with rules and exacting procedural justice, rather than the law’s ethical implications. 150 Positivism fails to make the common law distinction between natural wrongs that everyone wants criminalised (like murder) and behaviours that the government prohibits but which the public generally accept, such as defending one’s family against a violent intruder; a prime example being the Batterham case 151 which also contradicted the common law allowance of proportionate use of force against a perpetrator. 142 Conway Zirkle, Evolution, Marxian Biology, and the Social Sciences (University of Pennsylvania, 1959). 143 Augusto Zimmermann, ‘Evolutionary Legal Theories: The Impact of Darwinism on Western Conceptions of Law’ (2010) 24(2) Journal of Creation 103. 144 Philosophy of Law Study Guide (2014). 145 Ibid. 146 Ibid. 147 Ibid. 148 Legal Process Study Guide (2015). 149 Ibid. 150 Legal Process Study Guide (2015). 151 Belinda Geary and Brianne Tolj, ‘Father is charged with murder after a man who he caught 'rummaging through his daughter's bedroom' dies during attempted citizen's arrest,’ Daily Mail (online), 28 March 2016."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 169 Social Contract Social contract theorists tried to reconcile Christianity with Darwinism. They defined a ‘social contract’ as an agreement people made in the state of nature before society existed. According to this philosophy, the public sacrifice freedom for social order and state- administered justice . Philosophers have different ideas about the state’s role in this social contract. Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) advocated for absolutism - the absolute right of the state to control the individual. 152 Hobbes’ collectivism was a precursor of modern totalitarianism. 153 Hobbes diverted focus from natural law which encouraged altruism, to a sense of entitlement. Unlike Blackstone and Locke, Hobbes was not considered influential in his day, and he made no significant contribution to the legal system. He was rejected by both major parties of his day 154 and Oxford University burnt his writings. 155 Liberalist As a social contract theorist, John Locke (1632–1704) considered the consequences of when a government fails to uphold their contractual obligation. 156 He believed people had rights to life, health, liberty, and property in the state of nature. 157 Locke believed these rights stemmed from God-given natural laws that people could easily recognise using their God- given reason. As the father of liberalism, Locke’s support for inalienable, individual rights inspired the 1776 American Declaration of Independence , 1789 Bill of Rights , and 1793 French Declaration on Human and Citizens' Rights . 158 Locke’s ideals are reflected in the legal syste m via notions of presumption of innocence, procedural fairness, a fair trial, and non- discrimination. 159 Enlightenment Unlike Hobbes and Locke, Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) claimed life in the state of nature was good. 160 He inspired Romanticism, an emotive philosophy that promoted a return to the alleged ‘bliss’ of a pre -civil society. Leftist collectivist ideology originated with Rousseau who claimed rights which existed in the state of nature are relinquished to the state -created general will . 161 Rousseau damned civil society for permitting private interest which, he claimed, exploits others and detracts from the general will. Charles Darwin's philosophy was previously suggested by others including Immanuel Kant (1724–1804). 162 Kant agreed with Hobbes and Rousseau that humans chose to surrender their rights to the state when they created the state. 163 He said a government has no duty to its citizens, but that: ‘It is the duty of the people to bear any abuse of the supreme power , even 152 William McGovern, From Luther to Hitler; The History of Fascist- Nazi Political Philosophy .

Marxist Darwin, Rousseau, and Kant inspired Carl Marx (1818-1883). 167 Marx rejected Christianity, natural law, private property, individual rights, separation of powers, and the Rule of Law. 168 He viewed law as a tool for political power and based it on the working class’ collective will. Marxism promotes lawlessness via contempt for existing social order and encouraging the working class to violently revolt against government. 169 Marx believed the need for law dissolves once communism is established. Marx was anti -Semitic. 170 Not surprisingly, every application of Marxism has resulted in totalitarianism, deification of a dictator, human rights violations, inequality before the law, and the equal distribution of poverty. 171 This is reflected in mass killings of over 100 million people by Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. Thus, Marxist law has proven to be the antithesis of justice. Radical Multiculturalism Marxism influenced contemporary theories including radical feminism, critical legal studies, and race legal theory. These theories agree that reality is socially constructed to create and maintain power . 172 They consider talk of justice, universal truth, and objective knowledge as white patriarchal attempts to gain political power over minority groups. 173 Such theories view law as a socially constructed tool for political gain. 174 They are pro-social justice for leftist political purposes. Their goal is not to create an overall fair legal system or an efficient government but encourage minority groups to pursue radical political change. 175 Ironically, these theories promote anti-Semitism. 176 Collectivist Ideology . Fascism, feminism, race legal theory, dialectical materialism, critical legal theory, socialism, deconstruction, post-modernism, ecological jurisprudence, and all other theories that advocate for government ownership and wealth redistribution are forms of collectivist ideology . Collectivism purports that individuality is a socially constructed phenomenon, since 164 Emmanuel Kant, The Philosophy of Law: An Exposition of the Fundamental Principles of Jurisprudence as the Science of Right (T & T Clarke, 1887) . 165 Philosophy of Law Study Guide (2014). 166 Ibid. 167 George Knupffer, The Struggle for World Power (Noontide, 4 th Ed , 1986). 168 Karl Marx, Early Writings (Penguin, 2005) 169 Daniel Farber and Suzanna Sherry, Beyond All Reason: The Radical Assault on Truth in American Law (Oxford University Press, 1997) . 170 Karl Marx, On the Jewish Question (1844). 171 David Koyzis, Political Visions & Illusions (InterVarsity Press, 2009). 172 Daniel Farber and Suzanna Sherry, Beyond All Reason: The Radical Assault on Truth in American Law (Oxford University Press, 1997) . 173 Ibid. 174 Ibid. 175 Ibid. 176 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 171 individuals did not exist in the state of nature. 177 Collectivism is a political-economic movement that subjugates individuals to a group, and forces interdependence. 178 People are grouped (by gender, race, class, etc) and this group identity determines whether individual behaviour is right or wrong. Consequently, morality is determined by our common humanity . 179 Individual Rights Erosion The meaning of rights has changed to suit collectivist bias. Inalienable individual rights have been reinterpreted as minority group rights. Owing to the disregard for individual rights, and because law is not fixed, individual rights are overridden by an arbitrary government equally capable of violating, as implementing, rights. 180 An example is the myriad of Australian anti-terror laws introduced since 2002. Most were expedited without the usual parliamentary and civil considerations. 181 This lack of procedur e undermined the democratic values and rights found in our Constitution, common law, and other legislation. Australia has no federal human rights legislation to ensure anti-terrorism laws comply with international human rights standards. 182 Consequently, anti-terror legislation infringes upon basic rights including a fair trial, privacy, freedom from arbitrary detention and arrest, non -discrimination, freedom of association and expression, retrospective law, and recognition under law. Historically, such denial of individual rights has preceded totalitarianism. 183 Tyrannical Consequences Legal system change begins with the education of student lawyers. 184 Our law texts cherry pick history to support leftist bias. Law professors highlight Marxism but omit its link to holocaust; 185 elevate fascist Hobbes above the father of Common Law; 186 187 188 criticise liberalist notions of individualism, formal equality, and property ownership; 189 favour abandonment of objective truth, moral absolutism, and a universally accepted sta ndard of justice in preference for moral relativism; 190 and encourage students to care more for the rights of trees rather than humans. 191 The pro-Marxist university lecturers who undermine the foundations of our Western legal system simultaneously enjoy the freedom and rights this same system affords them. 192 It comes as no surprise then, that there is no longer an identifiable relationship between justice and the law. 177 William McGovern, ‘Collectivism and Individualism ’, in Felix Morley (ed), Essays on Individuality (Stratford Press , 1958) 339. 178 Ibid. 179 Philosophy of Law Study Guide (2014). 180 Simon Bronitt and Bernadette McSherry, Principles of Criminal Law (Thomson Reuters Australia, 3 rd ed, 2010). 181 George Williams, ‘A Decade of Australian Anti -terror Laws’ (2011) Melbourne University Law Review 35. 182 Australian Human Rights Commission, how are Human Rights Protected in Australian Law?

While n one of the FOI-released documents exposed the truth that children were the ultimate Manchurian Candidates, about 40 percent of the documents pertained to the CIA’s interest in the occult , a fact useful to this chapter. Sidney Gottlieb initiated Project OFTEN -CHICKWIT to study parapsychology and the occult, to ‘explore the world of black magic’ and ‘harness the forces of darkness and challenge the concept that the inner reaches of the mind are beyond reach.’ Under OFTEN, the CIA visited with and recruited fortune -tellers, palm-readers, clairvoyants, astrologists, mediums, psyc hics, specialists in demonology, witches and warlocks, Satanists, and other occult practitioners. They established a research laboratory at the University of South Carolina and recruited student guinea pigs via a college class in black witchcraft, demonolo gy and voodoo. Project OFTEN built on the library of knowledge the Nazi’s acquired by scouring the globe collecting occult practices including trauma -based mind control techniques. During their height of power, the Nazis conducted Luciferian rituals in the streets of Germany in broad daylight. Winston Churchill fittingly wrote of Hitler: He had conjured up the fearful idol of an all-devouring Moloch of which he was the priest and incarnation. 193 Darwin -Galton -Huxley -Wedgewood Dynasty MK-ULTRA and the occult are inseparable. MK -ULTRA was founded on occultic practises by occultists. To understand this, we must examine the spiritual and philosophical beliefs and practises of the people behind MK -ULTRA, the covert Rothschilds and their ove rt operatives, the Darwin-Galton-Huxley-Wedgewood dynasty. Aldous Huxley was the evil revolutionary who conceived and facilitated MK -ULTRA in the USA. His brother Julian Huxley coined the term ‘transhumanism’ and founded the eugenicist UNESCO to achieve t heir transhumanist end goal. Julian and his Australian relative Leonard Huxley coordinated MK -ULTRA in Australia. Aldous and Julian Huxley were the grandsons of biologist, anthropologist and philosopher Thomas Huxley (1825-1895) who co- founded the occultic Imperialist British Round Table Society .

According to the Jewish Encyclopedia (1906, Vol.2, p.497 ) the Rothschilds ‘ are the guardians of the papal treasure.’ The Cult taught me to revere the Rothschilds as demigods (Nephilim) .

The close ties between the London-based Hofjuden families and the British oligarchy trace back to the founding of the Bank of England, and before that to an alliance with the pirates who financed post-Renaissance Genoa in North- West Italy. The three Jewish authors of Dope Inc . (1978) explain this history: Several of the Hofjuden families who converged on London during the 17th and 18th centuries had served the Genoese bankers in their takeover of Holland, had participated in the Dutch East India Company's first expeditions in opium trade, and had collaborated over the centuries with the British Jesuits against European humanist forces... The Montefiores trace their origin as ‘special operations’ experts for the European oligarchy to the 13th century in Spain, when they ran errands as tax farmers and Inquisitors for their masters, the Genoese. The Montefiores later moved to Holland to help found the Dutch East India Company and the Bank of Holland. After the Stuart Restoration of the mid-17th century, the Montefiores moved to England where they helped establish the Bank of England and the British East India Company. Under Sir Moses Montefiore, the family collaborated with Lord Palmerston and Prime Minister Disraeli in the founding of the present-day Zionist ‘movement...’ Rothschilds, Warburgs, Oppenheimers, Schroeders, and other Hofjuden became the leading financial backers of Adolf Hitler.

The three Jewish authors of Dope Inc. (1978) asserted the Hofjuden are not true Jews. The Bible says: I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan . (Rev. 2:9) The Synagogue of Satan created the Zionist movement and stamped the Luciferian hexagram on Israel’s flag which they named the ‘Star of David.’ The hexagram had nothing to do with King David, and David had nothing to do with witchcraft or Luciferianism. The hexagram represents the pagan god Astarte. Hence the Rothschilds adopted a red hexagram (Red Shield) as their family crest and on their subsidiaries including the Salvation Army. T he Luciferians call the hexagram the ‘ Seal of Solomon .’ Fritz Springmeier explains: Throughout the Middle Ages the Seal of Solomon had been used by Arab Magicians, Cabalist Magicians, Druid witches and Satanists. One of the few ancient uses of the symbol was on the floor of a 1,200 -year -old Moslem Mosque found where Tel Aviv is today. In the twelve century an Ashkenazic Jew Menahem Ben Duji, who thought he was the Messiah, used the magical symbol. Because the Rothschilds were Satanists they adopted this powerful magic symbol in 1822 for their coat -of-arms. David’s son Solomon defied God’s law by substituting Jewish brides with a thousand pagan whores who seduced him into satanism. Consequently, Israel permanently split into two kingdoms. Ten tribes rejected Solomon’s son by a pagan wife as their king, split off and formed the northern kingdom called Israel. Two southern tribes formed the kingdom of Judah under Solomon’s pagan offspring. Consider the following 1836 quote: The Rothschilds are the wonders of modern banking. Sprung from that poetic, that ancient, that mysterious race, from whom we derive all our religion and half of our civilization, we see the descendants of Judah, after a persecution of two thousand years, peering above kings, rising higher than emperors, and holding a whole continent in the hollow of their hands. The Rothsch ilds govern a Christian world. Not a cabinet moves without their advice. They stretch their hand, with equal ease, from Petersburg to Vienna, from Vienna to Paris, from Paris to London, from London to Washington. Baron Rothschild, the head of the house, is the true king of Judah, the prince of the captivity, the Messiah so long looked for by this extraordinary people. He holds the keys of peace or war, blessing or cursing. To what will all this lead? If the holy city to be rebuilt? – the third temple to rear its urrets to heaven? No. The lion of the tribe of Judah, baron Rothschild, possesses more real force than David – more wisdom than Solomon. What do they care for the barren seacoast of Palestine? They are the brokers and counsellors of the kings of Euro pe and of the republican chiefs of America. What more can they desire? 194 194 H. Niles (Ed.) (1835). Niles' Weekly Register .

The y are responsible for the growing antisemitism brewing another holocaust, because people think the Zionist bankers who push for the state of Israel (which was almost named ‘Zion’) and the construction of a Third Temple, are Jewish. The Rothschild’s financed the Nazi holocaust to justify the need for a Jewish homeland, with the Templar end goal of building a replacement tem ple in Jerusalem to house their coming fake Messiah, the Antichrist. The Rothschilds flooded Palestine with people whose Jewishness is determined via the maternal line. This contradicts the Torah which clearly says the male bloodline establishes Jewish heritage. The Old Testament lists pages and pages of male birth lines, not female. King David specifically addressed this issue. Women may convert to Judaism via marriage while men certainly can’t. I doubt the dome of the rock is the original site of Solomon’s temple, but of an ancient Roman fort. Former biology professor Walter Veith produced an excellent Total Onslaught series on the secret history of Freemasonry and Catholicism, in which he proves t he gold - topped Mosque is a renovated Roman Temple of Diana. Jesus clearly said ‘not one stone’ would be left of the Temple site, including the foundation stone s. I visited Jerusalem and saw numerous stones constitute the ancient Roman fort site. I agree the real Temple site was completely razed down to below its foundations, even the hill and soil it sat on were removed. Let the Communist cult of Islam created by the Roman Catholic church keep their pagan temple. The Bible is clear, God will ultimately make the Synagogue of Satan bow at the feet of His genuine Jewish people. He will restore the Jewish people to their homeland in His time: Behold, I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.

Radovan von Winterberg was an engineer and architect who claimed to be the rightful owner of Winterberg Castle which sits on the Czekoslovakian border. Radovan drove a red 260z sports car that featured UNESCO diplomatic plates. He once told me ‘Australia needs a mini-Hitler’ and he showed me drafts of Pauline Hanson’s early speeches which he claimed to have written.

At one stage Michelle headed the biological section of the Sydney Water Board's Scientific Services . The mysterious von Wint erberg couple built an underground house at Terranora and installed tight security and cameras in an ‘80s era when neighbours typically left their front doors unlocked . A sign at their entrance read ‘Project International Architects’ and featured a Freemason square and compass logo. While the average person might dismiss the sign as a reference to his house design business, I immediately took it as a reference to her human design business. Our family always speculated that Michelle was conducting illegal genetic engineering projects in their underground lair which my high IQ blue -eyed blonde father often visited. When Radovan’ s house came up for sale one owner later, I challenged my sister -in- law to inspect the place with me and see whether it could have accommodated a cloning lab. She dismissed my lunatic ravings – until we saw the house. Radovan’s underground home resembled a 1960s James Bond movie set complete with space -style shower pods, built-in fish tank, and velvet and silver wallpaper.

Order of Kappa Si gma A clue to Freemasonry’s origins is found in the Order of Kappa Sigma secret handbook published by Wikileaks. Kappa Sigma is a Freemason fraternity founded in Bologna University, Italy during the 1400s. Michelangelo was a member. The Order spread to the other four great European universities (Florence, Paris, Orleans, and Montpellier) and was preserved by French and Italian nobility. The Kappa Sigma Order of America was founded at Virginia University in 1869 and became the largest fraternity in the USA. Head CIA psychologist (my perpetrator) John W. Gittinger was initiated into Kappa-Sigma at Oklahoma University. Kappa Sigma is Greek for ‘Kirjath Sepher’ the name of an ancient city in southern Canaan. Esau was the brother of Jacob (renamed Israel) who sold God’s blessing for a bowl of stew and killed (and stole the enchanted clothes of) Nimrod who founded the ancient Babylonian mystery religion.

Some believe the Hofjuden stem from the bloodline of Esau. The Kappa Sigma symbols include the Luciferian encircled pentagram, Islamic crescent moon, and caduceus of Mercury. Kappa Sigma founder Stephen A lonzo Jackson (aka, Grand Master, or ‘Architect of Ritual’) stated: ‘Let us not rest contently until the Star [Astarte pentagram] and Crescent [moon] is the pride of every college and university throughout the land.’ 196 The fraternity is a means by which our youth are initiated into Luciferian Freemasonry and indoctrinated, like ‘Comrade Gittinger,’ with their agenda. The human skull and crossed thigh bones is another Kappa-Sigma symbol, used to remind members of their sworn oath and the punishment that awaits should they violate it (i.e., beheading and amputation). The initiation ritual involves the use of a genuine human skull and crossed thigh bones placed on an altar. John Ward, University of Sydney Vice Chancellor, created a human skull and cross bones during a Halloween ritual by skinning a child alive. The skull and crossbones symbol is a feature of the Freemasons, Jesuits, Knights Templars, knights of Malta, and Shiners. Freemasons traditionally bury human femur bones on their Lodge grounds during rituals. The Knights Templar had the world’s biggest fleet in the 13th century, and they were notorious for committing acts of ‘piracy’ . The Knights of Malta replaced them, and they too were pirates. Pirates financed post-Renaissance Genoa in North-West Italy. The skull and crossbones trace back to ancient Canaan/Sidon/Zidon , a rendezvous for pirates (aka, ‘merchants’). Sidon was a wealthy and powerful city of merchants who first produced the Royal Purple dy e worn by Emperors, popes, and Luciferian priests. Illuminati Bloodlines In mockery and imitation of God’s 12 tribes, Satan blessed 12 bloodlines. One of these bloodlines was the Ishmaeli bloodline from which a special elite line developed alchemy, assassination techniques, and other occult practices. One bloodline was Egyptian/Celtic/Druidic from which Druidism was developed. One bloodline was in the orient and developed oriental magic. One lineage was from Canaan and the Canaanites. It had the name Astarte , then Astorga, then Ashdor, and then Astor. The tribe of Dan was used as a Judas Iscariot type seed. The royalty of the tribe of Dan have descended down through history as a powerful Satanic bloodline. The 13th or final blood line was copied after God’s royal lineage of Jesus. This was the Satanic House of David with their blood which they believe is not only from the House of David but also from the lineage of Jesus, who they claim had a wife and children. The 13th Satanic bloodline was instilled with the direct seed of Satan so that they would not only carry Christ’s blood--but also the blood of his ‘brother’ Lucifer.

The Inquisition torture methods described in the following secret oath, formed the basis of CIA trauma-based mind control. Jesuit Oath I do further promise and declare that I will, when opportunity presents, make and wage relentless war, secretly and openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Masons, as I am directed to do, to extirpate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex nor condition , and that will hang, burn, waste, boil, flay, strangle, and bury alive these infamous heretics; rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women, and crush their infants' heads against the walls in order to annihilate their execrable race . That when the same can’t be done openly I will secretly use the poisonous cup, the strangulation cord, the steel of the poniard, or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honour, rank, dignity or authority of the persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agents of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Father of the Society of Jesus. 202 I witnessed my Jesuit perpetrators commit the crimes described in the above oath. Everything damning and true that was written about the Jesuits back in the 17 th Century was, hundreds of years later, declared a ‘forgery’ by Catholic priests or Jesuit Institute publications. Jesuit Perpetrators The Jesuits are prominent in Australia and amongst my perpetrators. Roman Emperor Ratzinger , a former Nazi, is the first Jesuit pope. Ex-PM Tony Abbott is a Jesuit. Former Labour Party leader Bill Shorten, who escaped a rape conviction because his victim lubricated during penetration and therefore ‘wanted it’ - is a Jesuit. Leonas Petrauskas was schooled by Jesuits in Lithuania and associated with Jesuits in PNG. Antony Kidman had strong Jesuit ties. Kidman attended a Sydney Jesuit school, Saint Aloysius College , with his brother who commenced Jesuit training but abandoned this due to his schizophrenia. The Kidman family attended Star of The Sea Jesuit Church in North Sydney. The Kidman’s family priest was Jesuit Father Paul Coleman who officiated Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban’s 2006 marriage, and Antony Kidman’s 2014 funeral, at St Mary’s North Sydney. This is the same church where the fake funeral of my Jesuit trained perpetrator (and Sydney Grande Dame ) Patricia Anne Conlon was held. 202 Carlos Didier (1843). Subterranean Rome. New York.

The Roman Catholic priestly order stems from the ancient Roman Cult of Mithraism which my British husband and his father, of the Gardiner Illuminati bloodline, were initiated into. Mithraism is so secretive you will find no records of their beliefs and practises. Mithraism rank initiates based on IQ level, and conduct ceremonies in which priests ‘marry’ boy brides - which might explain the epidemic of Catholic priests raping altar boys. I also know from experience that the Roman Catholic high mass is a watered-down version of the Luciferian black mass. Order of the Illuminati In 1527, Ignatius of Loyola was let off with a warning by a Christian court for sympathising with the Alumbrados of Spain (aka, Spanish Illuminati). In 1534, Loyola founded the Jesuit Order. In 1773, the Pope ordered the suppression of the Jesuits, and Adam Weishaupt became professor of Canon Law at a Jesuit University. In 1776, Weishaupt founded the Order of the Illuminati. Illuminati is synonymous with Luciferianism. Illuminated means ‘to make luminous’ while Lucifer means ‘light-bringer.’ My perpetrators referred to the entire Luciferian network as ‘The Order.’ In his 1797 book ‘ Proofs of a Conspiracy Against all the Religions and Governments of Europe Carried on in the Secret Meetings of Freemasons, Illuminati, and Reading Societies ,’ John Robison showed how the Jesuit Order and Scottish Rite of Freemasonry colluded to fulfil Adam Weishaupt’s goal of revolution. Luciferian Eugenicist Agenda The Galton-Huxley-Darwin-Wedgewood families were eugenicists who, in Luciferian bloodline tradition, intermarried to preserve their bloodlines and maintain their wealth and influence. Their relationship is demonstrated by a January 1874 séance conducted at Erasmu Alvey Darwin’s house which was arranged by spiritualist Francis Galton and attended by Charles Galton Darwin, Hensleigh Wedgwood, and Thomas Henry Huxley. Charles Galton Darwin’s great-grandson married Thomas Huxley’s great- granddaughter. Charles Darwin shared a grandfather with Francis Galton, who coined the word ‘eugenics’ in 1883 and founded the international eugenics movement. Thomas Huxley coined the term ‘Darwinism’ and was responsible for promoting his relative Charles Galton Darwin’s philosophy of evolution, which was originally titled: On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the PRESERVATION OF FAVOURED RACES in the Struggle for Life. Marxist educators typically omit the second half of Darwin’s title which indicates Darwin was a eugenicist. The Darwin-Galton-Huxley-Wedgewood eugenicist agenda was survival of the Luciferian elite a nd annihilation of the masses. Communism, the universal symbol of which is a red Luciferian pentagram, has the same goal. "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 183 Darwin’s proof of evolutionary changes in species – an evolution which proceeds by mathematical laws, not by the conscious design of a Creator – was soon incorporated in mechanistic theories of man and society. Social Darwinism fitted equally well into the arguments of apologists for capitalism like Herbert Spencer and William Graham Sumner, precursors of fascism like the Austrian sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz, and the influential Communist theorists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. 203 All Darwinism is Social Darwinism, the application of ‘natural selection and preservation of favoured races’ to human society. Darwin was influenced by Thomas Robert Malthus, whose theory of population control advocated for reducing population numbers via deliberate neglect and passive annihilation. Darwinism combined with Malthusianism produced three arms of the same dialectic : 1. National Socialism in Nazi Germany, 2. International Socialism in Marxist Russia, 3. Corporate Capitalism headed by the USA. Charles Galton Darwin's son Leonard was an Army Major, MP, and 1912 president of London’s First International Congress of Eugenics. Leonard Darwin associated with Harry Hamilton Laughlin, Expert Eugenics Agent of the US House of Representatives. As superintendent of the Eugenics Record Office, Laughlin oversaw the collection of prominent family pedigrees including the Galton-Darwin-Huxley-Wedgewood dynasty. High profile American eugenicists included Alexander Graham Bell (the fraud who stole Antonio Meucci’s telephone invention 204 ) and David Starr Jordan (Stanford University’s first President). David Star Jordan coined the term dysgenics, referring to defective or disadvantageous genes and traits in offspring of a population. Aldous Huxley adopted the term as follows: Among the Brave New Worlders, the control of human nature was achieved by eugenic and dysgenic breeding, by systematic conditioning during infancy [which] is as old as Pavlov. 205 H.H. Laughlin’s publications promoted racial segregation and sterilisation of ‘hereditary defectives.’ In 1922, Laughlin published the Model Sterilization Law mandating the involuntary sterilization of ‘useless’ people. Thirty USA states passed laws allowing sterilization of mentally ill, diseased, blind, orphaned, homeless, disabled people, and criminals. Laughlin's Model Sterilization Law provided the model for, and was virtually identical to, the Nazi sterilisation laws resulting in 2 million sterilizations. 206 In 1936, the Nazi- run Heidelberg University awarded Laughlin an honorary MD degree ‘in recognition of studies 203 Alan Scheflin & Edward Opton (1978).

Communist Revolution The Soviet Union caused tens of millions of deaths, far more than Nazi Germany. Like Nazism, Communism stemmed from occultism and is violently anti-Biblical. 207 Russian author and historian Alexander Solzhenitsyn (1918 - 2008) wrote: Within the philosophical system of Marx and Lenin, and at the heart of their psychology, hatred of God is the principal driving force , more fundamental than all their political and economic pretensions. Russian Communist Party leader Leon Trotsky wrote: In the 18th century, Freemasonry became expressive of a militant policy of enlightenment, as in the case of the Illuminati , who were the forerunners of revolution . 208 Trotsky said leftist Illuminati members became the Italian ‘Carbonari’ secret revolutionary societies that spread socialist ideas and achieved prominence during the Napoleonic French revolution. (Napoleon named himself New Apollyon after the god Apollo. ) Illuminism was among the many occult philosophies of the time, with influences from the ancient belief systems of Gnosticism and Hermeticism . It was based on a loose idea of personal enlightenment through reason, with a heavy focus on materialism and the nature of man - and often with strong anti -religious and anti-government overtones. Destruction of moral restraint and the deification of human nature over suppression of divine aspirations, is fundamental to Communist ideology. Communism basically amounts to rebellion against God and a hatred and destruction of humanity. Hence the Luciferian end goal is to oppose and destroy everything God stated and created and replace these with genetically engineered and mechanised replicas. Our youth, indoctrinated with the philosophy of evolution and the religion of scientism, are ready to embrace the final evolutionary phase of transhumanism. Man-as-Machine The man-as machine idea appealed to men’s desire to control themselves and others, to replace disorder with order, to get on the bandwagon of Science (which was 207 Joshua Philip (2017).

The list would also include such pro-fascists as Gumplowicz, and the founders of Communism, Marx and Engels ... The cost of this controlled happiness was to be the extinction of human liberty... 209 The Final Revolution Throughout history, the Rothschilds and their predecessors orchestrated and financed every major revolution (Industrial, French, Communist, etc). There is coming a Final Revolution to end all revolutions. This final revolution, psychological in nature, inspired Project MK -ULTRA, and will be expedited by nuclear war. Out of the ashes of chaos a dystopian new world order will arise like the Luciferian phoenix, complete with tyrannical dictator . The Bible predicts this, and so did Aldous Huxley, the evil revolutionary who founded and coordinated Project MK -ULTRA in the USA. The coming social order will combine Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World with George Orwell’s 1984 . Both 1930s novels are proving to be more blueprint than fiction. Aldous Huxley compared the two books in a letter he wrote George Orwell from California, 21 October 1949: 210 The first hints of a philosophy of the ultimate revolution — the revolution which lies beyond politics and economics, and which aims at total subversion of the individual's psychology and physiology — are to be found in the Marquis de Sade, who regarded himself as the continuator, the consummator, of Robespierre and Babeuf... My own belief is that the ruling oligarchy will find less arduous and wasteful ways of governing and of satisfying its lust for power, and these ways will resemble those which I described in Brave New World... I have had occasion recently to look into the history of animal magnetism and hypnotism, and have been greatly struck by the way in which, for a hundred and fifty years, the world has refused to take serious cognizance of the discoveries of Mesmer, Braid, Esdaile, and the rest... But now psychoanalysis is being combined with hypnosis; and hypnosis has been made easy and indefinitely extensible through the use of barbiturates, which induce a hypnoid and suggestible state in even the most recalcitrant subjects. 209 Alan Scheflin & Edward Opton (1978).

Aldous Huxley repeated his goal of ‘Final Revolution’ as follows: We have had religious revolutions, we have had political, industrial, economic and nationalistic revolutions. All of them, as our descendants will discover, were but ripples in an ocean of conservatism – trivial by comparison with the psychological revolution toward which we are so rapidly moving. That will really be a revolution. When it is over, the human race will give no further trouble . 211 There will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies , so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them, but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods . And this seems to be the final revolutio n . 212 Aldous Huxley recruited to MK-ULTRA the famous behavioural psychologist, B.F. Skinner, who wrote a novel in the dystopian tradition. In Walden Two , Skinner echoed Aldous Huxley writings concerning a psy chological revolution: Now that we know how positive reinforcement works, and why negative doesn’t, we can be more deliberate and hence more successful, in our cultural design. We can achieve a sort of control under which the controlled...nevertheless feel free . They are doing what they want to do, not what they are forced to do. That’s the source of the tremendous power of positive reinforcement —there’s no restraint and no revolt . By a careful design, we control not the final behavior, but the inclination to behave - the motives, the desires, the wishes. The curious thing is that in that case the question of freedom never arises. 213 Dystopian Predictive Programming Before Hollywood, literature and reading groups provided the vehicle for cultural change.

H.G. Wells in turn educated George Orwell who wrote 1984 and Animal Farm. Wells also educated Thomas Huxley’s grandsons Julian and Aldous Huxley at Oxford. Aldous Huxley taught high school French to George Orwell. Brave New World Aldous Huxley wrote his 1932 classic Brave New World in H.G. Well’s dystopian style. Huxley’s novel plus 1984 were essential cult reading prescribed by the Grande Dame who trained me.

He founded , and was first Director General of, UNESCO ( United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation ) the UN’s propaganda arm for implementing cultural revolution. Julian Huxley coined the term ‘transhumanism’ to describe a philosophical movement that advocates for using technology to enhance human physiology and intellect. Huxley said: I believe in transhumanism: once there are enough people who can truly say that, the human species will be on the threshold of a new kind of existence, as different from ours as ours is from that of Peking man. It will at last be consciously fulfilling its real destiny . 218 Huxley’s transhumanism is synonymous with Huxley’s eugenics: Critics have likened transhumanism to a modern -day version of eugenics, the discredited field of improving the human race through controlled breeding. 219 In his 1947 book, UNESCO: Its Purpose and its Philosophy, Julian Huxley described his plans for achieving global cultural control. 220 He propose d combating the ‘ inequality of man and races ’ with ‘ the democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men .’ (This echoes the Freemasonic creed of the French Revolution, ‘Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, Solidarity.’) Eugenics was his primary tool for achieving equality: ...the other primary aim of eugenics should be the raising of the mean of all desirable qualities.

Julian Huxley alluded to the Luciferian end goal of radical population reduction by proposing the existence of an optimal population number: ‘... there is an optimum range of human population density, and of total population in the world .’ (p.15). Huxley d ared not disclose his optimal population figure, which would have exposed the Luciferian plan to (a) preserve a minority of wealthy, healthy, high IQ cult initiates who serve, and are useful to the collective , and (b) annihilation of the ‘dead weight.’ ...the dead weight of genetic stupidity, physical weakness, mental inability, and disease proneness , which already exists in the human species, will prove too great a burden for real progress to be achieved. Thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thin kable . (p.21) Julian Huxley proposed using Communist propaganda to force cultural change upon a reluctant Judeo-Christian society: Taking the techniques of persuasion and information and true propaganda that we have learnt to apply nationally in war, and deliberately bending them to the international tasks of peace, if necessary utilising them, as Lenin envisaged, to ‘overcome the resistance of millions’ to desirable change. (p.60) On page 12, Huxley emphasised the need for ‘provision of birth control facilities.’ The term ‘birth control’ was coined by one of H.G. Well’s many mistresses. Besides birth control, Luciferian eugenicist methods of population control include famine, war, unequal distribution of planetary resources, biological warfare, fluoride (an aluminium waste product), GMO and other food contaminates, fracking and other environmental poisoning, vaccination, pharmaceuticals, radiation, crime, sexual promiscuity and sexually transmitted dise ases, euthanasia, destruction of heterosexual marriage, divorce, abortion and suicide. Like Julian Huxley said, he would use propaganda to overcome our resistance and make the unthinkable thinkable. The unthinkable slaughter of newborn babies is now thinkable, as the US currently debate the legalisation of ‘post -birth’ abortion. My childhood abusers called this ritual child sacrifice . Julian Huxley suggested recruiting artists, critics, historians, anthropologists, divines, theologians, archaeologists, poets, and academics to help introduce a focus on Eastern and primitive indigenous culture to the West. He said, ‘the development of culture in the various regions of the Orient must receive equal attention to that paid to its Western growth.’ This cultural embracement would include Eastern and primitive pagan, shamanic, witchcraft, occultic, spiritual, and sexual practices."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 190 On page 13, Julian Huxley blatantly revealed the end goal of ‘evolutionary progress’ is a ‘one world sovereignty’ that opposes Christianity: ...two opposing philosophies of life confront each other from the West and from the East...

Communism opposes the Rule of Law. The Lawless One beheads dissenters who refuse to comply with the Luciferian New World Order. The coming regime will mandate child sacrifice and mandated DNA-altering vaccinations which switch off the death gene and qualify recipients for eternal hellfire. Huxley insinuates what the Bible clearly states, that people will be forced to choose between two ways of life: Christian versus atheistic, Luciferian communism. Julian Huxley ’s World Health Organisation The World Health Organisation is the UN’s public health branch. Julian Huxley, Margaret Mead (anthropologist), and three pioneers in development psychology - John Bowlby, Erick Erikson , and Jean Piaget - attended monthly WHO meetings in Geneva (1953- 56) to discuss child psychobiology. The proceedings were published by Tavistock , the UK’s mind con trol research centre . John Bowlby also attended similar weekly meetings at the Tavistock Clinic. Four Tavistock Study Groups (held in 1959, 1961, 1963 and 1965) were called ‘Ciba-symposia’ because they were funded and arranged by the Swiss ‘Ciba’ foundation (renamed ‘Novartis’ ). Ciba published a journal called Ciba Symposia. The 1947 edition of the journal tellingly featured three articles about ‘ Early Psychotherapy’ - Psychotherapeutic aspects of Shamanism , Egyptian Psychotherapy , and Psychotherapy in the Greek and Roman World . 222 Aldous Huxley role as US MK-ULTRA coordinator is indicated by his corresponde nce with MK-ULTRA doctors. For instance, Colgate University Library possesses George Estabrooks’ unpublished documents pertaining to his MK -ULTRA research. A ‘1962’ file contains correspondence between Estabrooks and Milton, Erickson, Martin Orne, and Aldous Huxley. John Bowlby (At tachment Theory pioneer) and Aldous Huxley exposed their intentions for humankind during correspondence regarding Bowlby’s ape attachment experiments. Bowlby modified the relationship between the mother ape and her baby which resulted in a retarded baby chimp. Huxley praised this result as an example of the ability to destroy the human genetic code.

The ancient Egyptian oligarchies organized themselves into priesthoods and created numerous seemingly contending pagan cults. This Hegelian-Dialectic approach was emulated by the Huxley - Wedgewood family in Britain, the USA and Australia. Hence the emergence of many interrelated occultic groups which my Sydney perpetrators belonged to. All secret societies stem from the ancient mystery religions. Greco-Roman mystery religions were cults that required secret initiation and ritual practice. It was strictly forbidden to reveal the practises to outsiders. All mystery religions in turn stem from Babylonia n Luciferianism, hence all secret societies practice Luciferianism at their top levels. Luciferianism, the religion of the world’s wealthiest families, includes pedophilia and child murder as religious ritual. The secret services (including the CIA, Mossad, MI6 and ASIO) operate as their private police force, and most secret service members are themselves Luciferian pedophiles. Thus, Omaha Nebraska child trafficking victims were dropped at Offutt Airforce Base to be raped by CIA pedophile staff. Children o f the Sun Edward Bulwer-Lytton developed the secret Dionysian cult Children of the Sun into which the children of the British Round Table Society were initiated. Dionysus (Roman Bacchus) was the Ancient Greek god of wine, fertility, ritual madness, religious ecstasy, and theatre. Cult members engaged in perverted, drug-fuelled sexual orgies involving bestiality. Initiates included Aldous Huxley, his gay lover D.H. Lawrence, Aleister Crowley, T.S. Elliott, and Oswald Mosley (a fascist photographed while given the ‘heil Hitler’ salute , who had sex with his stepmother plus sister-in-law). Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn Opium addict Aleister Crowley was a British Intelligence agent and 33⁰ Freemason. Crowley founded the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (HOGD) in 1886. An Isis-Urania cult, HOGD was based on the 1877 manuscript ‘ Isis Unveiled ’ in which Russian Luciferian Helena P. Blavatsky called for the British aristocracy to organize themselves into an Isis Priesthood resembling the Ancient Egyptians. Blavatsky wrote: And now it stands proven that Satan, or the Red Fiery Dragon... Lucifer, or ‘Light - Bearer, ’ is in us: it is our Mind —our tempter and Redeemer, our intelligent liberator and Saviour from pure animalism. 223 Michael Horowitz & Cynthia Palmer (eds) (1977).

HOGD co-founders William Butler Yeats, William Westcott, and several other Bulwer - Lytton protégés were Freemasons. Westcott was also Chief of England’s Rosicrucian Society and a Theosophist. Notable HOGD initiates included Aldous Huxley, Charles Henry Allan Bennett (who introduced Buddhism to the West), plus occult -fantasy authors J.R.R. Tolkein and C.S. Lewis. H.G. Wells introduced Aldous Huxley to Aleister Crowley, who introduced Aldous to psychedelic drugs in 1929. The HOGD and its offshoots were involved with the Nazis and the British Royal family. The ‘heil Hitler’ salute, which the British Royals were filmed teaching to young princesses Elizabeth and Margaret , was a HOGD ritual sign. Hermetic Principle of Vibration 226 According to the Hermetic Principle of Vibration, ‘differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind, and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration,’ and ‘Every thought, emotion or mental state has its corresponding rate and mode of vibration.’ This Principle ‘was enunciated thousands of years ago, by the Masters of Ancient Egypt.’ ‘An understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas, enables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as well as those of others.’ This principle of vibration was researched under MK -ULTRA and applied under MK-DELTA, by Hermetic psychologists and scientists: The Hermetists were the original alchemists, astrologists and psychologists, Hermes having been the founder of these schools of thought. From astrology has grown modern astronomy; from alchemy has grown modern chemistry; from the mystic psychology has grown the modern psychology of the schools. Theosophical Society Emma Hardinge Britten (1823 - 1899) was a member of the more senior Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor and one of 17 occultists who attended the Theosophical Society ’s founding meeting at Blavatsky’s New York home on 7 September 1875. Britten wrote : The persons I came into contact with were representatives of many other countries than Great Britain. They formed one of a number of secret societies...They claimed that alchemy, medieval Rosicrucianism, and modern Freemasonry were offshoots of the original Cabala , and during the last 150 years new associations had been formed, and the parties who had introduced me into their arcanum were a society in affiliation with many others then in existence in many countries...

In Art Magic , Britten wrote of using initiation rituals and drug /meditation-induced altered states of consciousness to channel, summon and control spirits. Among the emblems most commonly seen in this connection are the following: the phallus, the lingam, the triangle, all the different methods of exhibiting the cross, the serpent with its tail in its mouth, and a vast number of such geometrical signs as include the triangle, cross and circle . 228 The lingam used to worship Shiva (Isis, Ishtar, Easter, Queen of Heaven, Catholic Mary). The ‘Ishta-lingam’ is an egg-shaped stone. The cross is an occultic symbol, since Jesus Christ was nailed to a living tree . Luciferians recognise the cross, Christmas, Easter, Christmas cakes, panettone, hot-cross buns, Sunday pagan temple worship as pagan concepts. The serpent with its tail in its mouth is the Ouroboros, which represents eternal rebirth, or transhumanist resurrection, a reference to the Luciferian pursuit of eternal life via an alternative means than bodily transformation through belief in Jesus Christ. Anthroposophical Society Author L. Frank Baum ( Wonderful Wizard of Oz ) was in the Theosophical Society . Close friends J.R.R. Tolkein ( Lord of the Rings ) and C.S. Lewis ( The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe ) were HOGD members. In his autobiography, C.S. Lewis credited his enduring ‘passion for the occult’ to a school mistress who introduced him to the ‘Anglo-American Occultist tradition’ based on ‘Theosophy, Rosicrucianism, Spiritualism.’ Lewis and Tolkien were in the Oxford reading group ‘The Inklings’ with HOGD member Charles Williams. The Oxford Inklings, including C.S. Lewis and J.R.R Tolkien, were influenced by German Luciferian Rudolf Steiner who created a Theosophical Society offshoot, the Anthroposophical Society . Senior Nazi Rudolph Hess strongly supported Rudolf Steiner whose writings reflect his eugenicist philosophy: If the blondes and blue-eyed people die out, the human race will become increasingly dense... Blonde hair actually bestows intelligence. 229 The Anthroposophical Society became the fastest growing cult in post -war Germany. 230 Anthroposophy means ‘human wisdom.’ Rudolph Steiner created counter - cultural movements within architecture, farming (biodynamics), and education.

Ordo Templi Orientis 231 Emma Hardinge Britten and Aleister Crowley helped found Thelema and the OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis, aka, Hermetic Brotherhood of Light , or Order of the Temple of the East , or Order of Oriental Templars ). The Ordo Templi Orientis was established in 1895, in part as a Western interpretation of certain Oriental occult teachings , and in part as a restoration of a tradition which had been largely forgotten in the West. Its original members were Freemasons , and in 1902 the authority of a Masonic Rite was conferred upon them for the establishment of a Grand Lodge in Berlin within which the Grades of the O.T.O. would be worked. The Founders of that Grand Lodge were Carl Kellner, Franz Hartmann and Heinrich Klein. The Grand Lodge was formally constituted on January 22nd, 1906, and this constitution was revised on January 22nd, 1917. National Grand Lodges were established for Germany (including Germany, Austria and Switzerland), and later for France (1908), the Slavonic Count ries (1912) and Great Britain (1912). Amongst the eminent figures who were, at one time, associated with the work of the Order were Gerard Encausse (‘ Papus ’), Dr Rudolf Steiner , and Dr R.W. Felkin. Following the death of the first Outer Head of the Order, Carl Kellner, in 1905, Theodor Reuss became the second Outer Head. During his period in office there was a rapid, and not altogether properly administered, expansion in the Order. It was Reuss who, in 1911, admitted Aleister Crowley to the Order and, in 1 912, appointed him head of the Order for Great Britain. Crowley effectively took over the pre -existing traditions of the Order and shaped them to suit his own interests. .. Crowley revised and rewrote the rituals of the Order, and his work attracted considerable notoriety. It is from the Crowleyan version of the Order that virtually all modern claimants to the title, tradition or working of the Order come, and to which virtually all who write about the Order refer. Huxley’s ‘60s Counterculture Through the Hofjuden, the British Royals assassinated or deposed every world leader who threatened their agenda.

The Rothschild family and their New York Jewish banking cousins, the Lehmans, established themselves in the USA via the pre -Civil War cotton and slave trade. These families supported Britain’s successful efforts to recapture the USA which they lost during the Confederate War, via the drug/rock counterculture. Counterculture litera lly meant ‘anti- culture’ - the intentional destruction of the existing Judeo-Christian culture and replacing it with Luciferian culture. British Intelligence officer Aldous Huxley coordinated the 1960s drug- rock counterculture including the introduction of psychedelics to the USA . Aldous Huxley moved to the USA in 1937 and remained there for WW2. Aldous and pedophile Christopher Isherwood were employed as Hollywood script writers for Warner Brothers, MGM, and Walt Disney studios. During the late 1930s to 1940s, Huxley and Isherwood laid the foundation for the 1960s drug -rock counterculture by recruiting people into the Isis Cults that Huxley’s mentors (Bulwer -Lytton, Blavatsky, and Crowley) had formed while stationed in India. Huxley founded multiple Isis Cults in southern California and the San Francisco area, while Isherwood translated and propagated ancient Zen Buddhist documents that inspired Zen-mystical cults. The 1960s counterculture was a complete resurrection of the Isis and Dionysian cults. The MK -ULTRA puppeteers rebranded the Isis Cross as the famous peace symbol of the ‘60s counterculture. The 1960s hippies played Dionysian Cult instruments including ‘Pan’ pipes, tambourines and skin drums. The Rite of Isis incantations, drum beating, dances, repetitive movements (like throwing the head back), and hallucinatory substances including mescal and hashish, created the dissociative trance state combined with hallucinations considered to be the visitation of the gods (spiritual possession). Hippies thought they were ‘becoming one’ with the goddess Mother Earth. Ancient cult drugs were sacred and their knowledge, preparation and gathering were secret. The Isis drug and dance ritual were reproduced at ‘60s CIA events like Woodstock. The sex orgies of the Isis Cult became the ‘free love ’ hippie orgies of the ‘sexual revolution.’ Both involved liberation from civilization's rules and constraints and featured a return to primordial nature Mother Earth and animalistic sexual behaviour. The ancient cults featured sex with animals. In 1952, Aldous Huxley accompanied his family doctor, Humphrey Osmond, to the USA. Huxley recruited Osmond to conduct research for CIA Director Allen Dulles’ MK -ULTRA covert LSD expe riment. Osmond wrote Schizophrenia: A New Approach in which he said mescaline (used in ancient Egyptian and Indian pagan rituals) produced a psychotic state identical in all clinical respects to schizophrenia, and so experimentation with hallucinogenic drugs may be key to developing a cure. In his book ‘ The Doors of Perception’ Huxley claimed hallucinogenic drugs ‘expand consciousness.’ In California, Huxley recruited to MK-ULTRA individuals who were initially attracted to the Isis Cults he founded during his previous USA visit, including Alan Watts and anthropologist Gregory Bateson (Margaret Mead’s husband). Watts became a nationwide Zen Buddhist cult guru who founded the Pacifica Foundation , a CIA cut-out which sponsored two radio stations used to introd uce the ‘Liverpool Sound’ to the USA, namely Rolling Stones,"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 197 Animals, and The Beatles, followed by ‘acid rock’ and fascist ‘punk rock.’ The Beatles, who featured Aleister Crowley on their album cover, took copious drugs and consulted their Indian guru, and so recruited a generation of youth to Huxley’s Dionysiac counterculture. Gregory Bateson became the director of a MK-ULTRA LSD experiment at Palo Alto VA Hospital in which patients were brainwashed into becoming ‘psychedelic’ Isis Cult hippies. One patient, Ken Kesey, completed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest three years after he was subjected to Bateson’s LSD experiments. Kesey then assembled a group who administered LSD to unsuspecting victims lured to the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco via Scott McKenzie’s counterculture song, ‘San Francisco.’ Huxley and Bateson established a ‘free clinic’ in the area to treat the subsequent addicts. This clinic paralleled a project at the Tavistock Institute, the psychological warfare agency for British Secret Intelligence. In 1960, Aldous Huxley gathered a Harvard LSD team comprised of Humphrey Osmond, Alan Watts, Timothy Leary, and Richard Alpert. Timothy Leary wrote The Psychedelic Experience based on the Ancient Tibetan Book of the Dead, to promote LSD as ‘ consciousness expanding.’ Aldous Huxley founding the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California, in 1962 via Stanford graduates Michael Murphy and Dick Price, to explore what Aldous called ‘human potentialities’ (i.e., human consciousness). Esalen became headquarters of Huxley’s counterculture movement, and led the New Age movement, Humanistic Psychology, and Gestalt Psychotherapy. Esalen teachers included Aldous Huxley, Arnold Toynbee, Timothy Leary, Carl Rogers, B.F. Skinner, Joan Baez, Ken Kesey, John C. Lilly, Rollo May, Abraham Maslow, Erik Erikson, and Deepak Chopra. Fritz Perls was an Esalen resident scholar for five years. In its early days, the Esalen facility was guarded by a gun-wielding Hunter S. Thompson who belonged to a child pornogra phy ring linked to Bohemian Grove during the 1980s. Thompson was offered $100,000 to make child porn snuff films during Luciferian rituals at Bohemian Grove. 232 CIA Cult Cut-Outs The CIA began using cult cut-outs to conceal their MK -ULTRA mind control activities, from 1963 onwards. The CIA started new cults or infiltrated existing cults as part of their Occultism in High Places project. 233 The CIA developed numerous cults during the 1960s hippie movement centred in California. The CIA’s use of cults for social control experimentation resulted in famous group murders and mass suicides. Ordo Templi Orientis OTO Agape Lodge in Pasadena, CA was founded by Satanist Jack Parsons, the rocket scientist who worked with Nazi Von Braun, and who co-design ed the Pentagon’s occultic shape. Aleister Crowley highly influenced Parsons to become high priest in this, the USA’s first OTO lodge. 232 John DeCamp (1992). The Franklin Cover- up . AWT. 233 Miles Copeland (1989). The Game Player .

In 1973, Louis Tackwood told journalist Donald Freed the OTA were a ‘devil - worshipping cult’ and on the LA Police Department payroll. Solar Lodge of the OTO (aka Riverside Lodge of the OTO ) in San Bernardino, CA, was linked to drug trafficking, blood drinking, child rape and murder. Founding lodge members were found guilty of the ‘Boy in the Box’ case featuring a six-year-old boy chained for 56 hot summer days in a shipping container in the desert. 234 Charles Manson, who slaughtered pedophile Roman Polanski’s wife Sharon Tate, belonged to this OTO lodge. Order of the Solar Temple (OTS) mixed Thelema, Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry, Ufology, and New Age philosophy. The OTS established lodges internationally including in Australia and Canada. The Lodges featured altars, rituals and robes. In October 1994, a three - month-old baby was stabbed to death with a stake at the Quebec OTS lodge. Immediately following this, 15 leaders ‘suicided’ with poison and 38 members were murdered by various means at OTS lodges in Switzerland. In December 1995, 15 people were found dead in the French OTS lodge. In March 1997, five OTS members were found dead in Quebec, while two children of one of the dead couples were found heavily drugged. Jonestown . The OTS mass deaths mimicked the assassinations the CIA conducted to cover up their Jonestown MK-ULTRA experiment. The Jonestown experiment was conceived, staffed and financed by Lawrence Laird Layton (University of California lecturer, former Manhattan Project chemist, and early 1950s head of the Army’s chemical warfare research division). His son Larry Layton led the Jonestown death squad that murdered Congressman Leo Ryan who was in Guyana to investigate the CIA’s formation of cults. Waco . Jonestown was a step toward the massive 1993 psychological operation known as Waco, Texas. The US government ’s torture and assassination of innocent women and children began by shooting dead a blonde preschool boy sent to the front door waving a white surrender flag. Victims were mass subjected to sleep deprivation via flood lighting, plus amplified loops of screeching rabbits and Nancy Sinatra threatening ‘ these boots are gonna walk all over you! ’ FBI agents (Bush Senior’s former bodyguards) were filmed being executed by their own men during the exercise. Waco husbands and fathers who rushed home from work and tried to enter the compound were shot dead climbing the fence. Finally, the government blocked all compound exits with flame -throwing tanks that incinerated and flattened the children they were supposedly there to rescue . The US public swallowed the official explanation that these crimes against humanity were committed to rescue abused cult victims. Scientology Before founding Scientology, L.

From some of his experiences I deduce he is direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel. He is the most Thelemic person I have ever met and is in complete accord with our own principles. He is also interested in establishing the New Aeon, but for cogent reasons I have not introduced him to the Lodge. L. Ron Hubbard based Scientology on Aleister Crowley’s black magic: The one super -secret sentence that Scientology is built on is: ‘Do as thou wilt. That is the whole of the law.’ It also comes from the black magic, from Aleister Crowley. It means that you are a law unto yourself, that you are above the law, that you create your own law. You are above any other human considerations. Capt. L. Ron Hubbard had links to the Office of Naval Intelligence , and MK -ULTRA. Hubbard participated in CIA drug experiments at St. Elizabeth’ s in Washington DC. Miles Copeland (CIA Case Officer ) said CIA operative Bob Mandelstam used Scientology as a front for his covert Occultism in High Places scheme. 235 The Orange People sex cult was based on Tantra, Taoism and Hinduism. Led by Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the CIA-created cult established a large following in Australia before moving the operation to Oregon. In 1985 the Portland Oregonian published a 36 -part, book -length series linking the cult to opium trafficking, prostitution, money laundering, arson, slave labour, mass poisonings, illegal wiretaps and the stockpiling of guns and biochemical warfare weapons . The year -long Oregonian investigation revealed cult ties to CIA-trained mercenaries in El Salvador and the Far East. Domestically, Rajneesh’s secret police force worked with Agency operatives. 236 The Family International (Children of God ) was CIA created in 1968 . The pedophile cult produced comic books instructions for ‘flirty fishing’ – i.e., child rape. Cult parents were encouraged to have sex with their own children.

Irrefutable evidence of its existence sits in the US Library of Congress in a document titled: Project MKULTRA, the CIA‘s Program of Research in Behavioral Modification, Joint Hearing Before the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Committee on Human Resources United States Senate Ninety-Fifth Congress First Session, August 3, 1977. According to this document, MK-ULTRA was an umbrella project for CIA-funded subprojects conducted in respected government and private institutions. Experiments conducted at universities, hospitals, prisons, and research facilities used drugs, hypnosis, electric shock, psychology, psychiatry, radiation, harassment substances, and paramilitary devices and materials, to manipulate human behaviour. The committee hearing was a whitewash. MK-ULTRA was far more sinister than the public were told. The following facts remain hidden from public understanding: • Doctors and scientists, including the pioneers of psychology and psychiatry, routinely tortured, raped, and murdered children whom the CIA kidnapped and trafficked for Project MK -ULTRA. • In the early 1970s, Australia became the main child recruitment location after Project MK-ULTRA’s US operation was publicly exposed. • The Australian and US military and Intelligence services collaborated to train Australian DELTA child soldiers for special operations. Evidence MK-ULTRA used Children Evidence that MK -ULTRA doctors experimented on children is sparse. Here are three documented case s: 1. Robbers Cave Experiment In 1953, Muzafer Sherif (a suspected Communist) conducted his initial MK -ULTRA experiment at Middle Grove in upstate New York, with Rockefeller Foundation funding. 237 Sherif recruited underprivileged 11-year-old boys from poor families with offers of a free summer camp. He deceived the parents and did not inform them or their children they were being used as subjects for a psychological experiment. The aim of the experiment was to 237 David Shariatmadari (2018).

Sherif’s theory was that we are shaped by the group that were members of, and if you change the way groups operate, you can alter the way people feel and behave. Sherif pitted two peaceful groups of children against each other and used sabotage and provocation to incite the boys to turn on each other . His first experiment failed. His second, successful experiment was conducted in 1954 at Robbers Cave in Oklahoma using boys selected based on observations of their school playground behaviour. The subjects were divided into two groups: rebellious types versus placid types who prayed. The latter group were traumatised by the unbridled behaviour of the rebellious group. The subjects were not debriefed afterwards, and some were seemingly permanently detrimentally impacted. 2. Martin Orne & John Gittinger Named to Presidential Committee The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments was established in 1994 to investigate the US government ’s unethical human radiation experiments. On March 15, 1995, New Orleans trauma therapist Valerie B. Wolf and her clients, Claudia S. Mullen and Chris deNicola Ebner appeared before the Advisory Committee in Washington, D.C. to testify on the connection between the Radiation Experiments and Mind Control Experimentation on Children. Wolf submitted: Generally, it appears that therapists across the co untry are finding clients who have been subjected to mind control techniques. The consistency of their stories about the purpose of the mind control and torture techniques, such as electric shock, use of hallucinogens, sensory deprivation, spinning, hypnos is , dislocation of limbs and sexual abuse is remarkable. There is almost nothing published on this aspect of mind control used with children, and these clients come from all over the country, having had no contact with each other ... It needs to be made clear that people have remembered these names and events spontaneously with free recall and without the use of any memory-retrievable techniques, such as hypnosis. Claudia S. Mullen testified: Between the years of 1957 and 1984, I became a pawn in a government scheme whose ultimate goal was mind control and to create the ‘perfect spy’ — all through the use of chemicals, radiation, drugs, hypnosis, electric shock, isolation in tubs of water, slee p deprivation, brainwashing and verbal, physical, emotional and sexual abuse. In 1958, I was to be tested, they told me, by some important doctors coming from a place called the ‘ Society’ (the Human Ecology Society ). [Human Ecology Fund] ... A Dr John Gittinger tested me, and Dr [Ewan] Cameron gave me the shocks and Dr Greene the x-rays. Then, I was told by Sid Gottlieb I was ‘ripe for the big A, ’ meaning ‘Artichoke.’ ... The next year, I was sent to a place in Maryland called Deep Creek Cabins to learn how to ‘sexually please men.’ Also, I was taught how to coerce them into talking about themselves.

Another time, I heard Dr Martin Orne , who was the Director of the Scientific Office, and later the Institute for Experimental Research, state that in order to keep more funding coming from different sources for the radiation and mind control projects, he suggested stepping up the amounts of all the ‘stressors’ used and also the blackmail portion of the experiments.

Joseph Mengele & Ewan Cameron Killed Kids in Catholic Montreal In 1997, Quebec Ombudsman Daniel Jacoby reported on his findings regarding the Duplessis Orphans. 238 His report glossed over multiple witness accounts of orphans being subjected to MK-ULTRA atrocities. In 1944, Quebec Premiere Maurice Duplessis, President Franklin Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, MacKenzie King, and CIA Director Allen Dulles reportedly attended a Quebec Conference to finalise a secret agreement where Quebec’s Catholic Orphanage children were given to the British and US military to be used as MK-ULTRA lab rats. Approximately 22,000 orphans were automatically certified mentally ill, to qualify them as subjects for MK-ULTRA research involving electrocution, lobotomy, rape, Deep -Slee p, LSD and other drug experiments at psychiatric facilities including Ewan Cameron’s Allan Memorial Institute , Saint Michel Archange Hospital and St Jean de Dieu .

Concordia University’s student newspaper explains: 240 During his time in power from the mid-1930s to the late 1950s (with one break where the Liberals re -took power), Duplessis transferred power to the Church by extending their responsibilities to include operation of most social services like orphanages. This gave the Church authorization to act as a government -sponsored agency—minus any form of public accountability. At the time, federal funding allocated $0.70 to $1.25 per day, per orphan to the church. If an orphan was mentally disabled, they received $2.50 in subsidies. This precipitated a mass scale process of proliferating ‘orphans ’ and intentionally misdiagnosing them as mentally disabled to qualify for the larger subsidy. In many instances, the children recruited weren’t legitimately orphaned. Nuns and priests would travel to low-income neighborhoods throughout Quebec and Eastern US and convince parents to hand over their children, promising them a better future. Bernard Piché, a doctor who falsely certified the orphans as mentally disabled, admitted to not examining any children in 1999. In a statement, Piché said, ‘I did it because the nuns asked me to.’ ... The matching testimonies of the Duplessis orphans being tortured with electro -shock therapy, forcible injections with powerful drugs and other human experimentation raises serious concern that this tragedy was part of MK Ultra —a US government program which honed torture techniques and had a known human -experimentation centre in McGill University. Sylvio Albert Day, a Duplessis Orphan, says that one of the priests was Joseph Mengle , a former Nazi doctor during World War II. Day’s job was to transport dead bodies into unmarked graves. Some of these bodies had to be cleaned because in 1942 Quebec law allowed nuns to sell unclaimed bodies to medical schools for $10. At St Jean de Dieu hospital, Sylvio Day transported approximately 70 dead bodies in three months. That equates to Joseph Mengele and his MK-ULTRA doctors murdering one child per w orkday in a single hospital. Sylvio said the children were as young as 4, their skulls often had holes drilled into the m, and one had its brain removed . Bodies not sold to medical schools were placed in cardboard boxes and stacked in mass graves in the ‘p igsty’ cemetery. 239 http://lunamoth1.blogspot.com/2011/06/dr -mengele -comes- to-quebec -1949.html 240 Lou Teeluck (2018).

It is child’s play now to develop a multiple personality through hypnotism . 246 Martin Orne’s presentation paper was later titled ‘ Antisocial Behavior and Hypnosis .’ His experimental objective was to see if hypnotised subjects would carry out dangerous and harmful acts they normally would not. The resultant article, Social Control in the Psychological Experiment: Antisocial Behaviour & Hypnosis, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , was co-authored by Martin Orne and University of Sydney psychology student Frederick J .

Sheehan and Campbell W . Perry conducted Manchurian-candidate hypnosis experiments with this Pennsylvanian research network. Campbell Perry became a board member of the CIA’s False Memory Syndrome Foundation headed by Martin Orne. Wendy A. Fairfax-Thorn was a student in Phil Sutcliffe’s Psychology department, studying hypnosis and multiple personality disorder with Subproject 84 psychologist Frederick J. Evans. In 1960, Wendy Thorn completed a University of Sydney thesis on posthypnotic amnesia, then presented her paper Hypnosis and Suggestibility to the ABBPS. In 1961, the ABBPS financed a post-graduate research scholarship to ANU (Australian National University) for Wendy Thorn to study the placebo effect. Her resultant 1962 ANU thesis noted: ‘This study would have also lacked a great deal without the information, advice and materials supplied by Professor H .J. Eysenck (director of MK -ULTRA Subproject 111). 249 From 1963 to 1964, Wendy Thorn participated in hypnosis research with Frederick J. Evans while receiving assistance from the CIA -funded Studies in Hypnosis Project directed by Martin Orne. In 1963, Fred Evans attended Harvard on a Fulbright Scholarship to work and publish with Martin Orne. 250 Wendy Thorn later collaborated with Fred Evans and Hans Eysenck on MK -ULTRA research at Maudsley Hospital Institute of Psychiatry (IoP) in London. 251 252 Wendy Thorn and Fred Evans subsequently co-published a paper on hypnotic amnesia in 1966. 253 Phillip Sutcliffe had MK-ULTRA connections which led to Martin Orne commencing his MK-ULTRA hypnosis research at the University of Sydney . Peter Sheehan explained: Phil had network connections with Martin Orne, and very quickly I got drawn into a very extensive program of research – that was funded in Australia – and then through the network and the associations and working with Phil Sutcliffe, I then went across to work with Martin Orne in Philadelphia. Phil Sutcliffe was influence d by his thesis examiner Hans Eysenck who directed MK - ULTRA Subproject 111. 254 In 1959, Phil Sutcliffe received the first University of Sydney PhD for his thesis Hypnotic Behaviour: Fantasy or Simulation?

The examiners declared Sutcliffe’s work ‘a model for what a PhD thesis should be.’ Robert White headed Harvard’s Social Relations Department where MK -ULTRA doctors Henry A. Murray and Timothy Leary operated. After examining Phil Sutcliffe’s thesis in November 1959, Hans Eysenck applied for a CIA grant to direct MK-ULTRA Subproject 111. The CIA Chemical Branch Chief concluded, ‘Eysenck is one of the most skilful and productive psychologists on the international scene today and a grant to him would add prestige of the Society.’ 255 Peter Van Sommers . Phil Sutcliffe later connected with Peter Van Sommers, a University of Melbourne student who received a 1958 Fulbright Scholarship to become the first student in Experimental Psychology at Harvard’s Social Relations Department . 256 At Harvard, Van Sommers placed electrodes in the brains of rats to create lesions used to control their behaviour. Harvard retained Van Sommers until 1961, after his Fulbright scholarship expired, because his research was valuable to DoD (Department of Defence) projects. Van Sommers also spent time at the University of Pennsylvania which offered the world’s most cutting-edge psychology research laboratory. In the late 1960s, Van Sommers visited the Mecca of MK -ULTRA, Aldous Huxley’s Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California. University of Sydney: Australian Occult & MK-ULTRA Epicentre During the 1950s, ‘60s, and ‘70s, most leading universities in Australia (including Sydney, Western Australia, Melbourne, and Canberra’s ANU) had staff and students in the MK-ULTRA network. The University of Sydney remained the epicentre of MK -ULTRA in Australia. My key MK-ULTRA perpetrators attended the University of Sydney. Harry Bailey graduated medicine in 1954. Leonas Petrauskas graduated with a diploma in Tropical Medicine in 1957 while Antony Kidman studied there . Kidman and Telford Conlon completed second year Chemistry together in December 1959, the same year Conlon’s future wife Patricia Anne Carden passed third year English. John Manning Ward was History professor (1948-1979) while Anne was a history major, and Rosalind Croucher studied law in the 1970s. Ward became Vice -Chancellor (1981-1990). Holsworthy anaesthetist Colonel John Overton (Antony Kidman’s next-door neighbour) graduated medicine in 1962 with heart transplant surgeon Victor Chang. Actor John Bell graduated from Sydney University in 1962. My key perpetrators belonged to multiple secret societies including the Freemasons, Jesuits, Rosicrucians, Theosophical Society, the OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis), and self-styled esoteric groups. The various organisations were intertwined. Senior Australian Freemasons are closely tied to the international heads of Rosicrucianism. The OTO incorporate Jesuit teachings.

Blavatsky incorporated Buddhist Shambhala mythology into her occultic society and claimed to be in contact with a Great White Lodge / Brotherhood of Himalayan ‘Masters’ , a group of highly developed humans. ‘Master Morya’ is described as a man ‘living on the earth but possessed of developed senses that laughed at time and space.’ OTO members are designated a number preceded by the title of ‘Frater’ which means fraternity brother of the ‘Great White Brotherhood.’ Australia’s OTO Headquarters proudly advertised the following address - until my Candy Girl documentary was released: PO Box 362 Wentworth Building The University of Sydney NSW 2006 The Wentworth Building also contains the university of Sydney University’s student services, student union, medical centre, banks, hairdresser, and shops. Gregory Tillet published the following on the University of Sydney OTO website: The History of the O TO in Australia The original, pre -Crowleyan Order had, however, been brought to Australia around 1908 by Vyvyan Deacon, who became the first Grand Master for the Order in Australia, having received his authority from the Outer Head, Theodor Reuss. Deacon (Frater Memnon) established the Order in Sydney and Melbourne and, during a visit to New Zealand in 1920-2l, attempted to lay the foundations of the Order there. Between 1914, when the active work of the Order in Australia commenced, and 1930, when Deacon returned to-London, the Order attracted, and influenced, a number of eminent Australians. Notable amongst them were several involved in the arts and literature. The Order became dormant after the departure of its Grand Master, who died in London in 1938; his archives, authorities and regalia (such of it as survived the Blitz) were entrusted to his daughter's guardianship until a successor could be appointed. Forty-four years later the guardianship was relinquished, and the authority and symbols of office were passed to Frater Memnon's successor. Frater Iacchos who, upon his appointment issued a decree, ‘Of The True Secret of The O.·.T.·.O.·.,’ in which he re - affirmed the original, pre -Crowleyan traditions and working of the Order. The O.·.T.·.O.·. in Australia works the traditions of the Order established by its founders, revised only insofar as has been necessary to remove later accretions. The Crowleyan Order was established in Australia in the 1920's by Frank Bennett (‘Frater Progradior’) who had been trained by Crow ley as a missionary to Australia."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" 208 His work attracted a degree of hostile publicity but failed to achieve any real influence.

The ABC is linked to the BBC which covered up the Luciferian pedophile crimes of Jimmy Savile. In 2015, British Intelligence agent Paul Barry mocked and slandered me on national television after I publicly spoke about my experience of gover nment child sex trafficking which implicated the University of Sydney OTO. The OTO International Handbook contains specific instruction not to publicly perform ritual animal sacrifice: Don’t sacrifice animals or perform any other actions or practices which might adversely affect the Order’s reputation or legal standing, including public performance of the Mass of the Phoenix, Liber Jugorum, or explicit sexual acts at official or public -access events. My perpetrators were members of the University of Sydney OTO. Nicole Kidman and I witnessed her father Antony Kidman perform an OTO ritual murder of a five-year-old boy in the University of Sydney Great Hall. The ritual reflected Aleister Crowley’s quote: For the highest spiritual working one mu st accordingly choose that victim which contains the greatest and purest force, a male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory and suitable victim... But the bloody sacrifice, though more dangerous, is more efficacious; and for nearly all purposes human sacrifice is the best . Alf Conlon University of Sydney Philosophy Professor John Anderson influenced psychiatrist Alfred Austin Justin Conlon and his ‘small but persuasive group’ of Australian intellectuals called the Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs (DORCA). 258 In 1939, Conlon was a 32-year- old medical student at the University of Sydney, and an elected member of the university Senate. When war broke out, Conlon became the university's Manpower Officer, which 257 Ordo Templi Orientis (2002).

As Manpower Officer, Conlon’s expressed goal was to save Australia’s intellectual cream from becoming cannon fodder for the British Empire. In 1942, Conlon convinced Brigadier Victor Stantke (Army Education Director) that the Army needed its own special research section. With zero military training or experience, Conlon became an Army Colonel. Conlon persuaded Prime Minister John Curtin to form, and appoint Conlon Chair of, the Prime Minister's Committee on National Morale. Conlon then convinced General Thomas Blamey (Commander-in-chief of the Australian Military Forces) that the research section should be upgraded to a directorate which advised on the civil government of Australian territories, particularly P apua New Guinea. The result was DORCA. The PNG campaigns (1944 – 1945) are partly attributed to General Blamey and PM Curtin falling under DORCA influence . DORCA was staffed by University of Sydney employees and graduates who were heavily involved in the occult, associated with intelligence groups ASIO and CIA, had communist connections, and demonstrated massive international influence. Conlon assembled the following DORCA (later ASOPA ) team: - Camilla Wedgwood (English anthropologist, DORCA lecturer). - Margaret Mead (American cultural anthropologist, married MK -ULTRA anthropologist Gregory Bateson). - William E.H. Stanner (anthropologist, ANU lecturer, Aboriginal rights activist, advisor to my pedophile rapist PM Gough Whitlam). - Julius Stone (lawyer). - James Plimsoll (banker, later head of External Affairs, Governor of Tasmania, Australian UN representative). - James McAuley (DORCA lecturer, CIA/ASIO agent, poet, founding member of occultic Liberal Catholic Church). - Harold ‘Hal’ Stewart (poet, Shin Buddhist, homosexual). - Ida Leeson (Mitchell Librarian, member of Theosophical Society and Rudolph Steiner’s Anthroposophical Society, Marxist lesbian feminist activist, pushed for a totalitarian New World Order). - Peter A Ryan (journalist, WWII spy in PNG). - J.

Conlon, Kerr, Ryan, Stewart, Hogbin, Plimsoll, and McAuley all graduated Fort Street High School, a selective school for intellectually gifted students located next door to the University of Sydney. Other DORCA staff graduated from alternative selective schools like Sydney Boys High. This is relevant to Conlon’s hidden eugenicist agenda, indicated in this tribute : Alf Conlon (1908 –61) was a visionary. He would not have known it, but his ideology had similarities with the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci . Conlon had a belief that the ideas that shape society come from a fairly small elite united by shared intellectual premises, and he sought to use the chaos of the war to establish a new kind of elite in Australia. What Gramsci termed ‘organic intellectua ls’ Conlon thought of as his intellectual underground . When the war had begun to pose a direct threat to Australia, he could see that the fallout was going to destroy the credibility of the existing elites and undermine the derived power of the conventional establishment. He recognised the possibility of using the chaos to build a new power group with progressive ideas, organic to Australian society and based on intellect . No Marxist, Conlon insisted his ‘New Men’ would be a classless elite , yet those he had in mind were lower -middle -class boys like himself who had come to university through the selective State school system . The poet James McAuley was typical of Conlon’s incipient elite: brainy, ambitious, contemptuous and, most importantly, a product of Co nlon’s alma mater, Fort Street Boys High, Sydney, as were Hal Stewart, Ian Hogbin, Jim Plimsoll and a brilliant law graduate named John Kerr. 259 The Manor ASOPA’s Sydney headquarters were located directly next door to The Manor at 2 Iluka Road, Clifton Gardens, Mosman. The Manor is a 30-room mansion which contains an Egyptian temple. The Theosophical Society rented The Manor in 1922, purchased it in 1925, and in 1951 created The Manor Foundation Ltd to own and administer the property. In a 1983 court case, occupants of The Manor claimed to practise a religion there for the purposes of tax exemption status, and supplied the following examples of rituals conducted there : ‘...there was also a number of specific spiritual and educat ional disciplines to which they were expected to subject themselves. These involved attendance at a service of the Holy Eucharist which was a religious ceremony of the Liberal Catholic Church, somewhat similar to a communion service in the Anglican Church. This was held in the 259 Cassandra Pybus (2012). Conlon’s Remarkable Circus , in S cholars at War: A ustralian Social Scientists, 1939 - 1945.

There was also held each morning in the temple a short service of the Egyptian rite , which is the Theosophical ceremony of invocation... A solemn benediction service, also a service of the Liberal Catholic Church, took place every Monday night in the Chapel. Also on Monday nights a further Egyptian rite service was held in the Temple .’ National Archive documents reveal ASIO suspected the Theosophical Society headquarters were a major Communist hub where Soviet spies gathered to plan their infiltration of Australia. Leaders of the Theosophical Society, Freemasons, Rosicrucians, and Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) met at The Manor to plan their cultural takeover of Australia via the University of Sydney which house d the national OTO headquarters. Camilla Wedgewood’s cousin, James I. Wedgwood, a Theosophist and Freemason, established the OTO in Australia. Theosophy Legacy During the 1920s, the Theosophical Society had about 7,000 members in the USA, 2,500 in Australia, and 20,000 in India. Theosophy was closely linked to the Indian independence movement , the Indian National Congress, whose most famous leader and revolutionary, Mahatma Gandhi, became associated with and influenced by Theosophy while studying law in London (1888 to 1890). Gandhi attended Theosophical Society meetings and met with Madame Blavatsky and Annie Besant. The Theosop hical Society took control of early Australia's social and political systems. Theosophy is based on the notion of Aryan superiority. The Theosophist Society members influenced our second Prime Minister Alfred Deacon to create the White Australia Policy. Alfred Deakin’ s daughter Ivy Deacon co-founded Australia's first Eugenics Society with the Australian Theosophical Society’s leader , and members of the Order of the Star in the East . Ivy Deacon’s son, Alfred Deakin Brooks, became the first head of ASIS ( Aust ralian Secret Intelligence Service ). The Theosophists and Co-Masons created Australia’s first abortion clinic, started our Eugenics movement, and controlled Australia’s Kindergarten Union who provided public childcare. Theosophist and Co-Mason Edith Cowan (who is on our $50 note) was the first Australian to advocate for forced sterilization and government removal of children from Australian citizens. Edith Cowan, who pushed to sexualize children, created Australia’s Child Protection Society and Children's Court, the two government organisations responsible for a massive child trafficking operation where children are still taken from innocent parents and handed to pedophile foster parents for sex trafficking . Walter Burley Griffin, who designed Australia’s capital city Canberra, belonged to the Anthroposophical Society , an elite version of the Theosophical Society . Canberra’s town plan is based on Freemasonic, occultic symbology and sacred geometry. 2GB Radio Pedophiles In 1926, the Theosophical Society founded one of Australia's first public broadcast radio stations, 2GB. They named 2GB after Hermetic occultist Giordano Bruno. Initially operating out of The Manor , 2GB promoted the Theosophical Society, Freemasonry, Eugenics, racism, and anti-Christian sentiment. 2GB broadcast the Sunday mass from the Liberal Catholic"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" 212 Church (LCC) , an occult group which met in a Redfern church building. The LCC was initiated by Cha rles W. Leadbeater and Camilla Wedgewood’s brother James Ingall Wedgwood . The LCC fused Freemasonry, Theosophy, and the OTO (who held their initial ritual in the LCC’s Redfern church). Leadbeater was a prominent Theosophist leader who trained under Madame Blavatsky, co-authored books with Annie Besant, and pursued, ‘a certain kind of meditation connected with the development of the mysterious power called kundalini.’ A notorious pedophile, Leadbeater served as headmaster at the English Buddhist Academy in Ceylon, and wrote numerous books on clairvoyance, the astral plane, and the chakras. Wesleyan evangelist Gordon Moyes became the conservative ‘Christian’ face of 2GB. I attended one of Moyes’ famous crusades in Tweed Heads when I was a teenager and well recall his façade of respectability, impeccable grooming, and neat navy suit. Moyes preached to my generation on whether teens should kiss. . . all the while gangraping children with fellow Freemasons. ‘ Big Tim, Little Tim’ documents Tim Roy’s experiences of ritual rape committed by multiple 2GB radio announcers including Gordon Moyes, who committed suicide while under police investigation; and Alan Jones, whose television appearances were momentarily suspended during police inquiry . In 1973, Alan Jones was forced to resign from his position as a teacher at The King’s School in Sydney for sexually grooming students. On one occasion, ‘one of the masters found a letter, written by Jones to a boy, that had been left behind in a classroom desk. In it, Alan spoke of thinking about the boy late at night, expressing his love.’ 260 Two of Alan Jones’ close associates were key members of Sydney ’s pedophile network, lawyer John Marsden, and underbelly cop Roger Rogerson. According to multiple reports, all 2GB celebrities were pedophile s, including financier John Singleton. Tim Roy’s father worked at Daruk and sex trafficked Daruk boys to entertainers. James McAuley Founding member of the Liberal Catholic Church, James McCauley was an Australian Academic, Marxist (later anti-communist) and CIA/ASIO asset. A famous Australian poet, McCauley dedicated his poem Winter Nightfall to his friend Camilla Wedgwood. McAuley used sarcasm to inform the public that the Luciferian Order was operating in Australia: A great number of the Australian university intellectuals who gravitated to Communism did so by an interesting path: The fact that many of us danced in diverse incoherent snatches instead of performing to the strict choreography of Stalin is not decisive. The eccentrics, the dissenters even from the orthodoxy of dissent, might re - explore Nietsche, or Stirner, or Sorel, or the anarchism lighted up by the Spanish Civil War (as I did – along with exploring the literary esoterisms of Blake, Mallarme, Rilke, George and so on).

In 1957, Kerr joined the executive board of the CIA’s anti-communist advocacy group, Association for Cultural Freedom . In 1964, Kerr and future NSW Premier Neville Wran helped defend the counterculture Oz magazine (a propaganda tool used by the British Round Table) when it was prosecuted for obscenity. PM Gough Whitlam appointed Kerr as Governor -General in 1974. Weaponised Anthropology via ASOPA ASOPA claimed their purpose was to police the Pacific Islands to expand Australia’s sphere of global influence, and to train teachers and administrators for Papua New Guinea (PNG). They were in fact studying native tribes for weaponised anthropology, a Marxist method for understanding culture in order to find the key to subverting and destroying it (i.e., to social engineer a replacement Luciferian culture ). ASOPA graduates attended field assignments in the Pacific Islands, including PNG and Manus Island, where they developed Australian colonies and conducted anthropological, medical, and anti-viral research connected to MK -NAOMI. Key anthropologists Camilla Wedgewood and Margaret Mead worked together at ASOPA. Margaret Mead A bisexual in later life, Hofjuden eugenicist Margaret Mead promoted the notion of sexual evolution throughout life . Mead pioneered Australia’s sexual revolution and promoted sexual activity amongst pre -teen Western children based on her false reports of witnessing PNG tribal children engaging in sexual intercourse. Mead was subsequently outed as one of the greatest academic frauds of the 20th Century (yet the University of Queensland’s Anthropology faculty celebrate her birthday). Mead was a member of the Society for Psychical Research , an occult group that consulted spirits. A MK -ULTRA operative, Mead was instrumental in the Stanford Research Institute ’s Changing Images of Man project. The Stanford University faculty committee planned the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) at the Bohemian Grove pedophile summer camp of 1939 an d established it in 1946. By 1965, most SRI projects were of a military and intelligence nature. Protesting Stanford students forced SRI to relocate off-campus in 1970. In 1968, the US Office of Education commissioned SRI to examine alternative future possibilities for the year 2000 and to derive policy implications for educating youth in ways more relevant to the NWO agenda. SRI reported which ‘changes in the conceptual premises underlying Western society would lead to a desirable future.’ SRI’s conclusions were published in a book called Changing Images of Man (1974). 262 A blueprint for a vast social engineering project, the book blatantly attacks Protestant Christianity. Its Introduction to Chapter 4 reads: At various times in history, man's image of himself was shaped by mythology, philosophy, and religion.

Camilla Wedgwood Zionist Camilla Wedgewood was of the Darwin -Galton-Huxley-Wedgwood dynasty. Her parents were first cousins. Camilla’s father Josiah Wedgwood was a British Labor politician, Army Colonel connected to Intelligence, and Zionist involved with the WW1 Jewish Legion and Mule Corp. Josiah was well involved with the Theosophical Society who published his book, The Future of the Indo-British Commonwealth , which promoted the creation of a NWO via universal Brotherhood, and determined Christianity is not the answer. The foreword by then Prime Minister of South Africa read: ‘The New World Order will be a world of individualism controlled by Britain and America.’ The SRI Changing Images of Man book parroted Josiah Wedgwood’s content. Camilla Wedgwood was into occultism, Freemasonry, and the Theosophical idea of a New World Order. She was a student of Rudolph Steiner, European spy, Freemason, member of the Order of the Illuminati, and OTO co-founder who claimed the ‘Luciferic Impulse’ manifested on Earth in 3000 BC. Camilla Wedgewood’s mother Ethel was in a sexual relationship with Luciferian Theosophist Rudolf Steiner and translated most of his writings. Camilla Wedgewood was a left-wing feminist who lectured at the University of Sydney. Appointed Principal of the university’s Women’s College in 1935, Wedgewood promoted Margaret Mead’s false reports of sexual activity between tribal PNG children as the basis of condoning sex between prepubescent Western children, and she used her academic position to encourage sexual promiscuity among young women . She tellingly said post-war social change was the result of the intersection of ‘the revolt of women and the revolt of youth.’ In 1944, Alf Conlon commissioned Camilla Wedgwood as Lieutenant Colonel in the Australian Army where she served as a DORCA research officer. Wedgewood served two field years in PNG, and as senior ASOPA lecturer in N ative Administration. Operation Matchbox Operation Matchbox was the codename for Australia’s version of Operation Paperclip. Under Matchbox, Britain secretly organised the recruitment and transfer of at least 127 German scientists and engineers (including 31 Nazi party members and six SS) to Australia between 1946 and 1951. 263 Matchbox remained top secret until a journalist accidentally uncovered the secret operation in the National Archives of Australia. Operation Matchbox transferred chemical and biological weapons experts to Australian Military laboratories. In 1948, Operation Paperclip recruited Erich Traub, head of the Nazi’s bioweapons projects. 264 Nazi bioweapons expert Vincent Zigas was recruited the same year. Vincent Zigas came from Estonia, a country which provided Nazi Germany with a National Legion during WWII. Vincent Zigas and Nazi physician Leonas ‘Leo’ Petrauskas (my 263 Ian Traynor (1999).

Traub’ as having passed their security check for employment eligibility in PNG. Petrauskas and Zigas completed a four -month ASOPA course taught by Camilla Wedgewood and James McAuley before travelling to PNG where they shared a house together. Vincent Zigas became close friends with James McAuley and the godfather of his son. Camilla Wedgewood introduced Leonas Petrauskas to Margaret Mead (wife of MK - ULTRA founder Gregory Bateson) on Manus Island in 1955. In the Preface of her 1956 book New Lives for Old, Margaret Mead thank ed ‘Leo’ Petrauskas for assisting her in PNG, but misspelt his surname ‘Petrausk is.’ 266 In 1960, Petrauskas followed up research into heart disease and influenza by Camilla’s nephew John Wedgwood. He also oversaw computer- based personality assessment at Saint Barts Hospital, London . Significantly, Leonas Petrauskas was involved with two Wedge woods plus Margaret Mead in the space of 10 years. While in PNG, Leonas Petrauskas wrote a study on the effects of poisoning by a Cone Fish sting on a child. 267 Petrauskas obtained a postgraduate qualification in Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney in 1957. I witnessed Leonas Petrauskas use the cover of a blue ringed octopus sting to account for the death of the young boy murdered and raped by necrophiliac Paul Ke ating at Kurnell Beach in Sydney. Leonas Petrauskas’ Occult Connections Leonas Petrauskas came from Lithuania, a country with a strong pagan history. He connected with the Theosophical Society shortly after arriving in Australia. All the new immigrant events that Leonas Petrauskas participated in were held at the Theosophical Society. Leonas was involved with the New Australians Cultural Association (NACA) an organisation formed to assist newly arrived European immigrants settle into Australian life. Adyar Hall, a frequent home to NACA events, was owned by the Theosophical Society. 268 Adyar Hall was also used by the pro -Nazi Rationalist Association, and the Australia First Movement led by P.R. Stephenson (Aleister Crowley’s associate). Leonas Petrauskas gave a talk for NACA at Adyar Hall in 1949. A previous NACA Vice-President was a leading member of the Theosophical Society . 269 Another NACA Vice-President was the grandson of a Prince initiated into Egyptian Freemasonry by Alessandro Cagliostro, an early occultist whom Aleister Crowley claimed to be an incarnation of.

Project MK-NAOMI in PNG MK-ULTRA was related to MK-NAOMI, a joint CIA/US Army chemical and biological weapons project based at Fort Detrick, Maryland, that ran from 1953 to 1970. The project involved, ‘developing, testing, and maintaining biological agents and delivery systems for use against humans as well as against animals and crops.’ MK-NAOMI received CIA funding through MK -ULTRA Subprojects 13, 30 and 50. 270 Daniel Carleton Gajdusek , an American physician, received the 1976 Nobel Prize for research on the PNG kuru disease. In 1957, Frank McFarland Bur net organised with Joseph Smadel of Fort Detrick to send military-trained Gajdusek to study the Kuru Virus Vincent Zigas discovered in PNG. 271 Joseph Smadel had conducted military virus research with his colleague Joshua Lederberg. 272 Frank McFarland Burnet employed Vincent Zigas to study the Kuru Virus in PNG and collect samples of it for Burnet’s Melbourne laboratory. 273 Gajdusek’s studies in PNG were financed by the US Army under a contract titled, ‘ Field Studies on the Control of Infectious Disease of Military Importance ,’ in connection with research at Fort Detrick. 274 Gajdusek sent samples of the virus to Smadel at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. 275 Smadel was at the centre of all US bioweapons research. Gajduse k, Zigas, and Petrauskas worked together in PNG in 1959. 276 Between 1955 and 1977 Zigas regularly joined Gajdusek at the National Institute of Health in Bethseda, USA. In 1957, Zigas met with Alex Sinclair , military psychologist and protégé of William Walters Sargant, the British end of MK -ULTRA. 277 Sinclair was sent to PNG to study the psychological effects of the Kuru Virus. 278 Sinclair later gave a speech, Forcible Indoctrination to the Papua New Guinea Scientific Society . Sinclair was involved with ECT (electroconvulsive ‘therapy’) and Deep Sleep Therapy brainwashing methods, and supported Sydney MK-ULTRA doctor Harry Bailey. 279 Alex Sinclair subsequently engaged in a Military Psychological Operation to influence PNG citize ns’ support of Australia’s presence in their country. 280 At Fort Detrick, Carleton Gajdusek transmitted a ‘kuru like syndrome’ into chimpanzees.

Gajdusek openly admitted to raping boys and approving of pedophilia. ‘He remained unrepentant about his sexual relationships with the young boys. He often said he thought American law was unduly prudish and argued that he had chosen boys only from cultures where man-boy sex was common and unremarkable.’ 286 Robert Gallo contributed $60,000 to Gajdusek’s bail. In 1970, Robert Gallo spoke to NATO scientists on how to create AIDS-like viruses. 287 CSIRO Bioweapons Development The Fulbright scheme was used to station bioweapons experts in Australia. Arthur Galston (who helped develop Agent Orange at Fort Detrick in the 1950s) received a 1960 Fulbright Scholarship to work with the CSIRO. 288 A 1956 Fulbright scholarship was given to Joshua Lederberg of Fort Detrick to study Clonal Selection Theory with Sir Gustav Nossal and Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet at the University of Melbourne. 289 Joshua Lederberg became key to bioweapons development after discovering bacteria can swap genes. His connection to Fort Detrick bioweapon research began in 1949. Joshua Lederberg received the 1958 Nobel Prize and moved to Stanford University. He became President of Rockefeller University, a member of the Defence Science Board and the mysterious JASON Group . Lederberg currently advises government on bioweapons and bioterrorism.

Ford Funded ASOPA During the Cold War, half of all Ford Foundation grants served the CIA. In 1963, Leonard Huxley brokered a deal with the Ford Foundation for $200,000 of funding to assist ASOPA. In 1964, Ford Foundation beneficiary Margaret Mead visited former ASOPA lecturer William E.H. Stanner at ANU where he headed the Research School which focussed on Pacific Studies. ANU: MK-ULTRA Research University Alf Conlon was instrumental in forming the Australian National University (ANU) which he intended to be a full research university . 302 According to the 1946 ANU Act, Conlon, 'Nugget' Coombs, Douglas 'Pansy' Wright and others planned the Canberra facility to ‘ provide facilities for postgraduate research and study both generally and in relation to subjects of national importance to Australia .’ ANU was to contain one medical research, one physical sciences, and two social science schools. These schools corresponded t o key CIA MK-ULTRA research interest areas, and Conlon’s goal of introducing a new sociology. ANU was part of Conlon’s plan to attract Australian physicist Marcus Oliphant (who helped develop the atomic bomb) and other Australian scientists back to Australia. Coombs arranged for Oliphant to meet Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley , when Chifley and his advisers were in London for the 1946 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' meeting. Oliphant became ANU Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences, and he encouraged his Birmingham scientists to follow.

The AAEC opening at Lucas Heights was attended by Herbert Coombs, Justice Michael Kirby, and Gough Whitlam. In 1987, the AAEC was renamed ANSTO ( Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ). The AAEC’s sister organisation was the CSIRO ( Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ). In 1981, parts of the AAEC were split off and joined to the CSIRO. Founded in 1949, the CSIRO is a federal government agency responsible for scientific research including genetic engineering, industrial chemistry, and radio astronomy. The CSIRO established a research laboratory (‘ National Standards Laboratory ’) at the University of Sydney in 1939 which had three divisions, Electrotechnology, Metrology and Physics. Richard Casey , ASIO & ASIS Richard Gardiner-Casey helped found the organisations involved in my child trafficking. His mother’s maiden name Gardiner was preserved due to the value place d on the Gardiner Illuminati bloodline . My father -in-law and his sisters are typically proud of their Gardiner heritage also. My father-in-law’s mother was a Gardiner and blood relative of Toni Gardiner (renamed ‘Muna’ ), the English mother of the current King Hussein of Jordan. At my husband’s annual Easter family gathering, those with Gardiner heritage (called ‘Innies’ ) sat together , while the ‘Outties’ were ostracised to a separate dining table. Richard Casey was crucial to the establishment of Australia’s Intelligence agencie s. 304 ASIO ( Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ) and ASIS ( Australian Secret Intelligence Service ). ASIO was modelled on MI5 and it functions like the FBI. ASIS is our external security force and comparable to MI6 and the CIA . Casey became Minister for External Affairs in 1951, the year of the military agreement between Australia and the USA. Casey met with MI5 at ASIO’s new Melbourne headquarters in 1952. He established ASIS that same year and had it report directly to his position. Casey appointed as ASIS head Alfred Deakin-Brookes, grandson of former PM Deakin, and son of his friend Herbert Brookes. Casey founded ASIS with the backing of MI6. The CIA later helped develop ASIS by providing equipment and officer training . ASIS remained tied to MI6 and joined its 1952 covert radio network. In September 1953, Richard Casey travelled to the USA and met with CIA Director Allen Dulles. Richard Casey held numerous influential positions: - WWI Army Major. - Elected MP in 1931 for anti-communist United Australia Party . - Australian Treasurer 1935 – 39. - Represented Australian PM to British Government (1924 – 1939). - First Australian ambassador to the USA (1940 – 42). - Heavily involved with the UN, from 1951. 304 Frank Cain (1994).

Casey’s War on Communism As Prime Minister Stanley Bruce ’s UK representative (1924-39), Richard Casey received information from MI5 regarding members of the Communist Party of Australia (CPA) travelling to Soviet Russia. This served as the impetus for the formation of ASIS and redevelopment of ASIO. Casey also developed long-term contacts with US Intelligence organisations. Churchill subsequently stationed Casey as an intelligence operative in Cairo (1942) and Bengal (1944). Upon returning to Australia, Casey became President of the conservative Liberal Party and set about infiltrating the CPA. He associated closely with ASIO Director-General Col. Spry, bypassing the Attorney -General ministry responsible for ASIO. Casey likely influenced Spry’s decision to recruit anti-Communist university graduates to ASIO, including Michael Thwaites (Oxford Rhodes Scholar, WWII Naval Officer , a Qld Premiere’s grandson). AACF In 1950, the CIA established the US Congress for Cultural Freedom to combat communism and Soviet propaganda. Its Australian branch was called the Australian Association for Cultural Freedom (AACF). In a letter (dated 11 June 1958) to founding AACF secretary H. Richard Krygier, Richard Casey said, ‘I am indeed sympathetic towards the aims of your association.’ Notable AACF members were Sir Eugene Gossens (Vice President), and Ian Clunies-Ross (CSIRO head). 306 MRA, CIA & ASIO Initially called the Oxford Group, Moral Rearmament was a Christian-spiritualist movement founded by Nazi supporter Frank Buchman who planned to use MRA to create ‘ ...a one-world religion based largely on Teutonic, Aryan, and other pagan traditions mixed with Christianity. Buchman saw Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism as being compatible with his brand of Christianity... Hitler, too, had an affection for Islam and Buddhism...’ 307 MRA was hijacked and then directed by the CIA’s Psychological Strategy Board and managed under the code name ‘Packet.’ 308 MRA was used as part of a Cold War Psychological Operation aimed at ‘intellectuals, scholars and opinion forming groups’ for purposes of 305 Richard Casey, 10 th Anniversary of United States Educational Foundation in Australian , speech notes delivered at US Embassy, Canberra, 26 November 1959. 306 National Archives of Australia : Record 12812130. 307 Christopher Story (2006).

Leonas Petrauskas informed me that Beazley ‘ran kids for ASIO’ as part of a ‘dirty tricks’ counter -intelligence operation which used child prostitutes like me to compromise and control politicians. Beazley coordinated my trafficking to Parliament House and Fairbairn Airforce Base , Canberra, and Bohemian Grove , CA . In 2014, I went public regarding a 1985 ritual held inside Bathurst City Hall. Leonas Petrauskas drove me to the event which Kim Beazley Snr jointly presided over with Australian sporting icon Richie Benaud (OBE). The Bathurst City Hall ritual occurred on the same date as the Bathurst 1000 racing event, which coincided with the 55th birthday of Australian cricket ing legend Richie Benaud. Richie Benaud attended Kim Beazley Senior’s MRA Pleasant Sunday Afternoon gatherings, as did his closest friend and former cricket teammate Brian Booth who grew up in Bathurst and led Benaud’s funeral service . Kim Beazley’s children were raised in MRA. His daughter Merrilyn described MRA as a cult, while her brother Kim Christian Beazley Jnr was pro-MRA. Beazley Jnr was a renown CIA supporter like his father, starring in a staged expose documentary about Pine Gap in the 1980s. Former Ambassador to the US and Minister of Defence , Beazley attended the Bohemian Grove Luciferian pedophile revels in 2012 .

Thwaites told the media MRA was ‘a tremendous asset to me in my work in ASIO.’ 318 Thwaites attended the international MRA conferences as did Beazley Snr who wrote the foreword of Thwaites 1980 book, Truth Will Out: ASIO and the Petrov. H.V. Evatt (Former ALP leader and Communist sympathizer) accused Beazley of working for ASIO. Evatt was suspicious when he discovered Beazley went behind his back and delivered information regarding probable Communist spies to the P rime Minister .

Communists Targeted The CIA targeted Australian Communists via various direct and indirect means. In July 1949, ASIO raided the headquarters of the Communist Party of Australia whose membership had reached approximately 6,000. In 1950, Menzies’ government tried to introduce the Communist Party Dissolution Bill . ASOPA Communist Spies After the war, DORCA became ASOPA (Australian School of Pacific Administration). ASOPA originated at Holsworthy Army barracks as the Military School of Civil Affairs in the late 1940s before moving to Mosman. ASOPA was shut down in the 1980s after ASIO determined it was heavily infiltrated by Marxist Communists and operating as a Fifth Column. ASOPA subsequently became the offices for OzAid Centre for Pacific Development and Training , famously at the heart of the Clinton Foundation scandal tied to child trafficking.

Considering he immigrated to Australia at his father’s height of power, and his associates in Australia and PNG, it is evident Leonas Petrauskas was a loyal Communist rather than a National Socialist. Leonas Petrauskas and his associates were likely double spies for Soviet Russia. Kipras Petrauskas , Leona’s father, was a famous Lithuanian actor and opera singer with the National Opera Foundation. Kipras used his opera singer status to provide propaganda for one of the earlier Soviet revolutions. Kipras Petrauskas was highly influential in Soviet Russia from 1951 to 54. He received the Stalin Prize in 1951, the Order of Lenin (the highest Soviet award for both civilians and military personnel), the Order of the Red Banner of Labour , and he won the Popular Artists Award of the USSR.

Cairns was prominent in the Labour Party and a Marxist who started the counterculture in Australia. Assassinated Soviet Spies Three of my key perpetrators were seemingly assassinated for being Communist spies: Patricia Anne Conlon, University of Sydney Vice Chancellor John Ward, and Chinese heart surgeon Victor Chang. Patricia ‘Anne’ Conlon (nee Carden) was Alf Conlon’s daughter-in-law. Anne went by her middle name to distinguish herself from her mother Patricia. Her biography reads: Patricia Anne Conlon (1939-1979), feminist, Labor movement activist and public servant, was born on 2 November 1939 at Neutral Bay, Sydney. Anne was educate d at St Joseph's Convent School, Neutral Bay, Monte Sant' Angelo College, North Sydney (dux 1956), and —on a teacher's scholarship—at the University of Sydney (BA, 1961; MA, 1973) where she became senior student at Sancta Sophia College. Renowned for her soprano voice, she competed in the City of Sydney Eisteddfod, and performed in choral and musical productions at school and university. Disappointed at missing first -class honours in history, Carden taught in public high schools (which she found unrewarding) before and after spending 1964 -65 on a postgraduate scholarship at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada. At St John's College, Sydney, on 29 September 1967 she married Telford James Conlon, a physicist belonging to a Labor -connected family. In 1968 she became research assistant to John Manning Ward, professor of History at the University of Sydney, and in 1973 completed her master's thesis, Eyewitness Accounts of Australia—1815-1850. Her son was born in 1971 and her daughter in 1974. A founding member (1972) of the Women's Electoral Lobby, Conlon stood unsuccessfully as the Australian Labor Party candidate for Mosman at a by -election for the Legislative Assembly in July 1972. Next year she was a convener of W.E.L.'s first national conference in Canberra. She helped to produce submissions on conciliation and arbitration legislation to the Federal government, on the disadvantaged position of single mothers to R.F. Henderson's commission of inquiry into poverty, and —with Edna Ryan—on the minimum wage for women to the 1974 national wage case."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" 226 Awarded a grant by the Australian National Advisory Committee of International Women's Year 1975, Conlon and Ryan expanded their research into a book, Gentle Invaders (1975), which was notable both for the depth and quality of its evidence, and for its pioneering work on the history of women and labour in Australia. Conlon published articles on issues involving women in the Electrical Trades Union's E.T.U. News, Catholic Weekly and Australian Quarterly. An article ba sed on her thesis had appeared in 1970 in the Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society. In 1976 she was appointed lecturer at the Australian Trade Union Training Authority. A founding member (1977) of the New South Wales Women's Advisory Council, Conlon became special projects officer with the government's Women's Co-ordination Unit in February 1978. She worked on the Anti-Discrimination Act (1977), on an amendment to the maternity-leave provision and on the welfare of women prisoners. Her achievements impressed the premier Neville Wran. Tall and striking, auburn haired and freckled, Conlon was witty, energetic, compassionate and extremely loyal. At Sancta Sophia she had been volatile and chronically unpunctual. Although she retained her Catholic faith, she broke for a time with the institutional Church because, she believed, it had failed to respond to the women's cause. She was a good debater, and had presence and authority, but did not seek the limelight, preferring to be a 'backroom operator' and to rely on an impressive network of friends and supporters. Politically astute, she was one of the few women in WEL who belonged to the Australian Labor Party; she disavowed the prevailing philosophy that women should remain lobbyists and not join pol itical parties. To her profound grief, her marriage collapsed and in January 1979 she was divorced. Six months later she was diagnosed as suffering from cancer. Survived by her children, she died on 13 December 1979 at Mater Misericordiae Hospital North Sydney. Hundreds of people packed a requiem Mass at nearby St Mary's Church; typically, she had meticulously arranged her own funeral, even the hymns sung by the choir of her old school. She is commemorated by an annual memorial lecture sponsored by the W.A.C. and by a building at Mulawa Training and Detention Centre for Women which bears her name. 321 Here are some details Anne Conlon ’s biography missed: - Anne grew up in Greenwich where Antony Kidman lived.

In England, Anne Rule Carden, whose son James immigrated from England to Australia, was a member of both the HOGD and Theosophical Society. - Anne's father John 'Jack' Carden strangled her mother to death at their Neutral Bay home on 5 January 1984. During his court appearance, John Carden said why he killed his wife: ‘I have been blamed and abused for everything. I could not do anything right. I just could not take it anymore.’ Fabian Society Patricia Anne Conlon was associated with the Australian Fabian Society and helped them advance socialism via Cultural Marxism (gradual and reformist activities instead of overt revolt). The Australian Fabians are closely tied to the ALP. Numerous ALP ministers were active members of the Fabians while in office, including Gough Whitlam, Bob Hawke (Communist Party associate), Paul Keating, and Neville Wran – all University of Sydney graduates, all pedophiles. Faked Death Anne Conlon said she was wanted for ‘treason’ and faked own death on 13 December 1979. She hid at the University of Sydney’s Sancta Sophia College for five years, serving as a dorm supervisor under the alias ‘Veronica’ (or ‘Ronnie’) before being ‘discovered’ and died when I was 14 years old. Anne copied British Labor Party minister John Stonehouse who faked his own death after MI5 realized he was a Soviet spy. 322 Anne Conlon’s National Archives file is sealed for reasons of ‘national security’ which further supports the notion she was a spy. John Madden Ward John Ward attended Fort Street Boys High School followed by the University of Sydney where he was heavily influenced by Marxist lecturer John Anderson. Ward hid Anne Conlon at Sydney University’s Sancta Sophia College during his Vice -Chancellorship, and I recall the two having sex in her bed.

Ward, his family, and several loyal university staff were aboard the rear carriage of a steam train returning from an excursion to the Hunter Valley. A bizarre series of events, including sand being scattered on the train tracks and someone pulling a handbrake, caused Ward’s carriage to be struck and decimated by another train. Ward, his wife, daughter, and key staff were killed. Victor Chang Less than a year after the hit on Ward, famed Chinese heart surgeon (and Delta Special Forces Colonel) Victor Chang was assassinated. NSW detectives initially publicly blamed Chang’s murder on the Triads, one of Britain’s assassination groups. It seems my perpetrators, united by their involvement in MK-ULTRA and pedophilia, had divided loyalties. One faction, including ‘Comrade’ Gittinger, Petrauskas, the Conlons, Chang and Ward, were loyal to Communist Russia and China. The opposing group, including the Beazleys, Kerr, Hawke and Casey, served the British Monarchy. This scenario makes more sense of the coup that the CIA conducted against Whitlam. 1975 CIA Coup The existence of A SIS remained top secret, even from the Australian Government, until 1972 when Gough Whitlam’s ALP government targeted ASIO and ASIS for exposure. Lionel Murphy authorised raids on ASIO headquarters in 1973. Whitlam established the First Hope Commission (1974-77) to investigate our intelligence services, and he removed both ASIO and ASIS directors in 1975. Whitlam threatened to name the CIA agents in Australia and refused to renew the CIA’s lease on Pine Gap. Consistent with his election promise to ‘expose Pine Gap!’ Whitlam visited the underground base; however, during a subsequent press conference at which journalists asked him what he saw at Pine Gap, Whitlam (famous for his wit) became uncharacteristically vague and incoherent, muttering there was nothing to see. Whitlam presented as hypnotised. The CIA conducted their coup against Gough Whitlam in 1975. The film Falcon and the Snowman is based on the events surrounding this. During Whitlam’s revolt against the CIA, they referred to the British Queen’s representative as ‘Our man Kerr.’ The British Queen, in her role as Australia’s Head of State, dismissed the Australian Prime Minister through her Governor -General, Sir John Kerr, amid a manipulated ‘constitutional crisis.’ Sir Garfield Barwick (Fort St Boys High Old Boy, Chief Justice of the High Court) advised Kerr to remove Whitlam. Governor -General and CIA agent John Kerr enacted archa ic legislation to dismiss Whitlam. Traitor Bob Hawke assisted the coup by calming the Unions who were about to mass strike in protest and shut the country down. Like all Trade Union leaders, Rhodes scholar Hawke attended leadership training at Harvard. USEFA: MK-ULTRA Funding Body The Rhodes and Fulbright Scholarships were used to indoctrinate and train Australians of influence and power in England and the USA . USEFA ( US Educational Foundation in"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" 229 Australia ) was the Australian body of the Fulbright Scholarship and Lectureship Program. 323 The CIA used USEFA to transfer MK -ULTRA doctors between Australia and the USA. For example, only two psychology Fulbright Scholarships were provided in 1956, to: Raymond Cattell who attended the University of Melbourne where Oscar Adolph Oeser headed Psychology ; and Daniel L. Adler who attended ANU. He attained his PhD with MK -ULTRA co- founder Kurt Lewin. 324 USEFA was based at the ANU during its crucial years. The USA funded USEFA from its 1959 inception until 1965, via the IIE ( Institute of International Education ), a CIA conduit founded by Elihu Root (CFR founder, Carnegie Endowment co-founder, Pilgrim’s Society member) and CFR member Stephen P . Duggan (aka, the ‘Apostle of Internationalism’). Academy of Social Sciences in Australia Founded in 1942 under the name Social Science Research Council of Australia , ASSA ( Academy of Social Sciences in Australia ) became a nexus of Intelligence and MK -ULTRA operatives. For example, the 1956 ASSA Council included the usual suspects: Alfred Conlon , Herbert C. ‘Nugget’ Coombs, Oscar A. Oeser, and Cecil A. Gibb . To further illustrate, ASSA is composed of four panels of fellows. ‘Panel D’ (Education, Psychology, and Social Medicine) was staffed by MK -ULTRA researchers: Ronald Taft, Peter W. Sheehan, John Phillip Sutcliffe , Jacqueline Goodnow, Kevin McConkey , and Alan Richardson. ASSA was influenced by UNESCO and funded by the Carnegie Corporation. 325 The ASSA Council met with the heads of UNESCO Australia in October 1956 to decide the direction of their eugenics program in Australia. ASSA headquarters were located at ANU where Leonard Huxley served as chair. 326 327 ASSA worked alongside the AAS ( Australian Academy of Science ). 328 Leonard Huxley sat on the AAS Council in 1956 and became Vice -President the following year. 329 Leonard Huxley : Australia n MK-ULTRA Coordinator Thomas Huxley (1825 -95) established the Huxley -Wedgewood family connection to Australia and PNG when he spent three years (1847 -49) exploring the region.

McCaffrey in 1956. MK-ULTRA co-founder Gregory Bateson was one of John McCaffrey ’s refere es. John McCaffrey’s Fulbright research proposal outlined a visual approach to recording feedback from Aborigines via their artwork. This study mirrored an unethical MK -ULTRA experiment by US Military doctor Alexander H. Leighton at the Japanese War Relocation Centre at Poston, Mojave Desert. Both studies aimed to learn about the concept of feedback which is relevant to understanding human personality. 331 The significance of feedback was discovered in a brainwashing experiment at McCaffrey’s Stanford University . Julian Huxley wrote a letter (dated 7 October 1953) to the wife of ASIO founder Richard Gardiner Casey, suggesting she ask her husband to facilitate the anthropological study of Indigenous Australians as follows: (a) release an amateur anthropologist from his federal Government position to pursue an expedition financed by a major US University; (b) finance the research of professional anthropologist Ted Strehlow (expert in Aboriginal spiritual knowledge including myths and ‘ritual’ and who previously taught at Conlon’s DORCA), and (c) appoint Strehlow as a Social Studies Professor at ANU . Huxley said of Strehlow: He has just made some colour films, one of which I saw, on some Aboriginal totemic ritual – it is the most wonderful record of a primitive ritual that I have ever seen . He still appears to have difficulty in getting money – a trivial sum – to put a good soundtrack on it. I wonder if the Minister for Territories [Richard Casey] could help in this?...

Rowley, with contributions from Ronald Taft and John Phillip Sutcliffe . 335 Two other MK-ULTRA operatives received ASSA research funding in 1956 : Oscar A. Oeser and John Phillip Sutcliffe. Oscar Adolph Oeser Oscar Oeser was recruited as a British Intelligence officer by Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond series. 336 Oeser employed Tavistock founder Eric Trist to conduct research in 1935. 337 Oeser was the founding Professor of the University of Melbourne Psychology Department, and 1956 Chair of the APS. In 1956, Oeser was in contact with Richard Gardiner Casey who founded Australia’s intelligence organisations (ASIO and ASIS) in association with the CIA and MI6. As Minister for External Affairs, Richard Casey held authority over the USEFA / Fulbright Scheme in Australia until he left office in 1960. Oeser’s name appears in the 1959 recommendations list for Fulbright Lecturer/Research scholars. Oeser received Leverhulme, Carnegie and Rockefeller scholarships to tour Asia, Europe, UK and the USA. Australian Links to CIA Personality Research University of Western Australia. In 1949, psychologist Ronald Taft commenced work for the Rockefeller -funded Institute of Personality Assessment and Research (IPAR) with ‘veterans of Henry Murray’s OSS Assessment team.’ In 1961, University of Western Australia’s Professor Taft received a CIA Human Ecology Fund (HEF) research grant to study the Relationship between Health, Personality and Environmental Factors in Groups . That same year, Martin Orne received HEF finance for Attitude Formation, Decision Matrices . Robert E. Goodnow also received CIA funding for his ‘Personality Studies’ in 1961. Jacqueline and Robert Goodnow . Ronald Taft and Alfred Hammer were closely tied to Jacqueline Goodnow, the Australian child psychologist who specialized in personality and cognition. Jacqueline interned at MK-ULTRA hub St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington, DC. 338 The Freemasonic Scottish Rite Schizophrenia Research Project (SRSRP) was based at the hospital. Winfred Overholser, the 32⁰ Freemason who ran St. Elizabeth’s (1937-1962) was directly involved in the SRSRP project. In 1951, Jacqueline married Robert E.

The PAA folded after its CIA operation was exposed. In 1971, The Washington Post reported, ‘the new operating group is seeking to divest itself of the CIA financial sponsorship.’ A year later, Sidney Gottlieb, head of CIA mind control operations, fled to Australia and disappeared without a trace. The Goodnows’ official association with PAA ended in 1974 - the same year Gittinger first assessed me in Australia.

Alfred Hammer became Emeritus Professor at Macquarie also. MK-ULTRA Transferred to Australia Antony Kidman also returned to Australia in 1972. John W. Gittinger regularly visited Australia to oversee MK -ULTRA, and train and supervise MK -ULTRA perpetrators including Antony Kidman. Gittinger used me to demonstrate his methods. MK-ULTRA’s 1971 public exposure in the US preceded mass IQ testing in N SW government schools, recruitment in government children’s homes and other institutions, and the removal of all psychiatric patients from Milson Island in the Hawkesbury River north of Sydney (which became a MK - ULTRA research facility). I deduce the CIA transferred the operation to socialist Australia where it was easier to conduct clandestine child recruitment. Antony Kidman studied psychology at the University of Sydney during Martin Orne’s 1960 lectureship. From 1969 to 1972, Benjamin Weiss supervised Kidman in the Laboratory of Preclinical Pharmacology at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, Washington DC. St. Elizabeth’s was an LSD research hub and served the Scottish Rite Schizophrenia Research Program (SRSRP).

In 1936, Julian Huxley encouraged his friend Julian Trevelyan to participate in a mescaline study at the Maudsley . 344 Julian’s brother Aldous Huxley later wrote about his experiences of taking mescaline. 345 Julian Trevelyan married the great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin, making him related to the Huxleys. Most pre-WW2 IoP finance came from the Rockefeller Foundation, which enabled an exchange of doctors between the London’s Maudsley and Nazi Germany. 346 The IoP was initially Tavistock clinic’s competitor; but came under Tavistock control when the British Army and Intelligence crowd, including John Rawlings Rees and Eric Trist, commenced operations there . Julian Huxley later promoted the IoP work of Eliot Slater, 347 the British Eugenics Society Vice-Chair who work ed extensively with William Walters Sargant (who served MI5 and MI6). From the late 1950s onward, the IoP was home to MK -ULTRA Sub-project 111 directed by Hans J. Eysenck. 348 Australian psychologist Donald W. McElwain conducted psychological experiments at Maudsley in the early 1950s. 349 350 Australian psychologist Wendy Thorn travelled to the IoP to conduct research with Hans Eysenck who lectured at the University of Sydney during his 1977 Australian tour. 351 Other Australian-Maudsley connections are apparent from William Sargant’s involvement at the hospital, since he influenced serial killer Harry Bailey.

His ho me served as the first headquarters of Rothschilds’ B'nai B'rith assassin group. CIA psychologist Martin Seligman continue d the murderous legacy: The CIA’s ‘enhanced interrogation techniques,’ outlined in a controversial report released earlier this month from the Senate Intelligence Committee, was influenced by a Penn professor’s research. Psychology professor Ma rtin E.P. Seligman famously conducted studies at Penn in the 1960s that revealed a ‘learned helplessness’ in dogs subjected to repeated electric shocks. Instead of adjusting their behaviour upon receiving multiple shocks, the dogs remained in place, providing valuable insight into the workings of depressed or abused persons. Now, his research is being used for torture rather than healing according the Senate report. 355 Martin Seligman conducted torture research at America’s MK -ULTRA hub, the University of Pennsylvania. He and Steven Maier electrocuted dogs trapped in cages. They observed some dogs became unresponsive and lost the ability to avoid the torture . Seligman called the resultant condition ‘Inescapable Shock’ - but changed this to the more palatable ‘Learned Helplessness.’ Louis Jolyon West and B.F. Skinner repeated Seligman’s electric shock experiments at Harvard using intellectually disabled children, some three years old. Martin Seligman spent a 1975 ‘sabbatical’ at the Maudsley IoP where he met Hans Eysenck, studied phobias and obsessions, and developed Learned Helplessness methods. 356 Seligman attended the IoP alongside Stanley Rachman with whom he previously collaborated on Learned Helplessness research. 357 358 359 354 Kings College London, Nicole Kidman establishes IoPPN Scholarship in Health Psychology , 22 March 2016. 355 Dan Spinelli (2014).

The meeting included at least one Mossad agent plus psychologist James Mitchell who was paid $81 million to develop the CIA torture programme . In 2014, a US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report concluded: (a) the CIA ‘enhanced interrogation’ program was counter-productive to its expressed goal of gathering intelligence ; (b) James Mitchell developed a ‘menu’ of 20 torture techniques including waterboarding and sleep deprivation; and (c) Mitchell used SERE ( Survive, Evade, Resist, Escape ) tactics to develop the CIA torture program. SERE tactics were derived from Chinese brain-washing techniques used on US POWs during the Korean War. 362 363 SERE include s MK - ULTRA methods found in the Kubark Manual (1963) and the CIA Phoenix Program. (Incidentally, on 24 February 2004, Martin Seligman was one of only 40 or so guests who attended The Edge ‘Billionaires Dinner’ at Monterey, CA with child trafficking pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.) The APA ( American Psychological Association ) commissioned an independent report to determine the role the ir organisation played in Seligman’s CIA torture programme. The report revealed direct collusion at the highest levels of the APA which ensure d psychologists like Martin Seligman and James Mitchell could participate in abusive torture methods. 364 In 2010, the US Army awarded Martin Seligman a $31 million no-bid contract to develop a ‘resilience training’ program for soldiers. The resultant Comprehensive Soldier Fitness Program was an unethical research project under the guise of an exercise program. 365 Martin Seligman’s unethical experiment denied soldiers’ rights to informed consent and forced them to abandon critical thinking and respond more obediently using Positive Psychology. In a component called ‘Spiritual Fitness’ soldiers were told religion is essential to achieve better mental health. Positive Psychology promotes Tibetan Buddhism , meaning Buddhism was the religion forced on soldiers during Seli gman’s experiment. The US Army admitted the experiment’s purpose was to produce an ‘indomitable army.’ Seli gman & Kidman Antony Kidman became a lifelong associate of Martin Seligman at the University of Pennsylvania where he studied under Aaron Tim Beck, father of CBT ( Cognitive Behavioural 360 Maria Konnikova (2015).

The resultant 1975 paper, The Experimental Contusion Injury of the Spinal Cord in Sheep, was co-authored by J.D. Yeo, W. Payne, B. Hinwood, and A.D. Kidman. 367 The researcher s used an ‘impounder’ to simulate spinal trauma, paraplegia and sensory loss in the hind limbs of sheep. The spinal injury created a neurological response like electric shock , only more intense. While the other three researchers were interested in paraplegia and observing the efficacy of treatments applied to spinal cord trauma, biochemist Kidman focused on the post-trauma effects of norepinephrine . Kidman and his colleagues found: (a) A fourfold increase in the levels of or norepinephrine ; (b) Low levels of dopamine within one hour have not been substantiated in more recent work by other laboratories ; and (c) The time interval following the trauma is important and further work on monoamine ‘turnover’ is necessar y to elucidate this complex problem . The cause of the Learned Helplessness phenomena was unclear at that time of Kidman’s sheep research, with some theorising it was a rapid norepinephrine depletion following the initial shock or trauma. 368 The resultant article cited a 1974 paper concerning a similar experiment with cats. 369 The cat study is cited in a 2007 article (titled, ‘The Role of Stress in Recovery of Function After Spinal Cord Injury’ ) which also cites Seligman’s 1975 Learned Helplessness Theory. In other words, Kidman’s sheep experiment was linked to Seligman’s Learned Helplessness research via relevant citations, plus its aim, method, and neurotransmitter observations. Positive Psychology : MK-ULTRA Mind Control Positive Psychology began in the 1960s with humanistic and existential psychology, which emphasized reaching innate potential and creating life meaning. MK-ULTRA doctor Abraham Maslow coined the term ‘Positive Psychology’ to describe his work. Albert Ellis, the ‘unsung hero of positive psychology,’ demonstrated his original work at a 1960s Esalen Institute seminar. 370 371 Positive Psychology is fundamentally connected to both Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Learned Helplessness. 372 Walter Reed Army Hospi tal psychologist Aaron T. 366 M.E.P.

Positive Psychology is based on CBT. 373 Beck explained the similarities between CBT and Positive Psychology during a 2012 Beck Institute Workshop. Aaron Beck and Albert Ellis influenced Martin Seligman and Antony Kidman and their introduction of CBT and Positive Psychology to Australia. Seligman introduced Positive Psychology in his first address as American Psychological Association President in 1998, with fellow APA member Antony Kidman in attendance. 374 Kirk J. Schneider criticised Seligman’s Positive Psychology for distorting reality . He found high levels of positive thinking to correlate with ‘ Positive Illusion’ : What the researchers don’t help us to understand – and what will be essential to understand if we are ever to substantively broach human vitality – is how positivity ratios also appear to correlate with destructive human tendencies. For example, a growing body of research appears to suggest that what the researchers call high positivity – a disposition to pleasant, grateful, and upbeat feelings – also correlative with a dimension called ‘ positive illusion’ (relative inaccuracy regarding reality) ; and that negativity (or what is generally characterized as mild to moderate depression) is correlated with relatively greater accuracy concerning reality. These findings, moreover, also appear to square with recent correlations between highly positive people and suppressed psychological growth, inability to self -reflect, and racial intolerance . 375 Positive Psychology reduces the individual’s ability to critically think and understand reality, effects consistent with the goals of the eugenics project we know as MK -ULTRA. Positive Psychology correlates with Positive Illusion - inaccuracy regarding reality . CIA Positive Psychology & Buddhism Conference s Since 2006, Sydney has hosted yearly conferences that jointly promote Buddhism and Positive Psychology. The Happiness and its Causes conferences are organised by the Dalai Lama and the Vajrayana Institute . The Dalai Lama is a well -documented CIA asset with a long history of receiving CIA funding. The Dalai Lama himself was on the CIA's payroll from the late 1950s until 1974, reportedly receiving $US15,000 a month ($US180,000 a year). The funds were paid to him personally, but he used all or most of them for Tibetan government -in-exile activities, principally to fund offices in New York and Geneva, and to lobby internationally. 376 373 Dennis Greenberger ( 2014).

Ekman collaborated with MK -ULTRA hub, the University of Western Australia, on weaponised anthropology in PNG. UWA lecturer Ronald Taft channelled CIA money into similar studies. 381 Paul and his daughter Eve Ekman operate the Paul Ekman Group who do contract work for the CIA and FBI, and offer training in lie detection, body language analysis and other methods relevant to CIA interrogation and mind control operations.

He was also involved in the Nimrod Theatre, and appeared in films including Mad Max, Dimboola, Blue World Order, The Matrix, and he voiced Sauron in Lord of the Rings. Spence was a University of Sydney OTO member who participated in the crucifixion ritual murder in the Great Hall. After I first reported Bruce Spence as my perpetrator, he responded by poking fun at me in a TV show which attempted to discredit my testimony . The program featured a group of people investigating a Luciferian cult, wearing tin foil hats. Bruce Spence played a Luciferian dressed in OTO ritual robes who devoured a baby before instructing a samurai sword wielding young female MK -ULTRA assassin to murder a pedophile hunter and ‘ make it look like an accident.’ Bathurst Founded on Freemasonry While designing Bathurst’s belltower, architect Henry Bialowas realised the entire town was originally designed according to hidden math and sacred geometry that depict the solar system and planets, and astrological themes. Bathurst was planned around the golden ratio and divided into squares that are numbered in a spiral formation. The central square, which contains a Catholic church, was intentionally left unnumbered because it sits at the omega point - which can’t be named, numbered or bound, and begins and ends in infinity. Freemason Thomas Mitchell was Bathurst’s town planner. Mitchell belonged to the 59 th Regiment attached to its own Freemason military lodge, and his patron, George Murray, was Grandmaster of the London Lodge. Bathurst contained several Freemason lodges, one of which David Waddel was Deputy. David’s daughter Leila Ida Nerissa Bathurst-Waddel, an artist and musician, was Aleister Crowley’s mistress. (A ‘Bathurst’ family in the UK was related to the British Royals). Leila Bathurst-Waddel helped establish the OTO in Australia and she became its highest- ranking member. The OTO has a female chapter called the Order of the Eagle into which I was initiated. Leila Bathurst-Waddle was posthumously inducted into the Order of the Eagle in April 1999. Russian Helena Blavatsky was posthumously inducted in 2000 . During the Bathurst Luciferian ritual I attended, the cult hung a large satin Order of the Eagle banner on the Bathurst City Hall stage. Engadine Medical Centre When I knew Leonas Petrauskas he lived within walking distance of my grandmother’s Engadine house and owned and operated the local Engadine Medical Centre with fellow Luciferian John Melov. In 2015, an Engadine resident named Pat told Steve McMurray and I that Petrauskas referred her to Harry Bailey. Pat described both physicians as unethical and how her prescription of experimental medication resulted in her growing a beard. Pat’s husband described bizarre experiments being performed on children at a small private Engadine hospital that Petrauskas and Melov owned and operated. He saw a five -year-old girl submerged in a tub of ice with tubes protruding from her orifices. ‘Cowboy’ Harry Bailey Referring to the Tulane University psychosurgery experiments he c onducted with Robert Heath (contractor to MK -ULTRA Subproject 68), Harry Richard Bailey boasted: "},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" 241 It was cheaper to use Niggers than cats, because they were everywhere, and they were cheap experimental animals. 385 Harry Bailey received a 15-month World Health Organization fellowship to study psychosurgery, ECT and Deep Sleep Therapy with Ewen Cameron and William Sargant. 386 Upon returning to Australia, he headed the new Cerebral Surgery and Research Unit at Callan Park Psychiatric Hospital in Sydney. In September 1957, the Sydney Sunday tabloid published an article about a Callan Park experiment, headlined: ‘Human Guinea Pigs in Test: A Sydney mental specialist and 15 other volunteers deliberately sent themselves temporarily insane in recent mental research tests.’ In this article, Bailey promoted LSD as a potential treatment for ‘mental cases’ and said his experiments were aimed at identify ing the brain area affected by schizophrenia. Harry Bailey was appointed Medical Superintendent of Callan Park in 1959. In 1961 h e entered private practice in Macquarie Street, where Sydney’s early gay and lesbian activists protested after Bailey tried to ‘cure’ a man’s homosexuality with lobotomy. Bailey’s research associate Robert Heath did the same . Heath also paid a prostitute to have sex with a suicidal gay man whose brain response was read via an ECG. 387 MK-ULTRA at Chelmsford Harry Bailey founded a private hospital with doctors John Herron, Ian Gardiner and John Gill. Chelmsford Private Hospital became Australia’s worst psychiatric disaster where over 1,400 patients were subjected to hypnotic drugs, ECT and DST in a mostly expe rimental fashion without informed consent. The entire Chelmsford medical team were previously involved in a eugenics program of forced adoption at Sydney’s Crown Street Hospital for Women where babies were taken from ‘unfit’ mothers and given to mothers de emed more appropriate. 388 A massive 64% of unwed mothers had their babies stolen at Crown Street Hospital. Harry Bailey used hypnotic drugs to make the reluctant birth mothers comply . He directly ordered the abortion of twin foetuses without the consent of a woman who was under the influence of hypnotic drugs. Harry Bailey was William Sargant’s Deep Sleep Therapy protégé and the two maintained contact during Bailey’s MK -ULTRA work in Australia. Sargant authored Battle for the Mind: A Physiology of Conversion and Brainwashing , a book lauded by Aldous Huxley. Harry Bailey competed with Sargant by seeing how long he could keep Chelmsford patients in a state of Deep Sleep. Ewen Cameron caused permanent damage to over 50 patients with his brainwashing experiments. Harry Bailey topped that statistic by killing at least 85 patients at Chelmsford Private Hospital via ECT, Deep Sleep Therapy, and drug experiments. 389 Harry Bailey sexually seduced vulnerable Chelmsford patie nts, as young as 18 years old, and coerced them into signing their wills over to him.

Bailey also raped victims while they lay in drug -induced comas. In 1974, Bailey placed a young woman named Bronwyn Colefax in a drug-induced coma and repeatedly electrocuted her for a fortnight until her leg shrank to half its size and her brain was permanently damaged. A 1967 coronial inquest into five Chelmsford deaths went nowhere. The hospital closed in 1979 following multiple complaints. Bronwyn Colefax became the first victim to sue Harry Bailey who ‘suicided’ via a drug overdose in 1985 while under investigation. The Grande Council , including Antony Kidman and Leonas Petrauskas, congregated in the University of Sydney ’s Maclaurin Hall to decide ‘Cowboy’ Harry Bailey’s penance for threatening to expose MK-ULTRA in Australia. In 1990, the Chelmsford Royal Commission concluded John Gill, ‘must bear a large part of the responsibility for the consequences of Chelmsford both in terms of the suffering and sometimes deaths of patients.’ John Gill was charged with manslaughter and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, but our High Court ruled the deaths occurred too long ago to prosecute, and prosecution would constitute an ‘abuse of process.’ John Gill continued practising. Ian Herron was referred to the DPP regarding his involvement in the deaths of a police officer in 1974 plus a journalist in 1976, but no charges were laid. In 1980, a court awarded ‘compensatory and aggravated damages’ against Ian Herron for ‘wrongful imprisonment, assault and negligence ’ against a former patient. Chelmsford, Scientology & the CIA I met Bronwyn Colefax who gave me the facts surrounding her Chelmsford case. In the early 1980s, Bronwyn’s lawyer warned the CIA were involved in Chelmsford and would tap her phone. The CIA employed the ir cult cut-out, the Church of Scientology , to exact damage control measures in the Chelmsford aftermath. The Scientologists established an advocacy and support service , Citizens Commission on Human Rights, for the many Chelmsford victims who came forward after Bronwyn Colefax tested the legal waters. 390 The Scientologists collected victim witness testimonies and evidence, thus enabling the CIA to target any victim who threatened to expose the fact that Chelmsford was a MK -ULTRA research centre. Legal Hypocrisy An investigative journalist wrote a 2016 book about Scientology in Australia which included a chapter about Scientology’s involvement in Chelmsford. The chapter simply restate d the facts of the Chelmsford Royal Commission findings concerning John Herron, Ian Gardiner, and John Gill. 391 In late 2018, a judge ruled the chapter defamed the Chelmsford doctors, ordered publishers to pay the Chelmsford doctors’ legal costs, and ruled the defendants must prove the facts of the orig inal Chelmsford case. So, 30 years after the Chelmsford doctors escaped prosecution because High Court judges ruled the case was too old, a judge decides the case is not too old. Bronwyn Colefax is outraged at the decision which she believes is an ‘abuse of process .’ Such a ruling would be impossible if Australia had a Bill 390 Steve Cannane (2016).

Australians have no Freedom of Speech; this sad fact, co mbined with our harsh defamation laws, protects Australian perpetrators. The only thing that makes sense of this judicial decision is that the CIA are desperate to continue the coverup of the MK-ULTRA crimes their doctors committed at Chelmsford Private Hospital. MK-ULTRA and the Australian Cults The CIA began using cult cut -outs to conceal MK -ULTRA mind control activities, in 1963. Australian cult cut-outs included Scientology, Mormonism, Buddhism, Yoga Ashram, Hare Krishna, Orange People , Kenja, Christian life Centre (aka, Hillsong ) and the OTO. These child abuse cults provided fertile ground for MK -ULTRA victim recruitment. The Orange People were led by Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. The cult established a large following in Sydney and Western Australia before moving to Oregon in the USA. The cult renamed themselves Osho and many Australian members settled on communal properties in and around Byron Bay, including a 40-hectare commune called Gondwana Sanctuary. Kenja was founded in 1982 by Ken Dyers who joined the Church of Scientology after leaving the Australian Army. In 1993 he was charged with sexual offences against four young girls but escaped conviction. He was charged with child sexual assault in 2005 but suicide d before the case could return to court. Hare Krishna’s cult headquarters are located on a northern NSW farm. As a parole officer I encountered numerous cases of child abuse perpetrated at the Hare Krishna farm. Yet my true understanding came through my father who closely associated with its members, and the home midwifery association my mother worked with. The Krishna cult had its own midwife who delivered babies whose births went unregistered. My father attended Luciferian rituals, and witnessed an underground arsenal, at their Eungella compound. My younger siblings were ritually abused by members of this cult, notably a witch who used the cult pseudonym ‘Roochie’ and claimed her Indian-looking son, the product of an affair in India, was the result of a miraculous conception by Krishna. Roochie subsequently re verted to her original name, Sharon, and joined the U sana pyramid selling scheme which I discovered to be another satanic cult front. The Family stemmed from the US Children of God pedophile cult which changed its name following negative publicity. Yoga teacher Anne Hamilton-Byrne led t he Australian branch of The Family . Hamilton-Byrne was guided by Swami Muktananda, who worked with Wyatt Woodsmall , who instructed NXIVM co-founder N ancy Salzman in mind-control. Another notable cult associate is Julian Assange whose mother married Leif Meynell- Hamilton, a musician and member of The Family . The Family was alternatively called Santiniketan Park Association , or The Great White Brotherhood - a term coined by Luciferian Helena Blavatsky and pedophile Charles Webster Leadbeater (high-ranking Freemason, Theosophist, and member of Aleister Crowley’s OTO). According to Leadbeater, a colony was to be established in Baja California by the Theosophical"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":" 244 Society under the guidance of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom , for the intensive selective eugenic breeding of the sixth root race (i.e., a branch of the Aryan fifth root race). 392 Leadbeater’s cult location mov ed from California to Australia. Hence the idea behind The Family was to foster an Aryan bloodline which would eventually reincarnate a New World leader. Anne Hamilton-Byrne acquired 28 babies and young children during the 1960s and ‘70s. Some wer e the natural children of cult members, others stolen via a network of cult doctors, social workers and lawyers. One child victim, Sarah Hamilton-Byrne, said in her biography that medical practitioners in Melbourne and Geelong stole infants by telling mothers their babies had died at birth. 393 The children’s identities were changed using false birth certificates or deed poll and given the surname 'Hamilton-Byrne.' They were told Anne Hamilton-Byrne was their biological mother, and to address adult cult member s as 'Aunty' or 'Uncle .' ( My perpetrators were similarly called my ‘family’ and I had to address members as ‘Aunty’ or ‘Uncle.’). Hamilton-Byrne dressed the children alike and dyed their hair white . The kids were isolated from society and home -schooled at Kia Lama ( Uptop ), a rural property at Taylor Bay on Lake Eildon, Victoria where they were subjected to MK -ULTRA mind control methods including isolation, beatings, starvation, drugging, and sensory deprivation. The y were administered LSD and subjected to sensory deprivation in a dark room when they reached adolescence . The Family recruited middle -class professionals, with one-third of members being nurses and other medical practitioners. It had numerous intelligence connections. Michael Stevenson-Helmer, a 19-year-old law student interested in eastern religion, later became a Family cult leader . Stevenson-Helmer comes from a prominent Jewish family including CIA agent Sir Zelman Cowen (Royal Australian Navy, B'nai B'rith member, Governor -General 1977- 82) and KGB Agent Dr John Helmer who was also involved with The Family . Richard Casey visited ‘Kai Lama’ where they hid the kidnapped children, and he is rumoured to have made personal donations to the cult. The ‘Santinekitan’ property was owned by CIA agent Sir John Latham. Raynor C. Johnson was The Family’s true founder. A member of the Society for Psychical Research , Johnson worked for the University of Melbourne Physics Department at a time when the institution supported the RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force). Johnson recruited members to The Family by referring them to Hamilton-Byrne's hatha yoga classes. Raynor Johnson and Anne Hamilton -Byrne were mentored by Thomas Maughan (Theosophist, Chief Druid, British Navy Intelligence Officer).

Anne Hamilton-Byrne had other ties to RAAF Intelligence : she was raised on an RAAF base, and married an RAAF Lieutenant. Australian military children like her were commonly recruited into MK -ULTRA. Hamilton-Byrne married RAAF Intelligence Officer Lionel Harris who, she said, was killed by a KGB officer in 1955 while working for ASIS. Another RAAF connection was psychiatrist Lance Howard Whittaker, The Family ’s principal MK -ULTRA doctor. Whittaker was an RAAF Wing Commander during the cult’s heyday. During the 1960s and ‘70s, Family cult member Marion Villimek owned Newhaven Psychiatric Hospital in Kew, a private facility staffed exclusively by Family cult members and associated MK -ULTRA doctors. At Newhaven, Whittaker conducted mind control research with Ronald Conway (RAAF, Freemason, Oscar Oeser protégé, and pedophile ) and LSD studies with MK-ULTRA psychiatrist John Mackay. The Family used Newhaven to recruit new cult members from its patients, and to administer LSD to cult members. In the late ‘60s, an early cult recruit was given LSD, ECT plus two lobotomies. In 1992, Newhaven closed after an Inquest was ordered into the 1975 death of a Deep Sleep therapy patient. Whittaker abandoned his wife and children at The Family property. He commenced work at the Mayday Hills Psychiatric Hospital in Beechworth in 1970, where he used sodium amytal on patients during therapy sessions, and he subject ed severely psychotic patients to three -day Deep Sleep Therapy comas. Sarah Hamilton-Byrne escaped the cult, alerted police who rescued the other children, and went on to graduate from high school and medicine. Police raided Kia Lama on 14 August 1987. Anne Hamilton-Byrne and her husband William subsequently fled overseas for six years. Police eventually extradited the couple back to Australia and charged them with conspiracy to defraud and commit perjury by falsely registering the births of three unrelated children as their own triplets. Lawyer Elizabeth Whitaker, wife of psychiatrist Howard Whitaker, acted as their co-defendant. The Hamilton-Byrnes pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of making a false declaration and were fined $5000. Anne Hamilton-Byrne lived to a ripe old age of 94 years. Police dropped a charge against Howard Whitaker who maintained the respect and support of Victoria’s medical fraternity . The Australian government’s coverup of The Family is indicative of Project MK -ULTRA. Satyananda Yoga Ashram renamed themselves Mangrove Yoga Ashram after the federal Royal Commission exposed them as Luciferian pedophiles in 2014. Children as young as four were starved, tortured, drugged, beaten, had their heads flushed down a toilet, and subjected to ‘horrific’ sexual and physical abuse at Satyananda Yoga Ashram in the 1970s and 1980s. Nine victims testified to the Royal Commission . One victim described being subjected to a Tibetan Buddhist black magic ritual at age six years. She was taken into a dark room lit with candles where a group of male swamis chanted, and gang raped her. The men restrained 395 Raynor Johnson (1959).

Dr Sandra Smith is a psychiatrist who taught yoga at the Yoga Ashram and lied to the Royal Commission under cross examination about the abuse that occurred there . Sandra Smith and her lawyer husband Keith Allen implicated in a separate Royal Commission matter. Keith Allen was cross examined (in CS42) regarding a 2001 incident where he conspired to conceal the repeated rapes of two boys by Newcastle diocese Anglican priest George Parker. The Anglican diocese Vice Chancellor, Paul Rosser, defended the pedophile priest. The presiding judge , Ralph Coolahan, also worked for the Anglican Diocese. Keith Allen, a trustee of the Newcastle Anglican diocese, acted for victim Steven Smith. Keith Allen sent his client Steven Smith to his wife Dr Sandra Smith for a psychiatric evaluation, without disclosing to the plaintiff that the doctor was his wife . Dr Sandra Smith then leaked the sensitive information she gathered during her assessment of the plaintiff - to defendant George Parker’s attorney, Paul Rosser. Anglican diocese records of George Parker’s church attendance were subsequently doctored to contradict the sexual assault dates and times provided by the priest’s victims. Notably the crucial date on which George Parker raped Steven Smith and another boy, was erased. The missing entries collapsed the case and provided an excuse for corrupt Judge Co olahan to set George Parker free . While cross examining Keith Allen, the Royal Commission accused him of evidence tampering , as the following newspaper article explains: SOLICITOR DENIES ‘FIXING’ STATEMENT TO ROYAL COMMISSION Ian Kirkwood, Newcastle Herald, 9 August 2016 ...In other evidence, Mr Allen was taken to a church register that the defence of priest CJC used in a 2001 trial that was discontinued by the Director of Public Prosecutions after the document appeared to show that the priest was not in the place that his victims, CKA and CKB, had said he was. The commission heard that there were very few alterations through any of the pages of the register except for the page that was pertinent to the trial. The commission heard that numbers, apparently relating to the number of worshippers, had been rubbed out and altered. A crucial date, April 29, 1975, was not in chronological order, and two signatures for the one person appeared to be in different handwriting. Solicitor Peter O’Brien, for victims CKA and CKB, put it to Mr Allen that ‘this document, sir, is a forgery, isn’t it?’ Fresh charges were laid against George Parker years later, but he died before facing court again. Keith Allen and Paul Rosser are still practising law instead of being charged with a criminal offence as the Royal Commission suggested . I was contacted by a former child patient of psychiatrist Sandra Smith. I n the 1980s, Dr Sandra Smith concealed the sexual and ritual abuse disclosed by the 13-year-old patient and her older sister. Sandra Smith told the victims’ mother that the sister s’ disclosure was a form of ‘childhood sexual fantasy’ and that ‘ young girls often fantasise this way about their"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":" 247 fathers.’ Sandra Smith’s psychologist colleague agreed with her diagnosis. Sandra Smith and her colleague recommended the two sisters attend family therapy with their perpetrator father, which occurred. Dr Sandra Smith further advised the teenage victim to visit the Satyananda Yoga Ashram as a form of therapeutic intervention. Decades later, the girls’ father served prison time for abusing his younger daughter (the older sister refused to testify ). He also was convicted of sexually abusing his daughter’s friend. Krista Petrauskas Leonas Petrauskas’ daughter Krista Petrauskas also associated with the Kundalini practising Satyananda Yoga Ashram located in Berowra on the NSW Central Coast. Krista stated in email: ‘ I lived here for the best part of a year. The shit hit the fan in 1986 or thereabouts after a murder .’ Krista also part-owned a Buddhist cooperative with Kabbala expert Ayya Khema in Obi, Queensland. Ayya Khema was influential in the USA and helped establish Buddhism in Australia. Krista was involved with James McGarry, a hypnotist who likes to dress up in robes and founded the Academy of Esoteric Sciences (in 1985) and Academy of Human Sciences (1977). Immediately after we filmed my Candy Girl documentary and contacted Krista Petrauskas, she contacted McGarry. After I detailed Krista’s crimes to the NSW Police, she and McGarry wiped their social media accounts, sold their properties, and disappeared. * * * "},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":" 248 MK-ULTRA in Hillsong Church And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. (2 Th. 2:11 ) The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse seemingly exposed multiple Australian church denominations for their coverup of heinous sex crimes against children. As I predicted and published in 2013, the Royal Commission took a ‘sampling approach’ to the massive child trafficking network known as the Australian churches. The Commission’s approach buried the true nature and scope of church involvement in organised child trafficking. The Royal Commission featured notable case s from each of Australia’s major denomin ations including the Roman Catholics, Salvation Army, Jehovah Witnesses, Anglicans, and Assemblies of God. None of these were new revelations, but cases that had already been prosecuted or published in the mainstream press. I will now follow suit and highlight one case example – Hillsong. Azusa Street Origins The Australian branch of the Assemblies of God (AOG) was founded in 1937 and is our largest Pentecostal movement. It has approximately 1,000 affiliated churches. In 2007 the AOG changed its name to Australian Christian Churches (ACC). The AOG was a soft CIA target due to its Azusa Street ‘revival’ roots. The A OG claim to be a separate mov ement, but the pioneers of the Australian AOG movement were themselves influenced by Azusa and A OG USA. The Azusa Street ‘revival’ was started by Charles Fox Parham. In 1907, Parham was arrested and charged with sodomy in Texas. William Seymour received ‘Holy Spirit baptism’ while at Bible school under Parham. Seymour began preaching about Holy Spirit baptism in a barn/warehouse on Azusa Street. A ‘revival’ began in April 1906 and lasted until 1913. During this time, thousands of people visited 312 Azusa St. to receive the Holy Spirit baptism, and thousands of Pentecostal missionaries established churches around the world. Pentecostals and Charismatics revere Azusa as a genuine move of God in restoring the Church to true power and authority. However, the Azusa street meetings were filled with spiritualist mediums, hypnotists, and other occult ists. While Pentecostals view Azusa as the birthplace of modern Pente costalism, orthodox theologians expressed a completely different opinion of the movement: 396 - ‘ the last vomit of Satan .’ (G. Campbell Morgan) - ‘ emphatically not of God, and founded by a Sodomite .’ (R.A. Torrey) - ‘ disgusting...delusions and insanities . . . pandemoniums where exhibitions worthy of a madhouse or a collection of howling dervishes , ’ ‘ heavy toll of lunacy and infidelity .’ (H.A. Ironside) 396 Michael L. Brown (1996). Holy Laughter to Holy Fire: America on the Edge of Revival . Destiny Image, 197 - 198."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" 249 - ‘ Satan's preachers, jugglers, necromancers, enchanters, magicians, and all sorts or mendicants .’ (W.B. Godbey ) - ‘ the conduct of those possessed, in which they fall to the ground and writhe in contortions, causing disarrangements of the clothing and disgraceful scenes, is more a characteristic of demon possession, than a work of the Holy S pirit .’ (Clarence Larkin) Hillsong Links to Azusa Four independent Pentecostal organizations survived the Azusa movement , including the A OG USA which formed in 1914. AOG USA produced closet gay pastors Jim Bakker and Paul Crouch who co-founded TBN before their 1973 fallout and built Disney -like Bible -theme d parks. Crouch’s granddaughter won $2 million damages after Jan Crouch buried her rape at age 13 years by a TBN employee . The AOG USA also produced kooks like William Branham who claimed an Angel called ‘Emma’ appeared, conversed with him, and gave him spiritual gifts. Branham influenced New Zealand pastor Ray Bloomfield, under whom Frank Houston served as assistant pastor. Frank Houston’s church meetings were replete with the same strange physical manifestations witnessed at Azusa, John Arnott’s ‘Toronto blessing’, Brownsville, Pensacola, and Lakeland ‘revival’ featuring adulterous Todd Bentley who also claimed to be visited by Branham’s angel, Emma. Frank Houston had John Arnott from Toronto, and Randy Clarke (who supposedly started the Toronto Blessing) preach at his Sydney AOG Church. Frank Houston was filmed attending the Brownsville ‘revival’ with founders John Kilpatrick and Steve Hill, and he had Lila Tahune of Bronwnsville Pensacola speak at his Sydney church. Kundalini Rock Spider Rock Cult A cancer is spreading throughout protestant Christendom, a Kundalini rock spider rock cult called Hillsong. Its founder adopted a slicker, more lucrative business marketing approach than his pedophile father who tolerated knicker -flashing middle -aged women embarrassing themselves by thrashing about the floor like tuna on a trawler boat. Brian Houston removed the plaque fixed to Hillsong Church which stated that Frank Houston founded it, and he used his ill-found ‘prosperity’ to fund his facelift, hair transplant, and his wife ’s boob job. Hillsong’s renovated, conservative image proved PR palatable for Prime Ministers, Police Commissioners, and pop stars who ignored Frank Houston’s irrelevant indiscretion. Mind controlled Hillsong slaves bark, ‘Don’t touch God’s anointed!’ at the suggestion their plastic dictator concealed crimes. Hillsong franchises continue to open shop the world over, most recently breaking into the lucrative US market. Numerous other churches of various denominations imitate the Hillsong corporate model. Most Australian churches pay for the right to use Hillsong’s B-grade pop tunes. Public Perception In October 2014, the Royal Commission held a public hearing into the responses by the AOG/ACC and affiliated Pentecostal churches to allegations of child sexual abuse made against Pastor William Francis (‘ Frank’ ) Houston in 1999 and the response of Sydney Christian"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" 250 Life Centre and Hills Christian Life Centre (now called Hillsong Church ) to those allegations. The Royal Commission also examined the response of the AOG/ACC to the allegations. Frank Houston was an ordained Salvation Army officer at age 18 in New Zealand. He changed denominations twice, first to the Baptist church, and in 1960 he established his first AOG NZ church. From 1965 to 1971 he rose to the position of AOG NZ Superintendent. During those years, Frank Houston often visited Australia to preach. In 1977, Frank Houston established the Sydney Christian Life Centre and was based in Australia. In 1978, Frank Houston’s son, Brian Houston, and daughter-in-law, Bobbie Houston, joined the ministry there. In 1983, Brian and Bobbie Houston founded the Hills Christian Life Centre and the two churches merged in 1999 renaming itself Hillsong Church in 2001. Today Hillsong Church spans 12 countries including Australia. According to Hillsong, 11,000 people attend the Baulkham Hills site of the Hillsong Church each weekend and 35,000 across Australia. Both the Sydney Christian Life Centre and Hills Christian Life Centre were affiliates of the AOG. Brian Houston was the National President of the AOG from 1997 to 2009. Today Hillsong Church is an affiliate of the ACC. Royal Commission Victim ‘AHA’ (CS18) was first sexually assaulted by Frank Houston at age 7 years in 1969. His family members were good friends with Frank Houston who often visited from New Zealand to preach. In 1969 and 1970 Frank Houston, sometimes with his family, came and stayed in AHA’s home in Sydney. Frank Houston would enter his bedroom at night and se xually assault him while he was staying with them. This happened numerous times over a period of years but stopped when he reached puberty. In October 1998, AHA’s mother attended an AOG church called Emmanuel Christian Family Church and disclosed there that Frank Houston had sexually abused her son about ‘30 years ago.’ The senior pastor of that Church at the time was Pastor Barbara Taylor. Taylor and ‘evangelist’ Kevin Mudford (aka, ‘Mad Dog’) visited AHA’s house that evening and confronted the victim about his abuse disclosure . In December 2002, further allegations of child sexual abuse were made by another victim, ‘ AHG’ that Frank Houston sexually abused him in New Zealand. In 2004, Frank Houston suffered an aneurism in the care of a non-Hillsong nurse and died in the shower. NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione attended Frank Houston’s funeral to honour the serial child rapist. In February 2009, Brian Houston was told of further pedophile allegations concerning his father’s rape of victim ‘ AHH’ more than 30 years previously in New Zealand. The Royal Commission concluded, no allegations of child sexual abuse against Frank Houston were referred to the police and no civil proceedings had been commenced in Australia relevant to allegations against him. The Royal Commission chastised Brian Houston for not reporting the abuse allegations to the police. Brian Houston emerged from the public hearing to be confronted by a woman at whom he repeatedly screamed: ‘I AM NOT A PEDOPHILE!’ Security guards had to restrain Brian Houston from lunging at the woman. "},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" 251 What Hillsong and the Royal Commission Covered Up That is the official story fed to the public. Now let me share what I heard from Hillsong victims and witnesses, of how the CIA systematically infiltrated the AOG, and how the satanic cesspit called Hillsong came to be . Frank Houston was more perverted than ‘plain vanilla.’ Trainee pastor Peter Laughton was 21 years old and Frank Houston was in his 50s when the talented young musician moved into the home Frank shared with his wife Hazel. Behind every Ahab there is a Jezebel, and Hazel Houston knew all about her husband’s antics from the start. Even after the truth began emerging, Hazel pushed for Frank Houston’s pastoral restoration, citing the Biblical story of King David’s affair with a married woman. Frank Houston took advantage of Peter Laughton with Hazel’ s knowledge. HILLSONG – THE CHURCH WITH NO ANSWERS David Marr, The Sydney Morning Herald , 4 August 2007. A fallen leader of faith FRANK HOUSTON was a charismatic preacher and a sick man. He won famous souls for Hillsong - jockey Darren Beadman was one of his scalps - and sexually abused young men. He was about 60 when he undertook to cure 23 -year-old Peter Laughton's homosexuality. ‘ My counselling sessions by the senior minister were nothing more than sexual abuse disguised in the form of the need of a father's love and discipline, ’ Laughton says. ‘ Through my naivety, I enjoyed the naked beatings, the eternal bum caresses and masturbating into bottles, among other things. ’ Laughton was training to be a pastor. He says the abuse continued for about four years until 1984... Laughton's faith went first. He tells the Herald that before leaving the church in the early 1990s he gave an account to another pastor of the abusive therapy he'd received. But as far as Laughton is aware, no action was taken against the old man until he was forced into retirement by his son Brian after an allegation of pedophilia emerged in about 2000... Burying his f ather in 2004, Houston declared him a man who made mistakes but a preacher ‘ in a class of his own.’ Brian Houston’s Attempted AOG Takeover Brian Houston was once heard talking with his mother Hazel about starting his own denomination. Brian responded : ‘ Why start your own when there is a perfectly good one that you can take over? ’ He meant the AOG. Brian Houston’s AOG takeover attempt began in 1997 when he ran for the top Executive position, AOG General Superintendent (renamed National President). The current National President, Andrew Evans of Paradise AOG in South Australia, had held the office for 20 years. Andrew Evan’s 2IC Phil Hills ran against Brian Houston for the 1997 leadership"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" 252 position. Credentialed ministers were entitled to vote, plus each church could nominate additional voting delegates at the rate of 1:100 congregants. Brian’s own church, Hills Christian Life Centre (renamed Hillsong) was a mega church with thousands in attendance and therefore had incredible voting strength. To win the vote, Brian Houston bused hundreds of voting delegates to the 1997 Adelaide conference. That is how Brian Houston became AOG /ACC General Superintendent/National President for the next decade. Prior to hillsongification , AOG churches were traditionally structured to run from the congregation up, and pastors were answerable to the people. Brian Houston’s own Hillsong church was an incorporated entity run from the top down, which gave him absolute authority. Brian Houston used his position as National President to restructure the entire AOG organisation so that it too ran from the top down. This effectively gave the National Executive total control of the Australian AOG denomination. Many pastors within the AOG movement changed the governance of their own local churches to Brian’s model, which gave local pastors incredible powers over their congregations, and in turn handed incr edible power to the AOG Executive. Brian Houston’s takeover plan was interrupted by public revelation of his father’s child sex crimes, and his focus subsequently turned to damage control. Brian Houston then used his position as National President, and the new power structure, to silence victims and coverup his father’s emerging pedophilia. Another damage control move was Brian Houston taking over Frank Houston’s Sydney c hurch and merging it with Hillsong in 1999, before the AOG Executive officially acknowledged Frank Houston’s pedophilia. 1999 - National Executive Coverup Began Everyone on the 1999 AOG Board was complicit in protecting pedophile Frank Houston, as capture d in the minutes of a ‘Special Executive Meeting ’ (22 December 1999) attended by John Lewis (Chairman), Brian Houston, Da vid Cartledge, P .

It was agreed that the minutes of this meeting be kept confidential and in a special file. 2. It was noted that an allegation has been made against Rev. Frank Houston, of a single act of sexual abuse more than 30 years ago. The complainant does not wish to be identified and does not wish to make a formal complaint, but Frank Houston has confessed to the act. 3. It was agreed that the president of the A OG (Brian Houston) has acted appropriately in suspending the credential of F. Houston, standing him down from ministry and calling this special meeting of the National Executive. 4. It was agreed that: o F. Houston's credential be withdrawn forthwith o He be invited to enter the A OG restoration program o He be placed under the supervision of Ian Woods (State Superintendent NSW) o He refrain from Public ministry for 12 months o He not receive his credential until the NSW Superintendent recommends to the National Executive at the expiration of at least two years"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" 253 o He be offered counselling support if required. 5.

It was agreed that B. Houston meet with the complainant and explain the process of discipline and restoration that has been followed.

It was agreed that he be offered counselling if he desires it. 9. It was noted that legal advice has been obtained as to our obligations in this matter. 10. It was agreed that any inquiries in relation to this matter be directed to J. Lewis. AOG Intentionally Place d Kids at Risk The AOG Executive lied to Australian ordained pastors concerning why Frank Houston resigned from h is position. In a Special Executive Meeting report (dated 22 November 2000), Brian Houston outlined accusations that were raised against Frank Houston’s ‘inappropriate sexual behaviour with boys around 33 years ago’ in New Zealand, ‘involving between two and five people.’ A ‘ Special Elders Meeting ’ was convened on 29 November 2000 to ‘ discuss matters relating to the apparent moral failure b y Frank Houston some 30 years ago .’ This reads, ‘ Announcement to Church/s: It was agreed that a simple announcement concerning Frank’s retirement would be sufficient at this stage .’ A National Executive ‘ Report on trip of John Lewis and Keith Ainge to New Zealand and Sydney, 28 th 29 th November 2000 ’ reads: ‘ A total of six specific allegations have been investigated by the New Zealand executive relating to improper touching of genitals .’ This letter indicates a total of four victims were identified, and that ‘ at least 50 pastors in New Zealand are aware of the allegations... John Lewis Stressed t hat the Australian Executive preferred not to publish a statement... unless rumours became so bad that it was considered in the best interests of all concerned. The New Zealand executive agreed with this approach .’ The AOG National Executive prepared a vague statement (dated 8 December 2000) ‘ as a response to individuals if they hear rumours and approach the executive for clarification .’ It reads: ‘ The National Executives of the Assemblies of God in Australian and New Zealand have had the very sad responsibility of investigating claims of a serious moral failure against Frank Houston .’ The National Executive sent all Australian ordained AOG pastors a letter (dated 24 December 2001 ) telling them, ‘ Pastor Brian Houston received a serious accusation against his father, Frank Houston ,’ and advising pastors, ‘ We can’t see any reason for this to be announced to your church or further afield. ’ So, the National Executive knew Frank Houston was a serial pedophile, yet informed AOG local pastors of a single incident . The Executive verbally perpetuated the lie to inquiring pastors that Frank Houston experienced a ‘one off’ moment of ‘moral failure’ with a ‘consenting 16-year-old.’ Because local pastors were unaware of Frank Houston’s crimes, the"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" 254 serial predator continued to preach and access AOG children right up until his 2004 death. I was given a recording of a sermon Frank Houston gave one month before his death in which he repeatedly commented on all the ‘good-looking little boys’ seated in the audience . This recording, plus witness testimony, contradicts the claim by AOG Executive and Brian Houston that Frank Houston suffered advanced Alzheimer’s toward the end of his life. Brian Houston Systematically Restructure d the AOG Originally, the AOG National Conference was not an entertainment spectacular replete with motivational speakers and workshops . It was a simple gathering of ordained AOG pastors; a collective of autonomous fellowships which governed in voluntary cooperation. The pastors nominated and voted on its representatives who served the fellowship at district, state and national levels. Yet Brian Houston restructured the AOG so that District leaders were selected by the State, and State leaders were appointed by the National Executive, and nominations to State, District and National leaders were approved by the National body. Brian Houston passed the restructuring off as a ‘biblical model’ of implementing ‘vision.’ He claimed God spoke to the executive relative to the direction of the movement, and they would lead the AOG into destiny. The restructuring in fact made the executives a select and elite club of Brian sycophants that left no means for rank and file ministers to rid themselves of corrupt leadership. Brian Houston rewarded people who were complicit to the Frank Houston coverup (including like Ian Woods, John McMartin, Donna Crouch and Joel Abel ) with positions on the National Executive. This ‘closed shop’ structure ensured the coverup stayed covered up. The final blow to AOG leadership accountability occurred when Brian Houston removed the right of Pastors to raise business from the floor at the AOG/ACC Biennial Conference. Until Brian Houston and his minions did this, any ordained AOG pastor could ask embarrassing questions from the floor at National Conference. This right was removed under the pretence of ‘streamlining’ things, because AOG were a ‘growing movement’ and had to change for the sake of efficiency, and not consume valuable Conference time with mundane business matters that could be more efficiently dealt with on a day to day basis, etc. The new AOG inquiry / complaints process was for Pastors to submit their questions to the District, who would submit them to the State, who would submit them to the National Executive for inclusion i n the agenda (but only if they deemed the questions worthy). Every tier of governance was now stacked with ‘Brianites’ so nothing ‘uncomfortable’ would be raised at Conference , and dissenters were quickly and quietly identified. Obviously, questions about Frank Houston’s sex crimes and the Executive coverup of the same never ma de it to Conferen ce for open discussion , under the new system. Further, the once freely available printed Directory of pastor’s names, addresses and contact details was done away with, leaving the Executive with the only means of contacting ordained ministers en masse. 2009 - 2019: Brian Houston Steps Aside, yet Still Pulls Strings After 10 years of coverup and restructuring to protect himself, Brian Houston resigned from the Executive in 2009. He was replaced by Wayne Alcorn (President) and Alun Davies (VP) who have held the same offices to date. Wayne Alcorn was Brian Houston’s partner in"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" 255 crime at the infamous 1999 meeting. The 1999 Executive members were bound by their criminal actions and fear of discovery. So, although no longer a National Executive, Brian Houston continued his influence via Hillsong staff who were on the Executive, especially Donna Crouch and Joel Abel whom he promoted and made wealthy following their involvement in burying Frank Houston’s pedophilia . Big Bucks Passed Between Hillsong & AOG Brian Houston also maintained influence over the AOG/ACC Executive by paying them $300,000 per year in dues. State and National dues are like a ‘franchise fee ’ where local churches pay a percentage of their congregational tithes and offerings to the State and National Executives. The 2007 NSW Executive Meeting Minutes reveal, the State alone received at least $150,000 per annum; the National Executive typically received a similar amount. So, Brian Houston and Hillsong bought their enormous power and influence within the ACC. The money flowed both ways, since the AOG/ACC would recommend their local pastors attend the annual Hillsong Conference plus the Women’s Conference run by Brian’s wife Bobbie . The AOG/ACC also endowed Bobbie with the position of National leader of Australian Christian Women (ACW) which directs thousands of Australian women to her annual ‘Colour’ Conferences. Thus, t he AOG/ACC National and State conferences have become more Hillsong than ever and the local AOG/ACC churches are increasingly adopting a Hillsong style . Hillsong music is never free, despite the ir gushing over how God gave them the lyrics and tunes. They pimp their merchandise to local, often struggling, AOG churches and charge copyright license through CCLI ( Christian Copyright Licensing International ), another money hungry scam that violates everything Jesus Christ stood for . The Biblical Jesus Christ condemned using a ‘house of God’ as a place of commercial trade and so stormed through his own church in a rage, tossing furniture and whipping people. But Hillsong sheep typically do not read the Word, for if they did, they would not support Hillsong. Hillsong’s commercial trading does not end there. Hillsong affiliates founded the Gloria Jeans café franchise. Some US mega-churches contain McDonalds outlets. In fact, most churches have replaced the traditional post -service cuppa and homemade slice with commercial cafes located within church buildings. The Biblical concept of tithing to feed the poor, widowed and disabled is replaced with paying for a pastor’s fancy house and car, and wages for church positions that were once voluntary. Thus, most churches denominations have become apostate, just as the Bible predicted. Most churches have thrown out their Holy Ghost inspired, spiritually effective blood worship songs and hymns, and replaced these with repetitive, poorly written shite rock and heavy metal which are thrashed out by the next Australian Idol wannabe s. The Bible has been edited, based on a discarded translation found dumped in an Egyptian monastery, by occultists and sexual perverts, to omit Lucifer’s name, and stamped with occult symbols from my childhood . Post Royal Commission: 60 Minutes & NSW Police By 2014, Frank Houston and his crimes were long buried.

Brian Houston and"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":" 256 his partners in crime might have gotten away with the coverup had it not been for the Royal Commission’s 2014 Public Hearing into Case Study 18. Simeon Beckett, council assisting the chair at the Royal Commission recommended that Brian Houston be referred to the police for concealing his father’s child rapes. SENIOR COUNSEL CALLS FOR HILLSONG FOUNDER TO BE REFERRED TO POLICE Rick Morton, Dan Box, The Australian, 20 December 2014. HILLSONG Church founder Brian Houston should be referred to police for investigation after he failed to report child sexual abuse carried out by his father, the royal commission’s senior counsel has found. Simeon Beckett, counsel assisting the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, also found Brian Houston - who was national president of the Pentecostal church umbrella organisation Assemblies of God when he heard about the abuse - had a “conflict of interest” and never told police about his father Frank Houston’s abuse of a boy from the age of seven in 1970 ... Mr Beckett also found the Assemblies of God offered Frank Houston a chance to return to his ministry, despite the allegations and the fact this was against policy. The police dropped the investigation due to a ‘lack of evidence.’ Yet there had to be prima facie evidence for the Royal Commission to recommend prosecution in the first place . Some believe police dropped the case due to Brian Houston’s close friendship with NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione . On 23 October 2018, NSW MP David Shoebridge publicly called for legal action against Pastor Brian Houston for his pedophile protection crimes: 397 It is now 49 years since the abuse started, 19 years since Brian Houston was aware of it, and three years after the royal commission delivered its damning report, yet nothing has happened. It is a fact that Brian Houston is a close friend of Prime Minister Scott Morrison , who mentioned him in his inaugural speech as one of his guiding lights. It is a fact that Brian Houston is also a friend of the former police commissioner of New South Wales Andrew Scipione . Police Commissioner Scipione attended at least one annual confe rence of Hillsong and numerous services and is reportedly on a first name basis with Brian Houston. In December 2016 then Premier Baird opened the Hillsong Epicentre in Baulkham Hills, with his friend Brian Houston in attendance. There is compelling evidence that Brian Houston knew, while he was a church leader, about the abuse and about the hush payments, and that he failed to tell the police. This is a crime. We have sent correspondence to the police commissioner urging action. We have yet to receive a re ply. 397 David Shoebridge, Child Sexual Abuse, Legislative Council Hansard, 23 October 2018."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" 257 AHA has contacted my office for help. He is suffering from a life -threatening illness and is concerned justice will not be served in his lifetime. This would be a further obscene betrayal. Earlier this week the Prime Minister delivered a national apology. Survivors responded that it is actions, not words, they want. The Royal Commission told us a lot about power - how it can stand in the way of justice and how the powerful can exploit the powerless. The problem is that despite this week’s apology the powerful still seem to be immune from prosecution. No-one, regardless of their friends, should be beyond the reach of the law. This weekend Mr Brian Houston will continue to preach, and this weekend AHA will continue to demand the justice he deserves. In NSW Parliament, on 24 September 2019, David Shoebridge raised the matter again: On 23 October last year I spoke in this place about the repeated sexual abuse of a boy by Frank Houston in Sydney in the 1970s. On that occasion I referred to this boy has AHA as he was referred to in the Royal Commission. That boy is now a man called Brett Sengstock, a man who broke his silence to call publicly for justice; a brave man who deserves justice. The man who sexually assaulted Brett was Frank Houston, often known as the father of Hillsong, a serial paedophile. His son Brian Houston is the current leader of the Hillsong Church and best friend of Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Our Prime Minister is so enamoured of Brian Houston that he asked for him to be part of Australia’s delegation to the United States, only to be refused by the Trump administration . Brian Houston and Hillsong’s response to the Royal Commission’s damning findings regarding the church, included the following: ‘This Royal Commission did not directly involve Hillsong Church. The abuse committed by the late Frank Houston, the father of our senior pastor Brian Houston, occurred many years before Hillsong church existed, when he was a credentialed Assemblies of God minister in New Zealand.’ This was also their legal defence against the claims from Brett Sengstock for compensation. This church, whose so-called ‘love offerings ’ for visiting pastors can raise hundreds of thousands of dollars each Sunday, avoided paying fair compensation to Brett on a legal technicality. These ‘love offerings ’ are part of what make this brand of Pentecostalism so lucrative. While a pastor cannot take money from their own church, they can visit a neighbouring church and receive direct love offerings in cash or by cheque. This money will often be funnelled to a ‘public benevolent institution’ that the pastor has registered in his or her name. This then pays them a handsome tax - free wage and fringe benefits. In short, these ‘love offerings ’ are a con. Hillsong did eventually give some money to Brett for his damaged life and repeated assaults. He was promised a mere $10,000 hush payment at Thornleigh McDonald’s by Frank Houston and Nabi Saleh. Even that cash was forthcoming only after a call"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" 258 with Brian Houston. Brett’s testimony to the Royal Commission about this is illuminating. He said: ‘About two months after my meeting with Pastor Frank at McDonalds, I telephoned Brian Houston as I had not yet received any money from Pastor Frank. We had a conversation to the following effect: ‘Me: “What’s happening with the payment I was promised? I agreed to forgive your father.” ‘Brian: “Yes, ok, I’ll get the money to you. There’s no problem ... You know, it’s your fault all of this happened. You tempted my father .”’ When Brett finally received a cheque from Hillsong there was no note from Brian, no apology, no compassion. There is a clear continuity in leadership from Frank to Brian of this church. In fact, the church leadership who failed to report Frank’s abuse to the police despite holding numerous meetings to discuss the extent of his abuse in Australia and New Zealand, continue to lead the church. The Hillsong Church eventually stripped Frank Houston of his credentials but it allowed him to retire on a generous pension and under a cloak of secrecy about his sexual offending. It has never publicly referred to the assaults on Brett. Its only statement referred to: ‘... claims of a serious moral failure against Frank Houston. The incidents that have been investigated happened more than 30 years ago and Frank has admitted to the failure with great remorse.’ The church has since falsely claimed that Frank did not preach again after this. This claim is clearly incorrect. I am aware of multiple occasions in which he w as a visiting pastor at affiliated churches, with unhindered access to church families and their children. In this role he continued to receive so -called ‘ love offerings. ’ Brett deserves so much more than this cold, brutal dismissal from Hillsong. This ch urch, and its significant wealth, was built on the preaching of Frank Houston, whose violence and disregard for Brett does not seem to trouble Frank’s son and the current church leader. A church that reaps millions of dollars in tax -free love offerings cannot find the compassion or decency to pay Brett fair compensation for the harm done to him. Whatever the legalities, this is morally corrupt. I will finish by placing on the record what Brett wanted to tell his elected representatives about Scott Morrison ’s invitation to Brian Houston: ‘It’s a slap in the face for sexual abuse victims. It’s a slap in the face to the Royal Commission into institutional child sexual abuse, and it’s a slap in the face to the Australian Laws. It makes Mr Morrison’s apology to sexual abuse victims invalid. ’"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" 259 * * * Having weathered the Royal Commission, the only thing that bound Hillsong to the AOG/ACC was the civil action against them by victim AHA. 60 Minutes journalists identified victim ‘AHA’ as Brett Sengstock and revealed that although both AOG/ACC Hillsong and AOG New Zealand acknowledged that Frank Houston repeatedly raped Brett Sengstock, Hillsong and the AOG spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on lawyers and tactics to deny him compensation and silence him altogether . Because Brett Sengstock was dying of cancer and at risk of losing his home to costs, he abandoned hope of justice and compensation, and instead signed the ‘C ease and Desist ’ order AOG imposed on him in 2018. Brett Sengstock ’s terminal cancer prognosis finally let Brian Houston and Hillsong off the hook, and they no longer needed the AOG/ACC. So, immediately after Brett Sengstock signed the order , Brian Houston broke away from ACC to form his own global denomination. This move saves Hillsong $300,000 per annum in dues. Yet Hillsong retains the benefits of a loyal following from within the ACC who buy Hillsong music, and who attend the Hillsong Conference and Women’s Colour Conference. The only loser is the AOG/ACC who are left holding the can. But Wait... Unfortunately for Brian Houston and his pedo-protecting minions, the NSW legislation changed in late 2018, making concealing child sex abuse a ‘serious’ rather than a ‘summary’ offence. 60 Minutes confirmed the police investigation is active and ongoing: 60 MINUTES: CHURCH FOUNDER UNDER POLICE INVESTIGATION OVER HANDLING OF FATHER’S SEX CRIMES Garry McNab (60 Minutes Producer), 9News , 18 November 2018 . Brian Houston, the founder of the Hillsong Church, is under investigation by New South Wales police over his handling of the sex crimes committed by his father Frank Houston... In 2014, Brian Houston gave evidence before the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse, which later found he had failed to take the matter to the police and had a conflict of interest in dealing with the complaints against his father. It has emerged that in the wake of the Royal Commission’s findings, NSW Police began looking into his handling of his father’s crimes, an investigation that was suspended because of lack of evidence. A NSW police spokesman said the investigation has been reopened and is now ‘current and active.’ Justice for Brett Of the 1999 AOG Executive, David Cartledge is dead from a brain tumour, while Danny Guglielmucci and Steve Penny both have advanced cancer.

NZ Commission into In stitutional Abuse Trouble is also brewing for Brian Houston in New Zealand where a Royal Commission into abuse in state care was expanded in late 2018 to include those abused by faith-based institutions such as churches and religious schools. Many AOG insiders suspected that Frank Houston was raping boys back when he was a Salvation Army officer. Allegations are now emerging that Frank Houston raped kids while a Salvation Army Officer in N Z, that the Salvos kicked him out for pedophilia, that the Salvos failed to report his pedophilia crimes to the police, and that all this was common knowledge within the Houston family - something Brian Houston has strenuously denied since 1999. The N Z Royal Commission will highlight th at the Australian and N Z AOG Executives were well informed that Frank Houston raped 15-year-old Peter Fowler plus six boys aged 10 years in Lower Hutt NZ in the 1970s. The NZ Executive sent all 50 + NZ AOG pastors letters informing them of the assaults in 1998, and they paid Peter Fowler $25,000 compensation in 2003. Australian AOG Pastor and General Secretary , Phillip Powell, tried to expose these crimes from 1981 onwards, by sending faxes to Christian Life Centres (CLC) offices. Powell’s faxes accused Frank Houston of sexually assaulting children and gave specific details of various assaults. Donald Elley read one of these faxes while working at Hillsong in 1983 and questioned Frank Houston about them. Pastor Powell continued sending the faxes until the 1990s when Frank Houston finally admitted he was a pedophile. In response, Frank and Brian Houston viciously and publicly slandered Phillip Powell and destroyed his reputation and career. Phillip Powell supported Frank Houston’s NZ child rape victim Peter Fowler. Here are relevant excerpts an email (dated 8 October 2014) Peter Fowlers sent Philip Powell: I have not been invited to appear at the [Australian] Royal Commission, as my evidence relates to events that occurred outside Australia. However, I have given extensive evidence by telephone and the RC solicitors contacted me again today to ask if there were any questions I would like them to pose to Brian Houston when he appears tomorrow. I said that there were two: NZ AOG formally advised me in 2003 that Brian Houston, Hillsong, Australian AOG and the Houston Family refused to cooperate with their investigation regarding my allegations and that they may have also deliberately obstructed the criminal investigation of Frank Houston’s sexual abuse in New Zealand. 1. Why did Brian Houston refuse to cooperate and why did he ultimately obstruct the NZ investigation? 2.

"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" 261 The overwhelming thing that remains for m e is what I perceive deeply as the inherent evil of Hillsong and all that it represents. You know exactly what I mean... the worship of wealth and materialism and the lack of any social justice in its approach to community and the Christianity it claims t o represent. I find it abhorrent and deeply offensive. Hillsong is not a ministry in any sense of the word I understand. It is essentially just a business and its primary objective is profit and the creation of wealth for its shareholders...Brian and Bobbie! I imagine they will survive the Royal Commission with insincere words and PR designed to protect their empire. Unless Hillsong implodes due to greed, criminality or excessive consumption, I expect it will go on to the greater strength and power, damagin g many lives and falsely representing Christ in the process. I can only hope that they will eventually be revealed...in this world or the next, for what they really are...the moneychangers who defiled the temple of God! And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves —Matthew 21:12–13. Hillsong, Ritual Abuse & Antony Kidman I chose Hillsong as my case example to illustrate a point: Where there is smoke there is fire. Whenever you see an institution engaging in child abuse coverup implicating police commissioners and prime ministers, know that the true story involves ritual abuse, mind control, and CIA child trafficking. Hillsong took a Scientology approach to managing Frank Houston’s child rape victims. Hillsong pumped millions of dollars (leeched from its mind-controlled masses and disgusted Australian taxpayers) into stalking, harassing and legally threatening victims, and bribing AOG Executives into assisting the coverup. This is be cause like Scientology, Hillsong is a CIA cult cut -out. I have been contacted by multiple Hillsong victims (or their parent/therapist/pastor) whose testimonies combine to create a clear picture of Hillsong’s connection to Antony Kidman and CIA child trafficking. Here are some brief examples: 1. A 24-year-old woman told me Hillsong prostituted her from age two to 22 years, and that Hillsong delivered her to Antony Kidman who subjected her to mind control procedures. 2. A therapist told me her client was subjected to ritual abuse and mind control perpetrated by Antony Kidman via Hillsong. 3. A mother said Hillsong targeted, abducted, prostituted and murdered multiple children, and subjected her daughter to MK -ULTRA soldier/assassin training. She supplied me with supporting documentary evidence that NSW Victim Services compensated her two children for witnessing Hillsong ritually murder 10-year-old Helen Karipidis in an upstairs room inside Hillsong church during a 1988 Christmas service.

Hillsong , PIE & Communist s In 2017, I published the following letter on my blog sites: Dear Fiona, Thank you for standing up to these criminals. I have information for you which you might find interesting. I have to remain anonymous because going public would severely compromise my capacity to investigate this crime -ring. In 1971 an Adelaide barrister from the Communist Party of Australia created the precursor to what later became the Pedophile Information Exchange. This lawyer was the late ELLIOT JOHNSON. The Pedophile Information Exchange was formed from earli er pedophile groups such as the Lewis Carroll Collectors Guild and the (homosexual) Peter Pan Club. Another founder of this organization (from the Peter Pan Club) was FRANK HOUSTON who also founded the pseudo-church The Assembly of God. Houston was pastor of the Surrey Hills Christian Cent re which later morphed into Hillsong Church. Houston was an organizer for the Peter Pan Club when he was contacted by Elliot Johnson and asked to assist in forming a “united front” for organized pedophilia. This resulted in the formation of the Pedophile Information Exchange in February 1973. This organization was then exported to the United Kingdom. I knew Johnson personally and I have always detested the man. I have heard Johnson boast of having killed Japanese prisoners of war in Papua New Guinea during WW2. Here are some quotes from Johnson; o ‘I shot half a dozen in one afternoon ’; o ‘I shot dozens and dozens of them ’; o ‘The others would bayonet them or cut their throats , but I was more humane about it – I shot them in the back of the head.’ Johnson had a law degree at the time and knew perfectly well that his actions were a breach of the Geneva Convention. Johnson was a war criminal. Upon return to Australia Johnson became an operator for the Communist Party of Australia. Th is included bullying and indeed killing any Party dissidents. The Communist Party loaned Johnson 50,000 pounds which Johnson used to found the Adelaide law firm Johnson and Withers. Johnson also bought a house and a flash motorcar. The loan was forgiven fo r services rendered. In 1947 a man was found dead on Somerton Beach in Adelaide. This murder remains unsolved. The victim was a GRU man working for the USSR. He was collecting information on the development of British weapons in Australia. The Communist Pa rty of Australia supported him and other Soviet agents (such as HV Evatt) with sexual services. The GRU man had been paired up with a local woman communist who he got pregnant. The naive chap then thought that he could marry the woman and live a family life in Australia. He contacted the Dept of External Affairs (called DFAT now) and"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 263 asked for advice. However, that Dept had been so penetrated by communists that the GRU man was betrayed. He was told to attend the woman’s house and await the arrival of Commonwealth security officers. Instead he was attended by Elliot Johnson (with fake ID) and two Communist Party thugs dressed up in suits and ties. Johnson then poisoned the man with OLEANDER extract. This provides a deadly (cardiac) poison that kills within hours. As the man sickened , he was stripped and left to die. His corpse was then washed and redressed (by the woman – a nurse) and then transported to Somerton Beach by Elliot Johnson in his motorcar. This was one of the rare private cars in Adelaide at that time. The police had a couple of dozen model T Fords and Morris Minors. Another Johnson killing was that of the Sydney physicist Dr Gilbert Bogle in 1961. Dr Bogle was a microwave physicist who had been working on microwave modulation for guided missile systems for the British. He was recruited into the Communist Party by his boss Dr Geoffrey Chandler using s ex as the bait. The pay in Australia was poor and Bogle applied for a job in the USA. Bogle had a PhD in microwave physics and the American pay was literally 20 times that of his Australian pay. The problem was that Bell was a high security laboratory and the job required a complete FBI background check. The Communist Party fearing for their spy ring then decided to murder Bogle and then delegated that task to Elliot Johnson and Geoffrey Chandler. Johnson gave the termination order and acted as field direct or for the kill. Geoffrey Chandler then administered OLEANDER poison to Gilbert Bogle in a rum drink at a cocktail party. However, Bogle noticed the taste and commented upon it. Margaret Chandler then took a sip of the drink and was poisoned as well. Geoff rey Chandler then telephoned Elliot Johnson for instructions and was then ordered by Johnson to dump both bodies down by the river to die. Johnson was the most professional and protected criminal in Australia. In 1983 the corrupt premier of South Australia JOHN BANNON then appointed the perverted murderer to the Supreme Court of South Australia. This is how Johnson became a Supreme Court judge. This should indicate to you just how much power the pedophiles have in South Australia. I have very good reason for believing that Johnson was one of the principal members of what has been called ‘The Family’. This is the name given to the gang that killed children in Adelaide from the 1960’s to the 1980’s. It has been claimed that they are homosexuals. No! They raped and killed little girls too. I have personally heard one of Johnson’s comrades admit to raping Jane Beaumont. This informant claims that the little girl and her younger siblings Anna and Grant were strangled by Elliot Johnson. I believe it as I have heard Johnson admit to killing Japanese POWs. Johnson admitted to me that he enjoyed killing (he said that it was cathartic) and that sometimes he would give them a head start and then hunt them down. Part of Johnson’s motivations were terrorist. You might know about Red Terror. This was used by the Bolsheviks in 1918 to beat the Russian people into submission. The Muslim fanatics from Islamic State use it for this reason as well. This is why the Beaumont children were taken. This tactic really shocked Adelaide.

Why do people rape and murder kids? Just because people can’t comprehend why, that does not negate the occurrence of such. Look at the extreme pornography available and how people become sexually aroused by watching someone defecating. Most find this disgusting . Yet many find it sexually arousing. I will tell you why. As serial killer Ted Bundy explained to Christian psychologist James Dobson just before he was executed, it starts with soft porn. The nature of ‘free’ and perverted sex is that the person ceases to be aroused by a certain sex act and requires more extreme perversion to achieve arousal, until eventually the person is sexually aroused by killing kids . The person becomes addicted, and what began as ‘free’ begins to cost. Other reasons for engaging in satanic crimes include the love of money, power, recogni tion and success. A further reason is that some people who are born into a cult family are conditioned to it from birth. It is their family religion which they accept and practise just like people do in other religions which espouse strange beliefs and practises, like Mormonism which teaches each man is given his own planet to populate for all eternity with multiple wives. Ritual pedophilia and murder are integral to the religion of satanism. Followers of Lucifer are deceived into believing they inherit his kingdom when they die, just as Christians believe they go to heaven. This is the premise behind the deathbed confession of Sydney Satanist codenamed ‘Frater 616’ (or ‘Petor Narsagonan’). ‘Frater 616’ reportedly died in 2004. His confession was published on a 2010 Australian website ( loveforlife ) that was subsequently forcibly taken down. His words are consistent with everything I write in this book, and with my own experience of Satanism in Sydney during the 1970s and 80s. I probably attended rituals with this man. Frater 616 said he was recruited into Satanism in 1971 while attending a Sydney university. From his description, I perceive he was recruited into the University of Sydney ’s OTO. Don’t ask me why a cult member would want such an admission published. All I can say is the following account is consistent with my experience of the same cult. Frater 616’s confession captures the Satanist philosophy ; i t provides insight to their cult hierarchy, connections, recruitment methods, and influence.

Their antinomian influence is now so pervasive as not to be readily noticed. Amongst the highest echelons some are politicians, medical doctors, high ranking police officers, lawyers, advertising gurus, decorated military men, media personalities, fashion models and social workers . Amongst the lowest (usually temporary) ranks are prostitutes, minor drug dealers, and a number of high school students . Some operate from the mists. Their victims are drip-fed straight amnesia by an assortment of mind control measures and psychological torture tactics that would leave any normal person numb with the dawning apprehension that things are not as they seem – and they have not been for a long, long time. The most talented amongst them have lifestyles maintained on crime; but lacquered with a thin veneer of respectable professionalism and knowledge. They dress with elegance – timeless and calculating; networking and conspiring in a dream that money alone can’t purchase. Often their personalities have a force that distorts the contours both of judgement and of everyday perception. I can’t mention every name, but I will drop enough clues. The doctors refuse to say exactly how long I have but... I became involved in the whole sordid business in the 1970’s, a decade noted for little beyond sartorial bad taste and crushingly optimistic fatalism. The decade that began as a drug -crazed carry-over of the 1960’s soon bequeathed androgynous glam -rock, the Watergate scandal and the shallow opportunism of ‘Rollerball.’ Science-fictionism stalked the streets with a rejected furtiveness bred of cowering beneath the backdrop of the Cold War and dancing with the resurrecte d agonies of another Asian based imperialistic conflict. I fell through a crack in reality, having deliriously wandered amid the human wreckage and reached certain spiritual conclusions. In short, I do not know how I got there, but I know why. The 1970s w ere a dismal, incense -fuelled time that only those who lived through it can appreciate. The comprehensive dismissal of values and the adoption of pornography as the aesthetic standard by which all endeavour was to be categorised left its impressionistic fingerprints on everybody’s imagination, mine included. I guess that I analysed and reacted differently. That is how I escaped the mundane – through one of western society’s fault lines. Credo quia absurdum! I began dabbling in the black arts as an alienated university student . It was 1971 when I attended my first meeting – only to be led into an existence of happiness, sexual excess, acquisitive arousal and comfort . Within a week of meeting my Luciferian mentor I was operating a number of travel businesses in Sydney and flying to international destinations at least four times a year. I had a Jaguar, city apartment, holiday home in the country, access to a yacht on Sydney harbour and women. I was young and considered to be an up and coming star within the shadowy twilight of the Satanic infrastructure. The nether world was at my patent leather -soled feet. My suits were hand-make Italian; the cravats and neckties , Chinese silk and my nymphomaniac maids, French. (They dressed like French maids and would often wake me with a lesbian show.)

My life was one of calculated excess and dazzling fulfilment. I smoked handmade Partagas Cuban cigars. I had a personal secretary who was happy to engage my every whim and find like -minded others if I wanted a change or had a colleague I needed to impress. I finished every day with a restaurant meal, bottle of French Champagne and Black Mass orgy of unforgett able and unspeakable delight. The streets were more innocent, the people more naïve. The American Intelligence Services were still involved in funding the occult , but their influence was more ingratiating than dictatorial. In any event, many of America’s high -ranking military men were members of various Satanic Lodges or kindred organizations. Often sensitive materials and powerful figures – who operated from the comfort, safety and anonymity of the dark velvet shadows – were transported on US and Australian Navy ships . Oil tankers were another favourite. Materials (and indeed, people) have been concealed and lost on oil tankers for years. Remember, this was in the Seventies when America’s organized crime syndicates were establishing the narcotics markets of the Western World, Australia included. I knew her as Lilith, a High Priestess of an ultra-secretive Black Order of Typhon. Hers was the easy smile of a true neurotic and the body of an Angel. Her long cruel fingernails were enamelled in the chic and expensive titillations of her victims and their fantasies. Urolagnists worshipped at her feet and obeyed her every sadistic command. They were not the only ones. Her clientele included the top end of town and she frequented the boardrooms and bathrooms of pow er with an essence of mystery, wealth and alluring sluttiness that won her the attention and influence of very many. I had first met her at a stately home in an inner Sydney suburb at one of the regular Black Masses held to strengthen the bonds of lust, o ccult knowledge and perversion . There she was indulging the Devil’s faithful, teaching and being videoed for the 1970’s black -market that existed in underground extreme porn: bestiality, pedophilia , body wastes and pain. After her services ‘to the Dark Lord’ she told me over a reefer and through exhaustion that she was only 17 and had met the Master. He had given her a mission.

That group comprises some of the most educated, wealthy, corrupt and corrupting people that have ever existed. And they operate out of Sydney, Australia – but their influence is international. It transpired that she had been flown to the United States to be tutored and initiated into what was at that time, Anton LaVey’s underground Satanic sisterhood of professional women with an aptitude for carnality and a conscience to match: the ‘Ordo Cave Lupam.’ Her high school teacher – an Adept in the Black Arts – had spotted Lilith while she was still only a schoolgirl . Like all Satanists, he believed that truth and salvation could be found through the exploration of repressed human needs ; that pornography gave joy and joy gave strength. Through his dedication and perverse ability , he had secured her co-operation to begin her new education for her assigned task of political intrigue and influential debasement. After completing her ‘education’ with the OCL Lilith was tutored by an English gentleman who I knew as Pindar. I never met him, but I worship the true father of the statutory heir. His were the ‘Irish’ mysteries of degradation and when his name was ever mentioned Lilith would often laughingly sing, ‘...the rosy red cheeks of the little children .’ Lilith procured children to satiate the debased lusts of many Satanists. These were taken from single girls by promises, for a fee or occasionally, simple stolen . Babies were bred for their various purposes by ‘Broodmares’ – young unemployed girls who were paid to hand over their ‘produce ’. Sometimes this magical pornography was filmed; sometimes children died. Once you have seen a young child crucified 402 or a baby kicked to death you are and can never be the same again. The most disturbing aspect of the Black Masses held in Sydney was and remains the ease with which victims were and continue to be obtained and the lack of any effective interest by the police (although a number of Police Commissioners from various States were members of the Order ). This is not to suggest that Satanists are simply perverts or child killers. The Alpha-Lodge to which I was a member placed a great deal of emphasis upon Magic, both in theory and practice. Demons were evoked and dispatched ; sigils made and sacrifice and the letting of blood encourag ed. In this regard, many who bask in their own limited knowledge believe that Aleister Crowley is the father of modern manifestations of Satanism, but this is incorrect. Perhaps Crowley is the grandfather of modern left-hand path groups, but their stepfather is Peter James Carroll, the founder of the Chaos Magick School. There are a number of reasons for this and the various Black Lodges within Australia have developed from their early twentieth century reliance upon recruiting from fringe Masonic groups , through High Magick in the nineteen twenties, Low Magick in the nineteen sixties and seventies to their current prospective candidates from amongst Chaos Magick practitioners (who are generally young, ambitious, enthusiastic, energetic and destined by their lifestyle choices to the shadowy world of Satanism). A number of up-market Escort agencies in Australia and elsewhere are operated by Black Magicians. Yet brothels and pornography comprise only a small financial part of the International Satanic Empire. Most of the money comes from drugs (the CIA) , sophisticated blackmail, money lending and currency trading.

It was Henry Kissinger who pr oposed the use of fundamentalist Christianity to bring about war , firstly in the Middle East and then globally. In this he was aided by a number of American Presidents subsequent to Richard M. Nixon handing over the reins to Gerald Ford – who was always one of ours ! As the Headquarters of International Satanism is Sydney, Australia it is not surprising to learn that Norman Lindsay 403 – a former Magus of the Order – is considered a Satanic Saint. Indeed, there are a number of flourishing secret shrines dedicated to him and his memory throughout Australia and the United Kingdom. Every Equinox there are human sacrifices dedicated to him and the subtle but perverted influence his painting and children’s literature continues to have. (Similar shrines exist in America under H enry Kissinger’s authority, but he has altered both the structure and subtle ethos of the American Alpha Lodge Shrines.) It was Lindsay who taught that every political solution lead to more complex and involuted problems. He counselled that the public is not concerned with satanic manipulators but only with petty criminals and little issues which affect their insignificant lives directly . As the status quo is maintained by the masses, it gets heavier the deeper it sinks and the greater its fears. The people can’t succeed or achieve and so must sink deeper and hold on more strongly!

Have no fear! * * * Cult Caste System Traditional high-end Satanic cults are organised like a caste system. Membership in the upper hierarchy is attainable by birth only, like the aristocracy. One can’t marry or buy into the top classes. At the top of the pyramid sit the blue bloodlines headed by the Rothschilds. This ruling class is worshipped as demigods like the reverence shown for the Egyptian pharaohs. Beneath this class sit hundreds of ‘mortal’ family bloodlines that make up a kind of intelligentsia. This group is characterised as high IQ and are granted access to worldly success - so long as they play the game. If members of this class feel morally in conflict with the coven’s activities, this usually manifests as ‘mental illness ,’ and if they rebel against ‘the family’ they are disposed of. Below this ruling class sit a menagerie of coven members that constitute the anarchy. In Europe these members are bound by location. In a young country like Australia they are united by things such as nationality or interest. For example, we have entire covens of people with Scottish heritage. Another group which is on par with the Scottish is the recent influx of lower -class English coven members with common accents. Australia grants these lower -class people the opportunity to escape the British class system in which they are nothings. Another rising Australian trend is the lesbian covens. Then there are the bikie gangs who do the dirty work . I used to sing the following insult at these lower castes when they got out of line: IQ low, Bloodline none. Shit-kicking Coven scum . Conflict exists between the traditional Satanists and the modern self-styled covens. The lowest coven groups compete amongst each other for the unattainable power and status of the hierarchy whom they jealously despise.

Theirs is a familiar story, documented in Mark Aaron’s book War Criminals Welcome: Australia, a Sanctuary for War Criminals Since 1945. Mark Aaron explained in interview: Most of the war criminals who settled in Australia were not Germans or Austrians. They were people from Central and Eastern Europe, from the Ukraine, the Baltic States, the central European countries of Czechoslovakia, Croatia and Serbia... These people had done deals with western intelligence organisations, having given them intelligence were then secreted or allowed to go to third countries like Australia... 417 The Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Jersualem has a classification system whereby they rate (from A to F) how cooperative a country is with the process of locating, investigating and trying Nazi war criminals.

My father’s Australian issued birth certificate documents that by September 1962, the Holowczaks resided at 14 McAlister Avenue in Engadine, a small suburb within the Sutherland Shire, south of Sydney. Many refugees settled in an area which ran from ‘The Shire’ to Wollongong. This group carried Slavic, Germanic, or Anglicised versions of their former surnames. They worked, attended orgies, raped children, and worshipped their pagan gods together just like they did in Nazi occupied Europe. I grew up listening to ‘Pop’ entertaining me with stories about the ‘olden days’ in Poland, when he worked in ‘ the camp.’ ‘What did you do in the camp?’ I asked excitedly. ‘I trained the dogs.’ ‘What else did you do?’ ‘I killed the Jews.’ I was six. Who are the Jews? I puzzled, and w hat did they do wrong? The location of ‘the camp’ was proudly displayed at the entrance to their Engadine house. A plaque decorated with the name ‘LUBLIN’ in a quaint folk -art style was fixed to the ir front wall. Many inconsistencies and unexplained mysteries remain concerning my father’s family history. Peter Holowczak despised Jews, yet some of my perpetrators he associated with claimed to be Jewish. So, either those perpetrators were lying to cover up their crimes, or a certain type of Jewish heritage was considered acceptable. I am not convinced the l ow IQ Lithuanian woman who raised him, who looked and behaved nothing like my high IQ family, is his mother, but suspect she stole my father as a prop to escape Europe. A few things make me suspect my paternal line contains some kind of hidden Jewish ancestry: - My father used to tell people his mother was Jewish. - John Gittinger told me my paternal line was ‘Levite’ which somehow qualified me for priestess Grande Dame candidacy. - My real Polish grandfather once got drunk and told my cousin that his father, was Jewish. I doubt he would joke about being Jewish after living through the Holocaust and knowing the Nazis kidnapped his brother -in-law one night and murdered him in Auschwitz. - My paternal great-grandfather taught the violin, a Jewish instrument. - The Russian Jewish parents of my sister-in-law observed, my brothers were the spitting image of Eastern Europe an Jews. Ashkenazi Jews were expelled from the Mediterranean and settled in Poland in the 12th century. Research indicates the Ashkenazi maternal line is mainly European, while the male line is predominantly middle eastern. BoysTown I am a second-generation victim of ritual abuse at Engadine BoysTown, which was located next to St John Bosco church, and St John Bosco College .

While claiming to train the boys in a range of trades, the only instructor was a butcher. In 2002, Father Paul Gerard Barrett, priest and counsellor , was convicted of 100 accounts of pedophilia against six boys while vice -deputy principal at St John Bosco College in Engadine. The court heard Barrett photographed male and female students having sex. One of Barrett’s victims, a 13-year-old male student, was lured by a female teacher. Barrett and the female teacher plastered the boy with alcohol before raping him. Police never charged the female teacher . In 2008, Father Paul Raymond Evans was found guilty of 18 sex offences against seven boys committed while he worked at BoysTown in the 1970s and 1980s. Paul Evans was ordained as a Salesian Order priest in Regina Coeli Memorial Church in the nearby suburb of Beverly Hills where his relative, William Evans, was the first Parish Priest. Regina Coeli was built with donations from the US Army. In 2012, police informed me a taskforce had been assigned to covertly investigate an Engadine BoysTown pedophile ring. Had this investigation been publicised, many more victims would have come forward, because that is the typical response to public exposure. Despite the secrecy, v ictims reported 247 Salesian priests to the federal Royal Commission, many of whom operated at St John Bosco College and Engadine BoysTown . Engadine is wedged between a massive national park and 49,000 acres of bushland belonging to Holsworthy Barracks, an army base equipped with a military airport. Lucas Heights sits adjacent to Holsworthy and is the site of a 20-story underground CIA research facility and nuclear reactor . It is part of ANSTO ( Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ) which incorporated the CSIRO. Peter Holowczak was friends with a fellow Slavic refugee also named Peter. I knew him as the ‘dog breeder.’ He lived on acreage near ANSTO in Lucas Heights. His house, a small asbestos box, was well hidden from the main road. The entrance to his sandy driveway off Old Illawarra Road was flanked by multiple signs nailed to trees and posts, warning trespassers to keep out and beware of his dogs. The property contained multiple sheds including a sawmill and dog kennels. A petite , fit dark -haired man, he trained Doberman and Rottweiler dogs, and sold dogs to the NSW police. Peter Holowczak purchased his Doberman dogs from this man. My family had two Doberman dogs from this breeder, so I know the quality of his dogs. Helen was friends with another Lithuanian ‘refugee’ whose house was a short downhill walk away, in Fairview Avenue. Helen regularly attended Leonas Petrauskas’ Engadine Medical Centre which was a short uphill walk. Helen bore two sons in Australia and named them after their fathers. John, the only ginger -haired member of the family, was the bastard son of Helen’s supervisor at the Wool Mill in Marrickville which was owned and run by the Scottish Vicars family. Helen’s youngest son, David Ronald, was destined to be named ‘Romance’ until her Polish friend Raya Spakz convinced Helen that Australians do not name children or houses after literal events the way Polish people do . Peter thought David was his son and spoilt him until he left home at age 30 years. He knew John was not his and treated him indifferently. But he so resented and despised my father, he raped, beat, and tormented Dad until the kid left home at 13. Peter typically taunted my father while dishing up cabbage soup for dinner: ‘Meat for you, David..."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" 281 meat for you, John ...’ Then he turned to my father and hissed in Polish, ‘And none for you - you son of a pig !’ My real grandfather was not a pig. I travelled to Jelena Gora in Poland in 1990 to meet him and to my relief discovered Mitek Rylko to be everything the Holowczaks were not. My real ‘Jadek’ was smart, witty, ethical, classy, socially respected, and handsome. During the war he sided with the Polish resistance , instead of raping and murdering Jews in a death camp as Holowczak did. I was 15 years old when my family realised Peter Holowczak and his vile surname were alien to us. The bombshell was dropped during lunch, following the birth of my baby brother. Peter could not stomach the honour of having my new brother named after him. ‘Frank, ’ Peter began, ‘ I don’t like the way you treat Fiona.’ ‘But you treated me like that, ’ Dad huffed. ‘Yes, but you are Fiona’s father. I am not your real father.’ My father was nothing like P eter Holowczak and did not treat me the way the Holowczaks treated him. Unlike the Holowczaks, my father never sexually or ritually abused us. Dad suffers complex PTSD and DID due to his horrendous childhood . Consequently, he became violent after he started self -medicating with alcohol. On rare occasions Dad dissociated and supported my allegations against the Holowczaks and their pedophile network. He once blurted out to my mother in front of someone, ‘Everything Fiona says about Satanism and Sydney is true, but we just don’t tell her for her own good! Peter Holowczak was ritually murdered at Easter 1991. When Police delivered my father the solemn news, he began cheering and dancing around his front yard, singing loudly to the Wizard of Oz tune: Ding-dong! The bastard’s dead! The bastard’s dead! The bastard’s dead! Ding-dong! The fucking bastard’s D-E-E-E-E-A-D! Peter’s death certificate says he committed suicide by hanging . Yet Helen told my mother a different story : A group of men arrived at her home that morning and told her to go shopping. Upon returning home she found Peter hanging by a noose in their chicken pen. ‘YOU KILLED HIM!’ Helen screamed at me in her lounge room following Peter’s death. Uncle John, Aunty Anita, my mother, and my future husband were present. I was there to confront Helen about ‘ Pop’s ’ sexual abuse of me throughout my childhood. ‘But Mum, ’ Uncle John tried to explain, ‘ Fiona wasn’t even here when dad died!’ ‘YOU KILLED HIM!’ she insisted. What Nanna meant was, Peter was killed because of me. The cult killed Peter because he drove me away from Sydney. The cult had regular access to me from age 18 months until my parents moved 1000 kilometers north of Sydney when I was 12 years old after which I visited Sydney at least once per year until my 16 th birthday. I briefly lived with the Holowczaks during my first year of college but moved out after Peter began bullying me. I transferred to an interstate college and never looked back. "},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":" 282 ‘Plain Vanilla’ Peter Holowczak’s hanging triggered my implicit memories of incest. My ordeal began with two weeks of unprecedented vertigo and insomnia followed by dissociation during which I swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. I had never been suicidal before and had no intention of harming myself. The incident threw me into the mental health system where my memories surfaced spontaneously without the use of hypnosis. From my earliest memory, Helen Holowczak made me take baths with Peter and sleep in his room so he could rape me. Peter bribed me into silence by offering me Quick -Eze digestive lollies. He would also let me play with things from Nanna’s display cabinet, including a little tea-set which was made up of burgundy apples with faces on them and a miniature plastic tree with autumn-coloured leaves. I was three when Peter locked me in an old refrigerator in his detached garage, the type that could only be opened from the outside. He threw cockroaches and other bugs on me, closed the door, and laughed as I screamed in terror. On many occasions, Peter threatened to crush my little fingers in a vintage washing machine mangle. Peter Holowczak owned a Doberman dog that he commanded in German. The dog was bred by the man who lived on Old Illawarra Road and wore a thick black leather collar around its neck with the name ‘SATAN’ stamped on it in capital letters. Peter made me get on all fours while the dog raped me from behind. He masturbated while he watched this. On one occasion, in Peter’s bedroom, Peter sodomised my younger brother while the dog raped me. Pop’s favourite game was hunt and rape. He would tell me to run and hide, then set ‘Satan’ the Doberman onto me. On one occasion I hid in between garage shelving, the dog found and barked crazily at me. I had to hide well or else the dog would rape me, just like the Nazis trained their dogs to rape Jewish women. Peter said he learnt to train dogs while working in the Nazi camps. When I threatened to tell my parents what Pop was doing to me, he filled their concrete laundry tub with water, stood me on a wooden crate before the basin, grabbed my head by the hair and shoved it underwater. He held my head under until I almost drowned, then ripped it up again and hissed, ‘This is what will happen to you if you tell -...’ before plung ing my head back under. I was seven when Peter shoved my head into their outside unplumbed toilet . I vomited at the stench of raw sewerage while he sodomised me. I was eight when he inserted a dove’s head inside my vagina and held it there while it writhed and died. I was eight when Peter put me into a box that lay in a hole in ground beneath his house, the same location he pretended to bury the neighbour’s son three years earlier. He placed me in the box and told me I was going to die there, and then covered it up and left me there for hours. I was 11 when Peter took me up his back yard, behind the sheds that housed his bees, chickens, and pigeons. He showed me a huge pile of dead bees at the back. He pointed to something in the pile and told me to take a closer look. I leaned over the pile of dead bees when - he pushed me into it. Dead bees went all over me and through my clothes. I screamed hysterically while Peter laughed. Suddenly the back neighbour yelled over the fence at Peter,"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":" 283 ‘What are you doing to her?!’ Peter lied to the neighbour and said that I fell into the pile of bees. I vividly recall the day the incest ended. I had a loud fight with Peter, yelled a t him that Leonas Petrauskas ruled he was never to touch me again. Jan, the mother of my best friend Fiona LeCornu-Levett, interrupted and witnessed the argument when she arrived at the Engadine house to collect me. On our way to her Macquarie Fields home she repeatedly asked me, ‘ What was that about?’ but I evaded the subject. In 2018, the NSW state government determined on the balance of probabilities that Peter Holowczak did violently rape and physically assault me throughout my childhood. Victim’s Services awarded me the maximum compensation amount - $10,000. Luciferian Creed: ‘He Who Swords and Conquers for Baal’ Luciferian Ritual Abuse My memories of ritual abuse began with a vivid visual flashback of Peter Holowczak and his neighbour ritually murdering a three-year-old blonde boy on a table in the front room of 12 McAlister Avenue. The neighbour’s obese wife went insane and ‘committed suicide’ following years of miscarriages. Peter placed the child’s body in a coffin made of rough pine panels in a shallow mock grave beneath the west side of the Holowczak’s house. I did not realise at age five that they would later move the body. I attended rituals in the national park bushland surrounding the Sutherland Shire, in hidden basements, Freemason lodges (including Kidman’s lodge at 317 Pacific Highway, North Sydney) and multiple Roman Catholic churches including Engadine BoysTown , St John Bosco church, Regina Coeli Memorial Church in Beverly Hills, and a wooden Catholic church that used to exist east of Engadine train station. Jesuit-trained Leonas Petrauskas presided over"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":" 284 these rituals in which babies, children and adults were murdered in honor of their gods including Moloch/Molech, Baal, Dagon, Imhotep, Horus, Anubis, Thoth and Isis. My abusers seemed to have a god for every occasion, but Lucifer was lord of them all. I was six when the cult taught me what would happen if I disclosed their identities and activities to anyone. I was taken into the depths of the bushland. There I was forced to watch the cult chain each of a ‘traitor’s’ four limbs to a different vehicle. The four vehicles drove off in different directions as the man screamed then exploded into pieces. On my sixth birthday, I was dressed in a new red, long dress and my hair was gathered in a part ponytail tied with a red ribbon. My uncle drove Nana to collect me from my home at the end of Virginia Street, Padstow, and took me to national park land situated on the coast, between the Sutherland Shire and Kiama. I recall subtropical looking trees and foliage, and a picnic table laden with sweets and coloured cordial. A group of blonde children were gathered around the table. The cordial was laced with drugs. It was daylight when I drank the cordial. It was dark when I awoke naked, strapped to the picnic table. Men and women dressed in black robes took turns at creeping up to me and whispering chants and the names of demonic entities into my ear. Later that night, a group of men from the local hunting clubs arrived in pick -up trucks, dressed in caps and gingham shirts, carrying hunting and surveillance gear. The children and I were stripped naked. I was taken aside and instr ucted to take the children and hide them. Their lives were my responsibility, and if I failed - they would be killed. They painted something on my back before I briefed the children best I could. I had just turned six, but my mental age was far older. I de sperate ly told the children they were to run for their lives, stay as quiet as possible, and find somewhere far away to hide. A gun was fired to mark the start of the hunt. I shouted at the kids to run. I drove them from behind like a cattle dog and pushed them up over the first hill. We were halfway up the second hill when I heard gunfire . Kids began dropping around me. When I realised all hope was gone – I took off. I dissociated from the pain and ran for hours and miles over hill and dale, through the wild fauna. A search party did not find me until the following afternoon. In the summer of 1975, I witnessed a 12-year-old girl named Michelle gang raped by local BoysTown priests and hanged to death on a gum tree on the rocky bank of the Weir, a dammed section of Woronora River, next to Engadine. Michelle was slim and wore her long dark hair in a side ponytail. She was dressed in a red t-shirt and white shorts. Michelle was kidnapped as she walked along a major road, by a white car containing men whom she knew and trusted. I was seated in the back. I saw them offer her a laced sweet from a white paper bag. I later saw Michelle’s naked body hanging from a meat hook in a cold room on the grounds of Holsworthy Barracks. At age eight I suffocated during a rebirth ceremony at the abandoned Garrawarra Cemetery at Waterfall, south of Engadine. The cult lowered me onto a rotting corpse in an old grave and closed the lid. They chanted from the Book of the Dead as I screamed. I depleted the oxygen and passed out. I awoke in Sutherland Hospital on a metal table in a small internal room clad from floor to ceiling in blue tiles. An oxygen mask covered my mouth. Three people dressed in shower hats were silhouetted against a blinding overhead light. ‘We nearly lost you, ’ a nurse cooed. ‘ Mummy’s here.’"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" 285 Mummy!

When I was eight, Peter Holowczak forced me to watch the dog breeder tie down a female Doberman dog that I was fond of, chop its newborn pups in half, and chop the mother’s back legs off while it was still alive. They told me the same would happen to me and my brother if I ever disclosed. Peter dragged me along the g round by my hair and threw me into a cage , from where I was forced to watch the dog breeder fed human remains to his hungry dogs. At eight years of age I witnessed Leonas Petrauskas clean up after Prime Minister Paul Keating raped and murdered a five-year-old blonde boy on a beach at Kurnell. Keating panicked and buried the boy in a shallow grave. The following morning, police cordoned off the area while Petrauskas spoke with Keating who was dressed casually in board shorts. Petrauskas ordered me to dig up the body. Then he wrote a death certificate saying the boy was poisoned by a blue -ringed octopus. At age nine, I witnessed Leonas’ daughter Krista Petrauskas seduce a curly blonde - haired surfer into the bushes at a beach near Kurnell. While having sex with the man, Krista drugged him using a hypodermic needle. Later that evening, the Cult ritually murdered the young man on the beach.

Milat and the Slavic dog -breeder were what we called ‘ cleaners’ ; they did the dirty work, namely cleaning up and disposing of bodies. The bodies were usually fed to dogs. Any remains the dogs did not eat were dissolved in a large concrete bath in a shed on his property. Other bodies were cremated. These people dared not leave traces of evidence, upon threat of their lives Ivan Milat, Peter Holowczak, and Peter the dog-breeder regularly associated. I was six when they forced me to watch them feed live children through an industrial mincer. The victims’ remains were caught in a blue wading pool constructed of metal poles and plastic canvas. They threw me into the pool of blood and sludge at the end. I was 10 when they threw children off a cliff in the nearby bushland. I forget how old I was when they sliced a nine -year- old Down Syndrome girl in half on the dog-breeder’s bandsaw. After going public about these crimes, I was contacted by people who corroborated my memories to varying degrees. Police raided the Holowczak’s old house at 14 McAlister Avenue after it sold. During police investigations, the neighbour who owned the house next door at number 16 informed police that he had grown up in Engadine and exclaimed that much of what I described in my Candy Girl document fit his knowledge of the local area. He told police the dog breeder almost nabbed him and his mate as they rode past his house as children. I was also contacted by Dr John Melov’s son Peter who supported my testimony on social media. Peter Melov told me he personally had no abuse memories. So, my right hemisphere knowingly asked him one thing: ‘Did you own a Doberman dog. ’ At first, he could not recall his family owning a dog. I listened knowingly as it dawned on him. ‘Wait a minute!’ he gasped. ‘ We did have a dog!

Further, Stephen Masters pur chased a dog from the same breeder who relocated to 6 th Avenue West Hoxton following the government reclamation of his property to build New Illawarra Road. It was Stephen who remembered the dog breeder’s name was ‘Peter ’ and that he bred dogs for the NSW Police Force . The Cave rn A massive cavern system exists beneath Holsworthy which links up to ANSTO in Lucas Heights. I surmise this is a man-made extension of a natural system, constructed to covertly transport and store artillery during war. There is a cavern system beneath Engadine BoysTown which I suspect connects to the Holsworthy one , but can’t clearly recall. This cavern system houses multiple ritual sites and altars. At the BoysTown end sits a four ways intersection, plus a large bronze statue of Baal. The bull sits upright and holds a bowl filled with oil. A furnace beneath the bull heats the oil. At age 14, I was subjected to an abortion performed by Leonas Petrauskas with the assistance of his daughter Krista whom he trained as a lay nurse. They placed the young foetus in the boiling oil.

He pulled out teeth and then put them back in again, without anaesthetic. I recall being in a dingy room with a window high on the wall – like a basement.

Following this incident, I was disturbed by a Sesame Street film clip of a child visiting a dentist who told the child he had 20 strong white teeth.

Sydney Grande Dame Identified Researcher Steve McMurray located the identity of the Sydney Grande Dame I knew as 'Veronica' or 'Ronnie .' Here is the description I provided Steve : - Tall, attractive, slender, with red hair and white skin. - Extremely intelligent and academic . - Private school educated. - Kind with moral integrity . - Good at the arts: music, history, English and languages. - Associated with Sancta Sophia College , University of Sydney . - Graduated University of Sydney . - Her parents owned a property and horses west of Sydney. - I could not decide whether she was a schoolteacher, University of Sydney lecturer, or supervised the students at a girls' student college . - She died during a ritual at St Mary's Cathedral when she was 45 and I was age 14 years. Armed with this list to guide his sear ch, Steve McMurray identified Patricia Anne Conlon (nee Carden). I last visited Anne Conlon in her Sancta Sophia living quarters when I was 14 years old. Her dorm featured a lounge area, ensuite, and a four-post bed. We ate in the communal dining room where Anne passed me off as her niece.

This was ill received by Antony Kidman who coveted the position for his daughter Nicole. I heard from two independent sources that Nicole is male. That, plus her unimpressive IQ, would have rendered her ineligible for Grande Dame nomination. Volatile Rosalind Croucher also threw a tantrum at the news. She screamed that I was too young and demanded to know why I was chosen. She stopped mid-sentence and began to choke. She then collapsed to the floor, gasping for breath. ‘That’s why I chose her,’ Anne concluded, and we left. Anne Conlon and Janelle Kidman had associated for years due to the close relationship between their husbands. So, w e took tea with Janelle Kidman whom I despised. ‘Fiona has just returned from America,’ Anne tried to make polite conversation. ‘Oh really,’ Janelle feigned interest. ‘How did that go.’ Suddenly, Janelle’s teacup exploded into pieces. Anne chastised me as we drove away. I waited until she calmed down before I added, ‘Yeah, but it was funny.’ She smiled. ‘Yes, it was.’ Anne smiled once more, during a visit to a horse property north-west of Sydney, when I made a joke about her long chestnut hair being the same colour as the horse. The Ritualistic Transfer of Power Fritz Springmeier described the Grande Dame position as follows: As a child of the Illuminati progressed through its programming, three people had oversight over its programming: its Grande Mother, its Grande Dame , and the Programmer... The Illuminati method for killing a Grande Dame and passing her spiritual power on is done with reverence. No blood is to be spilled out of respect for the elderly woman who gives up her life willingly.

The Cathedral was packed full of dignitaries, politicians, entertainers and priests including Cardinal George Pell. The cathedral doors were heavily guarded by NSW police. The opulent evening ritual featur ed Bach organ music and a full choir. There I drew in Anne’s last breath and collapsed to the floor behind the altar, devastated. It was acceptable for me to show emotion on this special occasion because my grief proved the ‘good bond ’ between a Grande Dame and her apprentice . I quickly composed myself and strode numbly down the cathedral aisle to eerie Baroque music I now hate. The Backlash With Anne Conlon gone, I was fair game - just as I predicted.

I was led through a room full of noise, alcohol and people snorting cocaine on a coffee table in the corner. After the guests left , John Bell and Antony Kidman raped me in the loungeroom. Then they near drowned me in the pool. Kidman held my arms from behind while Bell danced like a monkey and plunged my head under with his foot.

Later, Janelle curtly handed me my freshly laundered clothes. Rosalind Croucher Rosalind Croucher studied law at Sydney University and specialised in private property law. She served as Acting Dean of the Sydney Law School, Deputy Chair of the University of Sydney Academic Board in 1999, Dean of the Macquarie University Law School, Chair of the Council of Australian Law Deans, Vice-President of the International Academy of Estate and Trust Law, and President of the Australian Law Reform Commission. In 2017, Rosalind Croucher commenced her seven -year tenure as P resident of the Australian Human Rights Commission . Her first act in that role was to defend a pedophile who lied on his job application to a major bank by not declaring his criminal conviction for child pornography. The bank consequently terminated his employment within the three -month probationary period. Croucher declared the termination a violation of the pedophile ’s human rights. Rosalind Croucher’s pro-pedophile stance is consistent with her violent sexual and physical abuse of me as a minor. Order of the Eagle Ritual, Bathurst 1985 Rosalind Croucher organised the Luciferian ritual held in Bathurst City Hall on 6 October 1985, during the weekend of the famous Bathurst 1000 car race. It coincided with the birthday of Richie Benaud, Australian sporting legend and television commentator. Leonas Petrauskas drove me and a blonde 15-year-old boy named Thomas to the event. Thomas was another ‘chosen one’ in training at Regina Coeli in Beverly Hills. We sat in the front row of the upstairs mezzanine in the hall which was packed with robed VIPs including the Bathurst Mayor, St Stanislaus College priests, and NSW police. The massive population increase in Bathurst due to the car race disguised the crowd who congregated for this event. A small group of robed Luciferians stood on the black stage: Rosalind Croucher, Richie Benaud, Kim Beazley Snr, Bruce Spence, and NSW Police Commissioner John Avery. A purple satin banner hung at the back of the stage. It was a rectangular shape and bore the Seal of Solomon. A large encircled spread eagle stood in the middle of the banner, its head locked to its right, its wings and legs were outstretched. The bird’s wings and claws fit three different invisible occult symbols: an encircled pentagram, an encircled hexagram, and the Freemason compass and square.

So, I made my way to the stage. ‘Let’s take you down a notch, ’ Croucher smirked at me. A decaying rat was forced into my face and I was ordered to take a bite. I briefly hesitated but complied. Then Bruce Spence violently raped me on the altar in front of the crowd. After this I took a seat in the front row and watched a group of naked, hypnotised children line up at the front of the stage. Spence decapitated them with a samurai sword, and the crowd broke out into a frenzied bloody orgy. Kim Beazley held a decapitated head of a girl to my face and smirked, ‘Take ye eat.’ Finally, Rosalind Croucher urinated in my mouth while I was gang raped. ‘You flinched!’ Petrauskas yelled at me backstage. ‘No,’ I lied. He led me to a back room to the right of the stage where Rosalind Croucher stood next to a mobile defibrillation unit. Petrauskas told me to sit in the chair. I obeyed . Then Croucher angrily began electrocuting me to the head. ‘Okay, that’s enough!’ Petrauskas warned her. Croucher trembled with rage and continued. She had organised the entire event as an act of revenge against me. ‘Stop!’ Petrauskas yelled, ‘ She is government property! You will get in big trouble! ’ Croucher persisted. I snapped. ‘Stand down, Soldier!’ Petrauskas ordered. Too late. I grabbed Croucher by the throat, lifted her off the floor , robotically turned my head toward Petrauskas and coolly stated: ‘ Leave us.’ Escaping the Cult Three key incidents provided legitimate grounds for my leaving the cult. The first was Kidman and Bell’s rape at their post-production party, the second was Croucher’s violent assault at Bathurst, and the third was when the ‘Light Man’ turned up mid-ritual. The latter incident in a basement beneath one of the churches, either Regina Coeli or St John Bosco; I get confused because their street layout is similar , but I err in favour of Beverly Hills due to its larger size. Whichever church it was, there was a home opposite it owned by a Christian family. The cult called genuine praying Christians ‘Lights.’ The cult held meetings to devise strategies for driving out the ‘Lights’ because their Christian presence and prayer spiritually disrupted the impact of the cult’s witchcraft. Large Catholic churches contain a second altar which sits directly beneath the public altar in an underground crypt. The stone crypt floor was lined with pews. I stood behind the altar, facing a room full of robed cult members. A baby lay face up on the altar, its head pointed to my right. I raised the ceremonial knife when – suddenly, white light flooded the room. I froze amidst the pandemonium of cult members diving beneath the pews, screaming, clasping their ears, and clawing at the floor to escape. ‘Fiona, ’ a voice spoke out of the light, ‘ Do you choose to do this?’ ‘NO!’ I screamed and dropped the knife. ‘ JESUS, HELP!!!’ I fle d. The usual guards were gone from the front of the church. I ran down the street and through the front door of the Christian family’s home where they sat in their loungeroom"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":" 296 watching television. Their faces looked like stunned mullets as I, fully robed and breathless, burst into their presence. ‘PRAY!’ I gasped and collapsed to my knees. The Luciferian cult has its own judicial system called the Grande Council which meet to determine serious issues such as whether a cult member ought to be put to death. I was not present for the hearings against Peter Holowczak or Antony Kidman, but their deaths have the tell-tale signs of a Grande Council determination. The Grande Council convened in the University of Sydney MacLaurin Hall. I was called to plead my case for leaving the cult. My desire to leave placed the cult in an awkward position since they could not simply replace a Grande Dame. Any new Grande Dame must draw in the dying breath of the previous one, and I had already taken that gig. The cult could not simply kill me, because I had to surrender my life willingly. I was unwilling. Besides, I was still a ‘National Asset’ as Gittinger said, in which governments jointly invested many millions. If it costs the government $1 million to train a regular soldier , i magine the cost of training a MK - DELTA child soldier. My defence consisted of a scathing attack on Antony Kidman and Rosalind Croucher and how they had placed their personal hatred of me before the collective good. If anyone ought to serve penance – they should. The cult had promised me the Grande Dame position carried a level of respect, privilege and self-determination – none of which had been afforded me. My trump card was the ‘Light Man’ incident. I spoke of how from my earliest memory, the cult taught me that ‘ The Order ’ and their gods were omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent. I challenged them: ‘My whole life you have told me that Lucifer is the most powerful being! Oh, yeah? Then who was that?!! WHO WAS THAT IN THE BASEMENT?! ’ Silence. ‘Until you can answer my question, ’ I pointed at the ceiling, ‘ I’m with HIM!’ They had no answer. Kidman broke the silence. ‘ And what will you do now, without us?’ I had plenty of natural talent to fall back on, I argued. ‘Like what, ’ Kidman asked. I listed off my interests and abilities. ‘There’s a piano, ’ he motioned to the nearby instrument. ‘ Play something.’ I began to play. Kidman approached, watched me for a moment – then slammed the piano lid onto my hands. He leant on my trapped fingers, plunged his contorted face in mine, and spat: ‘ You will NEVER amount to ANYTHING without US!! ’ True to his word, the cult has harassed me my entire life , thwarted my every attempt to find a place in society, sabotaged my every interest, passion, and pursuit, until I eventually ran out of options and energy .

I mean, couldn’t you tone it down a bit? Think of something less confrontational?’ Me: ‘ Nope. ’ Six months later, my friend phoned again. Her countenance had shifted.

You write that book - and you keep that fucking title !’ While it’s perfectly acceptable for Australians to brag about their kids’ selection for elite sporting teams, the very mention of a child’s intellectual superiority invariably incurs criticism and victimisation from everyone, particularly schoolteachers. Australians are so entrenched in ‘tall poppy syndrome, ’ I have attracted criticism for daring to suggest that I was the victim of an elite pedophile ring . Oh, ELITE you say! So, you’re not good enough to be abused by just any old pedophile ring . Yours must be an ELITE one! So, you can well imagine the criticism I copped for trying to explain the relevance of intelligence within the context of the MK -ULTRA selection process. The snidest criticism came from lawyer Michael Salter, self -appointed expert on ‘complex trauma and organised sexual abuse’ who worked for a n ALP politician before parachuting into the DID industry with no relevant qualification: We have a different standard regarding the public domain and publishing what you are unable to prove. Like saying that you have different brain structure. This reduces your credibility. Intelligence is the most important variable to understand when trying to fathom the MK-ULTRA mind control selection and programming process. Every victim of mind control I know was chosen based on their IQ level. It is important for the reader to understand there is nothing e litist about being highly intelligent, nor about merely discussing the topic of intelligence. I will now discuss the psychology behind this phenomenon. Set aside your understanding of intelligence. You were taught the smartest people got dux at school, graduated university, were awkward nerds who became doctors and lawyers, right? Wrong.

Intelligence Defined The military and secret services employ the traditional, scientific definition of intelligence as determined by comprehensive psychometric testing. Standardised tests of cognitive ability were initially designed for military recruitment purposes during the first world war. The armed forces and secret services have incorporated these tests in their selection processes ever since. For instance, former CIA case officer Philip Agee 419 described undergoing a battery of vocational, aptitude, and personality tests including: the Stanford- Binet, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Strong Interest Inventory, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Guilford’s Structure of Intellect, Kude r Occupational Interest Survey, and the Rorschach inkblot test. Francis Galton, Lewis Terman, Letta Hollingworth, and Charles Spearman pioneered an evidence -based approach to the study of intelligence. Terman produced the Stanford- Binet intelligence test. Spearman created math formulae to identify a general innate 419 Phillip Agee (1975). Inside the Company: CIA Diary . Penguin."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":" 300 component of intelligence ( g ) within this and later IQ tests. Terman and Hollingworth distinguished characteristics common to children who scored within the ‘giftedness’ ranges on the Stanford Binet. Discrimination between the highest intelligence levels is crucial because members of each IQ category share similar learning and psychological characteristics, capabilities, and needs. The resultant, recognised giftedness categories are: - Moderately gifted (IQ 130 to 144) - Highly (IQ 145 to 159) - Exceptionally (IQ 160 to 179) - Profoundly (IQ 180+). To provide context, the average IQ is 100, the average IQ of a school teacher is 110, and the average IQ of a doctor or lawyer is 120. An intelligence quotient of 120 is simultaneously the optimal IQ for academic achievement within a traditional school classroom. In other words, the average doctor or lawyer is not even moderately g ifted. These fundamental findings were later undermined by Renzulli, Sternberg and Gardner who fostered today’s popular misconception that everybody is gifted when compared to a long-enough shopping list of possible talents. The idea that everybody is gif ted forces everybody into the far -right tail of the normal distribution curve – a mathematical impossib ility. Modern psychologists and educators deny the notion of innate intelligence. They treat intelligence as nothing more than a person’s acquired knowledge and skills. According to their conception of intelligence, differences between individuals’ IQ scores stem from variation in environmental opportunity for acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary for performance on standardised intelligence tests. 420 This is a Marxist based fallacy. As we explore in this chapter, military intelligence and secret service recruitment processes are based on the premise that intelligence is genetically predisposed and environmentally enhanced. In other words, people who lack the genes can’t be nurtured into a genius. The army is not interested in warm egalitarian concepts delivered by Marxist university professors. The military simply want to know what works in the field, and whether they can trust Freddie with a tank. Attributing individual differences in intelligence primarily to environmental factors - as mainstream educators and psychologists do - is like saying a natural brunette can change into a natural blonde without hair dye. Individual differences are genetically determined. Just as we inherit individual differences in hair colour, facial features, body type , and health issues from our ancestors, so we inherit differences in brain structure and function. Intelligence is the product of variation in brain structure, and a function of how fast our brains work due to this variation. High IQ individuals share different brain structure and function compared to people with average IQ. Researchers are consistently proving that the brains of individuals who score highly on standardised intelligence tests are denser , more interconnected, and possess 420 Arthur R. Jensen (1993). Why Is Reaction Time Correlated with Psychometric g ? Current Directions in Psychological Science , 2 :2, April, 53- 56."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":" 301 greater neural integrity. These factors create faster brain impulses, allow ing high IQ people to react to (i.e., process) sensory input more quickly. Intelligence is the product of variation in brain structure , a function of how fast our brains work due to this variation . Processing Speed Eugenicist Francis Galton of the Darwin-Huxley-Wedge wood dynasty was the first to hypothesise that variation of sensory discrimination and speed of response to stimuli would reflect intelligence differences. 421 He measured thousands of subjects’ reaction time to visual and auditory stimuli. Yet his conclusions regarding intelligence were publicly rejected as too simplistic. A modern reprise of Galton’s research into reaction time and IQ differences have yielded results consistent with his original hypothesis. Numerous studies conducted globally prove that people with higher IQs are quicker at processing sensory stimuli. For example, a metanalysis of 14 studies conducted between 1884 to 2004, including one study by Galton, showed reaction time (which reflects a person's mental processing speed) indicates general intelligence. 422 A 2008 metanalysis of 172 studies, with a total of over 53,000 participants, found IQ to be correlated with mental speed, and concluded that phenotypic correlations between IQ and mental speed are attributable to correlated genetic factors. 423 A 2013 study showed that people with higher IQs have quicker reflexes and make faster perceptual judgments. 424 Modern research is increasingly employing brain scans to reach similar conclusions. A 2009 study used Diffusion Tensor Imaging to compare neural integrity in 92 pairs of fraternal and identical twins. Results showed that faster processing speed is correlated with higher IQ, and that processing speed is genetically determined. 425 This study produced a strong correlation between the thickness of myelin (the insulation that coats neural wiring in the brain) and performance on the Weschler IQ test. The thicker the myelin, the faster the brain transmits messages, and the faster the brain processes sensory input. This research showed myelin integrity to be an inheritable determinant of IQ. A 2012 study pooled brain scans and genetic data from 21,000 subjects scattered around the world, to find evidence of a g enetic link to brain function and IQ. 426 A 2015 study used fMRI analysis to find a correlation between cognitive ability and greater connectivity between brain regions involved in higher -level cognition. 427 Another 2015 study (of 126 421 Arthur R.

A similar 2017 study employed R-fMRI data to accurately identify individuals, and significantly predict higher cognitive performance, based on their brain connectivity. 429 The latter two studies refute criticism of the notion that gifted individuals possess different brain structure , as they show that everyone has different brain structure . fMRI scans show - everyone has different brain structure . IQ Tests Work Properly administered, comprehensive IQ tests measure exactly what the pioneers of intelligence research designed them to. Lewis Terman adapted the Stanford Binet from its French predecessor, to identify intellectual giftedness. His subsequent 1960 version, the Stanford Binet L-M, is unmatched in its ability to recognise visual-spatial pre-schoolers. It also remains the only test which can identify the top two categories of intellectual giftedness. David Wechsler’s IQ test series (WAIS and WISC) are commonly employed by educational psychologists to identify academic giftedness. This is problematic because these tests were designed to identify intellectual disability , not ability. Bright kids often obtain false negative results on the WAIS (by as much as 30 IQ points) because they are timed and extremely boring. The problem with timing is it thwarts the gifted individual’s characteristic thinking style and their consideration of all response alternatives. Hence Working Memory and Processing Speed scores are usually invalid and therefore ignored by specialist examiners. Giftedness guru Linda Kreger Silverman asserts that gifted children score highest in the three WISC index areas most heavily loaded for abstract reasoning: Verbal Comprehension , Visual Spatial , and Fluid Reasoning . She also recognises the Wechsler’s one outstanding advantage: Block Design is the single best IQ measure of visual-spatial ability. Comprehensive IQ tests like the Wechsler and Stanford-Binet provide an indication of brain laterality. They measure and compare the functioning of the two brain hemispheres and yield scores for Auditory-Sequential versus Visual-Spatial processing. The assessor looks for discrepancy between these two main scores when searching for cognitive deficiency. As a simple example (because test analysis gets extremely complex), a person who scores normally on the visual-spatial test items but significantly lower on auditory -sequential tasks may suffer an auditory processing problem. Conversely, someone who scores normally on auditory items but too low on visual items may have a visual processing impairment. Based on these results, kids may be prescribed educational interventions, or referred to relevant specialists for further assessment and treatment. Ignorant educators typically label IQ tests ‘elitist’ when their main use is identifying developmental and other disorders that hinder learning. 428 E.S. Finn et al. (201 5).

"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":" 303 Brain Laterality After grasping the concept of intelligence, the next important variable to understand is brain laterality . The brain is divided into two main hemispheres, left and right. Lateralization of hemispheric functioning means one hemisphere dominates the other while processing incoming stimuli. Stimuli are detected by five major senses (vision, hearing, taste, smell, and touch) and two lesser known ones (proprioceptive and vestibular). Psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist wrote a book that provoked a paradi gm shift in the world of neuroscience. 430 Based on an extensive literature review, he identified the autonomous roles of each brain hemisphere, thereby dispelling the myth that language processing is localised left, and imagery right. McGilchrist’s thesis is that the hemispheres perform complemen tary yet conflicting roles. Sensory input enters the right hemisphere, is sent to the left for processing, and returns to the right for a new synthesis. This process is mediated by the corpus callosum. Split-brain cases studies, where the corpus callosum is surgically severed, indicate the two hemispheres are capable of independent thoughts, feelings, sensations, memories, desires, and will. The author recognises that brains of normal individuals may show bias toward one or the other hemisphere. Right Hemisphere : ‘Dr Jekyl’ The right hemisphere is larger and more connected compared to the left. It is sensitive to testosterone and noradrenalin, and it regulates the heart and blood pressure in response to emotion. The right sees things holistically and in context. It takes a broader perspective, including the left hemisphere’s content. It is primarily interested in living things, and things external to itself. The right is capable of compassion, empathy, altruism, and morality. It is flexible to change and deals with new information. The right can espouse another’s perspective. It understands humour, metaphor, sarcasm, sadness, and regulates tears. It processes music and art. It is better at science and math problems and has a broader, more sophisticated vocabulary. The right brain is responsible for processing all aspects of emotion except anger. It reads micro facial expression, body language, detects deceit, resists the usual train of thought, perceives anomaly, and questions authority. It applies common sense. The right hemisphere is the seat of creativity and interest in God. It is better at maintaining four of the five types of attention, vigilance, alertness, sustained, and divided attention. The right better integrates sensory input , and carrie s information on touch, pain, and body position. The right brain has longer working memory. It also contains episodic memory , which is memory for personal experience and emotions. The right synthesises complex information, perceives complex visual or conceptual patterns, and can make connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of information. The right appreciates uniqueness and individuality , and is concerned with the personal, and what exists apart from us. It has a sense of the past and future , and so can fore see consequences and make predictions. The right hemisphere is near impossible to silence. 430 Ian McGilchrist (201 9).

It can’t see the whole, or the bigger picture. Its narrow perspective ignores right brain content. The left hemisphere is only interested in public domain facts. It can’t cope with new information, interprets everything according to existing knowledge, and denies discrepancies that do not fit the established paradigm. It deals with linear, sequential pieces of information. It sees things as fixed and equivalent. It labels, types, categorises, collects, and organises things. It compartmentalises things in classes that make no sense. It processes basic arithmetic yet can’t solve complicated math or science problems. The left brain is incapable of imagination or creativity and can’t deal with novelty or unpredictable situations. Only after something new has been repeated and becomes overfamiliar and lifeless does it pass to the left hemisphere for storage. The left brain has a limited vocabulary of simple, highly related words. It does not perceive humour, irony, metaphor, or any complex language features. It exhibits only one of the five types of attention - focussed. The left brain is preoccupied with man-made, inanimate objects, and machines. It does not appreciate poetry, music, or beautiful realistic art. It is only interested in abstract art that is depersonalised and breaks living things into unrecognisable parts. The left brain can’t recognise emotion or body language. It is incapable of eye contact, and only sees the mouth. The left has no social skills, no empathy, no sense of Theory of Mind (the ability to place oneself in another’s position and imagine what that person is thinking ). The left brain lacks common sense. Fuelled by dopamine, it is preoccupied with sex and food. Having no sense of the future or of consequences, the left settles for instant gratification. The left hemisphere cares nothing for others, has no conscience, and is incapable of feeling guilt. Ange r is its only emotion. The left brain is capable of malice, manipulation, lying, and wilful denial. It seeks power and control. It sees people as objects of use, or prey. The left brain is passive and easily silenced. "},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" 305 Left -Brained Society Western Society is increasingly being dominated by left hemispheric processing and the suppression of right hemispher ic ability. This shift is disturbing considering the left brain’s intellectual limitations and capacity for evil. Operating in isolation, the left brain exhibits every negative human quality that is poisoning our society: it is selfish, deluded, superficial, dysfunctional, egotistical, psychopathic, narrow-minded, atheistic, and plain dumb. The dominance of left hemispheric processing has implications for science, medicine, psychology, education, government – everything. Communis m is the perfect example of left-brain indoctrination and right-brain suppression. When the right hemisphere functions abnormally, the left takes its place. This problem is associated with various DSM diagnoses including autism and psychopathy, two groups incapable of empathy and motivated by their desire to control. When left -brain dominant people assume positions of power within education, medicine , law or the secret services, the results are what we see manifesting in this increasingly permissive and perverse society . Indeed, white -collared psychopaths administer a hierarchy of mindless, easily silenced left - brain minions within every area of Australian government . Rock the boat within any sector and you will surely experience the manifestation of the Black Network . Implications for Victims Left-Brain Education System. Schools and universities teach to the left-brain and reward left-brain learning responses. Extreme left-brain functioning is the optimal learning style required for success, which explains why individuals with high-functioning autism excel in this environment. Law and medicine are the pinnacle course s that successful high school graduates aim for and yet these do not screen for unmanaged autism. Science is particularly saturated with individuals who have autism and whose right hemispheres simply do not work. People who operate solely from the left brain see those who use their right brain as a source of threat or discomfort that they try to manage or silence altogether. The incidence of autism is increasing exponentially, so expect a future society void of right-hemispheric processing ability. Left-Brain Health Industry. Health professionals are a product of left-brain academia. This partly explains why health professionals deny the effectiveness of new, innovative, and sometimes alternative mental health assessment and treatment methods. It accounts for why doctors present as cold, inflexible, and lacking the empathy and insight essential for understanding and treating complex cases of extreme abuse . It reveals why psychiatrists rely on medical equipment, rigid diagnostic classification systems, and unquestioning drug prescription. The psychiatric industry rigidly adheres to an outdated and disproven theory that all mental health problems stem from a biochemical imbalance. The DSM was based on this theory. The mental health industry is still preoccup ied with labelling patients according to the DSM and making patients take drugs which are proven to perpetuate depression and other mental health conditions. Even if a patient’s symptoms do not fit the listed classifications, that patient will certainly be stuffed into one or more inappropriate DSM categories. The diagnoses invariably escalate over time until the patient is eventually labelled Borderline"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":" 306 Personality Disordered and therefore unfixable. Psychiatry focuses on what is wrong with the patient instead of what has happened to cause their distress. Psychiatry forbids consideration of alternative causes of patient symptomology, and psychologists operate under the jurisdiction of psychiatry. Being obsessed with lists of rules and set procedures , the left-brain health administrators invariably punish dissidents who dare apply right-brain consideration to their assessment and treatment approach. Being obsessed with power and control, doctors commonly abuse their authority to punish staff and brigh t victims who refuse to comply with their ineffective and harmful treatments. Such patients are typically labelled ‘noncompliant’ and said to lack insight. The patients can then be labelled a danger to themselves and society. They are then sectioned, or placed on community treatment orders, and forced to take drugs which have been proven to have detrimental side effects such as uncontrollable shaking, Parkinson symptoms, and a 25-year reduction in life expectancy. McGilchrist notes: MPD, BPD, schizophrenia, anorexia, and self -harming are all characterised by dissociation, hypnotisability, left hemispheric hyperactivity , and a suppressed right brain. Interesting ly, victims of extreme abuse are misdiagnosed with those very DSM labels. The author made relevant connections but missed the right-brain bigger picture : (a) unethical hypnosis is used to cause dissociation and split -personalities within victims, and (b) schizophrenia, anorexia, and self-harming are symptoms of extreme abuse. According to McGilchrist, processing of new information occurs in a RIGHT → LEFT → RIGHT hemispheric sequence. New stimuli enter and are ‘grounded’ in the right hemisphere . The stimuli then pass to the left for - I surmise - comparison to previous experience, labelling, sequencing, and basic language application. McGilchrist says the information is then returned to the right brain for integration and storage. In mind control victims, the brain hemispheres are intentionally split, the left hemisphere is suppressed, and stimuli are prevented from being processed by the left hemisphere ; resulting in the trauma symptomology we will explore later . RIGHT → LEFT → RIGHT Brain Processing Orde r. Implicit Processing The author’s discussion of the right hemisphere’s capacity for implicit processing is a crucial consideration for MK-ULTRA and MK-DELTA victims who were specifically selected based on their right hemispheric processing ability . McGilchrist states: In fact, reasoning is of different kinds, and though linea r sequential argument is clearly better executed by the left hemisphere, some types of reasoning, including deduction, and some types of mathematical reasoning, are mainly dependent on the right hemisphere. More explicit reasoning is underwritten by the left hemisphere, less explicit reasoning (such as is often involved in problem solving, including scientific and mathematical problem solving) by the right hemisphere. There is a relation between the pleasurable ‘aha!’ phenomenon of insight and the right amygdala, which mediates interactions between emotions and higher frontal cognitive function. In fact , an"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":" 307 extensive body of research now indicates that insight, whether mathematical or verbal, the sort of problem solving that happens when we are, precisely, not concentrating on it, is associated with activation in the right hemisphere... When teenage science prodigy David Adair met Stephen Hawking, Hawking asked Adair for the source of his mathematic formulas. Adair reluctantly admitted that most of his solutions came to him in dreams. Stephen Hawking then replied, ‘I get a lot of my ideas through dreams also. We dream on the same wavelength.’ This demonstrates the right brain’s implicit (unconscious) processing ability. Implicit problem solving commonly occurs during a relaxed, wakeful state in high IQ individuals, such as during creativity which is a mild dissociative state. Implicit reasoning explains how someone instantly produces the answer to a complex question but can’t explain how they got there . ‘I just know, ’ is their typical response . This is because they do not consciously know, since their right hemisphere processed the problem unconsciously. Implicit processing ability is characteristic of highly intelligent indiv iduals with a visual-spatial learning preference. The higher the IQ, the more pronounced the implicit processing ability. I will now explain how perpetrators screened for implicit processing ability in MK - ULTRA and MK -DELTA candidates. Visual-Spatial Learners Because peoples’ brains are wired differently, they process incoming stimuli differently. These processing differences have been observed by measuring Alpha and Beta brainwave activity during cognitive tasks. These studies show that people of average IQ typically rely on the left hemisphere when performing cognitive tasks, and the left side is activated during these tasks. Owing to greater brain connectivity, both brain hemispheres are activated when high IQ individuals perform cognitive tasks. Highly intelligent people also show dominant Alpha activity in the right brain hemisphere during processing. 431 Within the specialist field of giftedness education and educational psychology, those who favour their left brain during cognitive processing are called Auditory-Sequential Learners (ASLs) while those who favour their right, or are bilaterally activated during processing, are called Visual -Spatial Learners (VSLs). Owing to left hemisphere dominance, ASLs tend to think in words, they respond best to e ducational content presented in sequence with a reliance on rote learning, phonetic language acquisition, written text, and simple verbal explanation. This group are good at reading a textbook from start to finish, focussing on the class teacher, and regurgitating rote content in exams. However, this group can’t understand what they learn. Contextual understanding relies on right hemispheric activation, which they simply do not have. ASLs comprise most students. The ASLs who perform optimally in this traditional classroom (which is geared exclusively to ASLs) typically gain the top university entry scores. Successful students learn by rote memory but can’t understand what they learn. 431 A. Jahidin et al. (2013). Asymmetry Pattern of Resting EEG for Different IQ Levels, Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences , 97, 246 -251."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":" 308 According to McGilchrist, deductive reasoning activates the right hemisphere’s visual areas in the absence of visual stimuli. Activation of the right hemisphere allows the gifted group to think in pictures. Hence, when you verbally describe something to a high IQ VSL, if they are interested in what you say, and are focused on your content, they will immediately convert your words into a movie in their head. Your words will then be permanently stored in this visual format, and the listener will never forget what you told them. This is called eidetic memory. You might know it as photographic memory. The higher the IQ, the more pronounced this ability. I once asked a successful lawyer what separates average from exceptional lawyers. ‘Photographic memory!’ he quipped. The ability to visualise makes right hemispheric learning and processing far superior. The advantage to quickly recalling relevant legislat ion and cases is obvious. Additionally, the gifted individual’s lateral thinking ability serves them well in statutory interpretation. Owing to their superior right brain functioning, gifted individuals only need to learn a concept once to understand and permanently remember it. This assists rapid knowledge acquisition. Yet high IQ’s must understand something in order to learn and memorise it. Hence, intelligent kids incessantly question everything. They are independent, lateral thinkers who make the best leaders. Intellectually gifted students prefer a holistic learning approach which starkly contrasts traditional schooling methods based on auditory-sequential repetition and phonetics. If permitted to learn the way their brains are wired to, exceptionally gifted children typically complete high school or university before their age peers finish primary school. Stanford University run a special school program for children who score IQ 145+ on the Wechsler or SB5, where they can do university level work from age five years. I know because my daughter was enrolled in their distance education program. Australian students who score IQ 130+ on comprehensive measures are neglected educationally and psychologically. Consequently, they drop out of school mentally by Grade 3, and physically before high school graduation. The brightest students typically do not pursue tertiary studies in law or medicine. This well contributes to why most doctors and psychiatrists are ignorant and ineffective when it comes to working with victims of extreme abuse . It also explains why so many surgeons are butchers, since surgical skill requires high right brain visual-spatial processing ability . Generally, doctors are only good at following a sequential set of steps, such as anaesthesiology, but are quite useless, even dangerous, when faced with novel situations. Doctors are particularly susceptible to the Dunning -Kruger Effect, a cognitive bias in which peop le of average IQ have illusory superiority and mistakenly assess their intelligence level as greater than it is. They come to the field of medicine assuming they already possess all they need to know, when their average IQ level prevents them from understa nding more complex concepts and discovering a whole body of information that sits outside their left- brain capacity and knowledge base . Creativity Creativity is not synonymous with intellectual giftedness, meaning a person can be gifted and not so creative, or creative and not gifted. This puzzles me since creativity is"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":" 309 associated with the right hemisphere, and high IQ people exhibit such high activation in this area. Highly intelligent people can produce different profiles where they score higher on left or right brain tasks. And people can be right brain dominant without being high IQ. So, I deduce creativity has to do with right hemispheric activity . Lewis Terman defined genius as an individual who measured IQ 180+ on the Stanford Binet. CIA psychologist John Gittinger considered genius to be a combination of exceptionally high IQ plus extremely high creative ability . The creative and gifted child who scored profoundly on visual -spatial test items was the CIA’s prime mind control target. The ‘creative genius ’ was the ideal candidate for the range of CIA programs including MK -DELTA and Stargate which I discuss later . Until recently, it has been impossible for mainstream psychologists to test creativity, because no one had defined the variable ‘creativity’ such that it can be operationalised and psychometrically tested. Mainstream scientists are only now starting to publish evidence of what I was mocked for saying years ago, that the CIA used brain scanning to assess victims for creativity. For example, a 2018 study used fMRI scans to show that creative thinking ability is characterized by a distinct brain connectivity profile. 432 Resear chers reliably predicted an individual’s ability to generate original ideas, from the strength of functional connectivity within a brain network associated with creative ability. Sensory Processing Disorder Their unique brain structure and function enables high IQ individuals to receive and process greater amounts of sensory input at once. Gifted people can detect and respond to sensory stimuli more quickly. They can think more complex and abstract thoughts, scan visual images quicker, detect visual and cognitive patterns, and make connections between seemingly unrelated bits of information. They can read micro facial expressions and body language, perceive what others are thinking, and accurately predict their responses. These abilities make high IQ individuals good at researching, detecting, code breaking, and intelligence gathering. Their quick reflexes and superior hand-eye coordination allow them to control a speeding vehicle and reverse a trailer with high accuracy. Their superb memories and auditory processing capacity allow them to function as human tape -recorders and to rapidly acquire foreign languages. In a military setting, their high visual -spatial processing IQ scores flag them as potential elite sniper squad recruits. Combine sup erior reaction time, hand-eye coordination, physical strength, agility, sniper skills, physical fitness, and a whole lot of ability enhancement via brainwashing – and you have a potential super soldier. This might explain why the CIA targeted high IQ visua l-spatial learners. Unfortunately, that which enables gifted individuals to perform impressive cognitive tasks is the same thing that makes them hypersensitive to sensory stimuli. The higher the IQ, the greater the sensitivity to light, noise, touch, smell, taste, and emotional stimuli. Such sensitivity has been labelled a developmental condition, Sensory Processing Disorder . SPD contributes to why gifted people often turn to drugs and alcohol, to subdue the constant overwhelming barrage of sensory input. 432 R.E. Beaty et al. (2018). Robust prediction of individual creative ability from brain functional connectivity, PNAS, Jan 30, 115:5, 1087 -92."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":" 310 Note that people on the autism spectrum are also prone to SPD. While they share hypersensitivity and certain cognitive abilities, autism must not be confused with giftedness. Remember McGilchrist’s observation that these developmental disorders feature prof ound right hemispheric abnormality. In stark contrast, gifted individuals demonstrate exceptional right hemispheric functioning. Yet ignorant and jealous health professionals routinely misdiagnose intellectual giftedness as high-functioning autism. Extreme visual-spatial processing ability renders gifted individuals susceptible to PTSD, and this can confound diagnosis. The high IQ victim is so sensitive that merely hearing a traumatic story second-hand affects them as though they witnessed the event first -hand. They turn the verbal rendition of the event into an internal movie so that the traumatic scene is permanently stored in memory and may be replayed. Their right hemisphere repeatedly plays an internal movie of a trauma incident. This hypersensitivity makes the trauma-based nature of mind control programming especially painful for high IQ victims. Fundamental brainwashing techniques involve overwhelming the victim’s nervous system with sensory stimuli. Sensory overload is achieved via the parallel infliction of loud screeching sounds, foul smells, electrocution, and forcing the eyelids open to view horrific images. Gifted individuals have a greater capacity for empathy, to picture themselves in others’ shoes, and anticipate how others might feel, think, and respond in a situation. This tendency to over -empathise also contributes to the gifted individual’s sensory ove rload. Their capacity for empathy makes the sight of tortured animals and children extra painful. Their empathic nature places victims at risk of revolting against their handlers, which is why CIA perpetrators focus on breaking the individual’s innate conc ern for humanity and redirecting loyalty toward cult members and fellow soldiers within their Delta units. Evil Genius Some people get flowers and chocolates as tokens of their partner’s affection. I received dusty old IQ tests. In 2009, my husband began purchasing redundant IQ assessments on eBay. I found Jon’s latest spending spree mildly amusing, like the time someone broke my favourite tea pot, and Jon made five eBay purchases before he attained an exact replacement. The various first edition Stanford Binet tests meant nothing to me, and I didn’t quite understand what Jon’s intention was - until it arrived. A mint condition SB L-M. I opened the box, took a brief look at its gleaming contents and sank into shock. I ran my fingers over the familiar pieces as my being was instantly transported back to 1974. ‘I know this...’ I whispered, overwhelmed by validation. ‘ You found it . ’ Tears welled in my eyes. ‘ You found my test...’ I was assessed on the SB L -M combined with the Wechsler Block Design when I was five years old. The optimal time to test for high intelligence is when the child is old enough to concentrate and understand, but prior to entering school where the highly variable quality of education acts as a confounding variable. Head CIA psychologist John Gittinger assessed me at Holsworthy Army Base. Gittinger was the greatest psychometric testing expert the world has never known. An expert in interrogation and brainwashing , Gittinger served as the CIA’s first operational psychologist, travelling the globe, collecting and advising on MK -ULTRA mind control"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":" 311 methods. That is why he travelled to Australia and supe rvised my brain washing and reprogramming. With CIA funding, Gittinger developed the PAS (Personality Assessment System), the most complex, versatile psychological test ever created. Mainstream psychologists are blind to the very existence of the PAS, nev er mind its staggering scope. The test was scarcely mentioned in my psychology textbooks which presented it as a mainstream tool for educational, vocational, and clinical work. The PAS was in fact the CIA’s template for creating multiple personalities within child victims of mind control. The intelligence sector used the PAS to: - Profile targets for recruitment as CIA agents; - Profile politicians, entertainers and businessmen for blackmail and control by identifying their weaknesses (e.g., sexual proclivity and perversion); - Profile whistle -blowers for tailored harassment methods; - Tailor interrogation or torture methods to personality types; - Profile international leaders and citizens in preparation for CIA infiltration and overthrow of their governments; - Selec t candidates for psycho-energetic CIA programs including Remote Viewing, Project Stargate, and the Gateway Process; - Profile international secret police; - Identify suitable child prostitute and soldier candidates. - Tailor the creation of multiple personalities to a victim’s hemispheric processing style and brain wave patterning. Based solely on Wechsler subtest scores, Gittinger could determine an individual’s personality type plus the environmental factors that sha ped them, accurately predict their reactions to social situations and stressors, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and match them to job tasks or roles. He could also reverse this process and predict Wechsler test scores from observed behaviour - something previously unheard of. By all reports, no one could replicate Gittinger’s understanding of the PAS. I surmise this is mainly due to the secretive nature of the PAS. Gittinger worked for the CIA during the entire time (1950s and 60s) he developed the PAS. Not surprisingly, most information about the PAS remains classified. Gittinger’s original (1964) Atlas , essential for test interpretation, was never published, although a civilian version was published 30 years later. Most of the CIA- funded research conducted on the PAS at MK -ULTRA research epicentres was not published either, as this was fed directly into the CIA database. PAS research hubs included the University of Colorado, Columbia University, Ohio University, and Stanford University. PAS research was subsequently transferred to CIA cut -out organisations: SRI International, Psychological Assessments Associates Inc., and MARS Measurement Associates. Another reason the PAS is unknown is because influential psychologists including Eysenck rejected it as impossible. Most psychologists are too left-brain to comprehend and implement the PAS. They feel threatened by nobodies like Gittinger who create something as brilliant as the PAS without possessing the obligatory PhD. Eysenck felt particularly threatened since he fancied himself an expert on intelligence and personality. Tellingly, his"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":" 312 personality test is not used by the CIA, nor anyone else. I resented rote learning Eysenck’s left -brained crap for exams because it was incomprehensible and incorrect . The person who built the foundation of my knowledge base concerning intelligence theory and psychological testing was Gittinger himself. While studying psychology and gifted education, I was subconsciously guided by what Gittinger explained and demonstrated throughout my childhood. Each time he abused me, every time I was in his presence, he explained exactly what he was doing and why. This was his teaching approach, and it worked. I took to psychometric testing, interpretation, and report writing like I had been studying it for years – because I had. Gittinger stored knowledge of the PAS and other relevant test instruments in my implicit memory system. Indications of this leaked during my psychology studies, notably a 2009 lecture on the MMPI ( Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ). At the start of the class, students were provided preliminary information about an actual, deidentified female client, including her presenting symptomology plus a printout of the raw data from her MMPI test re sults. Our instructor asked us to examine the information and share our initial impressions with the class. I flicked over the pages, rapidly scanned the graphs, raised my hand, and asserted, ‘This client should not work with a male therapist.’ My classmates shot me a perplexed look, while our lecturer swallowed his surprise. Two hours later, our lecturer shared the conclusions that a psychiatric case management team came to after having worked with the client for six months. Their main finding was that the client should not work with a male therapist. When I told my therapist that I was trying to decipher the CIA’s application of the PAS, he exclaimed, ‘ You could write an entire book just on the PAS. You are the PAS! ’ Understanding the PAS requires knowledge of intelligence and brain laterality, which is why I provided a detailed introduction to both concepts. The fundamental premise of the PAS is that intelligence and personality elements are present at birth but can be modified by external factors during development. The PAS recognises the significance of brain laterality, that some people are left-brain dominant, some right brain dominant, some are bilateral processors (meaning both brain hemispheres are highly active during cognitive processing), and some show no particular bias. PAS interpretations were based on Wechsler subtest scaled scores, plus age and sex. Interpretations were derived from Gittinger’s Atlas (1964) which contained a description of every possible personality type. These descriptions were derived from many thousands of Weschler profiles submitted by psychologists worldwide. I doubt the CIA publicly divulged the true size and source of the PAS normative sample. Gittinger identified three core personality dimensions (Cognitive, Procedural and Social). The resultant Primitive personality structure may change in the years preceding adolescence when it becomes fixed. Change stems from pressure during childhood from parents, siblings, teachers, or peers to acquire abilities absent from the original personality structure. This process is called Compensation , the most important dynamic in the PAS. Compensation results in a stable Basic personality level. Further change may occur after adolescence via Modification, which results in a third, Surface level of personality. Surface level personality changes are unstable and can break down under stress. Modification and the Surface personality are what we see when interacting with a person. Compensation and"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":" 313 the Basic personality are what we learn about someone during closer association, and what they feel inside themselves. MK-ULTRA victim files contain pages of PAS notation. This coding system starts as a nine-symbol shorthand to denote the strength of the three original (Primitive) tendencies (Cognitive, Emotional and Social), and the degree and direction of the resultant two adjustment levels (Compensation and Modification). Capit al letters indicate the initial letter in the name of the three core (Primitive) tendencies. Thus, the letter E stands for Externalizer, I for Internalizer. Compensation, or the lack of it, is shown by a lower-case letter placed after the Primitive tendenc y capital letter. For example, Ic stands for Compensated I. The code becomes far more complicated than what has been published, until a victim’s records are full of PAS-based algebraic formula. Core Personality Dimensions The first core personality dimension (Cognitive) can be loosely compared to the idea of introvert versus extrovert. It can also be defined by what the child finds intellectually stimulating. The Primitive Cognitive dimension is determined by the Wechsler Digit Span , a genetically determined measure of auditory processing which is marginally influenced by learning. Arithmetic and Information indicate Basic and Surface levels. I v E Internalizers (I) are preoccupied with their own thoughts and ideas. They prefer to think than do. They are insulated and comfortable alone with their own company. They appear passive, aloof and emotionless. They can work efficiently in a distracting environment. They can easily store and retrieve information, which is why they score well on the Digit Span subtest. The I type is characteristically schizoid, and in the extreme autistic. I’s are externally pressured to compensate by being more outgoing. Externalizers (E) score low on Digit Span . E types are focused and dependent on their environment. They respond spontaneously and directly to people, and mainly detect changes in the environment. E’s rely on their senses, are easily distracted, and do not like being alone. In the extreme, E’s are moody and dominated by events. E’s are pressured to compensate by responding less, being more self -sufficient, and more ideationally aware. The second core dimension (Procedural) refers to a person’s learning style, sensitivity to stimuli, and how they solve mechanical or procedural tasks. Block Design determines the Primitive Procedural level. Similarities and Comprehension indicate Basic and Surface personality levels. R v F Rigid (R) people are preoccupied with detail. R’s are disposed toward order and organisation. They learn by rote, in a sequential manner, and don’t need to understand the whole concept. They react to a limited number of specific, well-defined stimuli. Because they see one thing at a time, R types accept the external environment at face value . They can concentrate and are not easily distracted or confused. R’s do not cope with multiple stimuli simultaneously. They are insensitive, logic-tight, and self-centred. In the extreme, R’s are rigid and can’t see the forest for the trees. R’s are pressured to be more sensitive and flexible."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":" 314 Flexible ( F) people need to understand something to learn it. They must understand the reason behind a task before they will even attempt it. The F sees the whole picture and perceives connections between people and the environment. F’s are overly aware of their environment and respond simultaneously to various stimuli. Consequently, they are easily distracted and confused, and find concentration more difficult. They are intuitive, imaginative and sensitive. They tolerate ambiguity, and notice subtleties and nuances. Their confusion and ability to perceive all aspects of a situation makes them unsure of the world. In the extreme, the F is chaotic. F’ s are pressured to concentrate, be less sensitive, and restrict their awareness. A v U The third dimension (Social) is a measure of social intelligence, or a person’s ability to adapt to new social and cultural settings. The Primitive level is determined by the Wechsler Picture Arrangement subtest. Compensation and Modification are determined by Picture Completion and Object Assembly . High Picture Arrangement scores indicate socio-cultural adaptability. Role Adaptive (A) types score highly on the Picture Arrangement subtest. A’s are charismatic, charming, captivating, and attractive. They are socially versatile and confident. They can appear conforming and conventional, even if they are not. Their developmental environment determines whether they use their appeal to enhance, exploit, or avoid relationships. In the extreme, A’s are social chameleons who lack integrity. Conversely, Role Uniform (U) types present as socially awkward, aloof and inept. They tend to be socially ignored, anxious and avoidant. In the extreme, U’s present the same in every social situation, even if this is inappropriate. U’s are pressured or seduced into trying to be more sociable and charming. Primitive Temperaments have eight possible combinations, as this table shows: 433 Primitive Traits Style IRA Self-motivated, organized, procedural, socially effective. Political IRU Self-motivated, self-concerned, organized, socially aloof. Scientific IFA Self-centred, sensitive, socially active. Artistic IFU Self-centred, sensitive, aloof. Contemplative ERA Outgoing, organized, socially skilled. Entrepreneurial ERU Environmentally attuned, organised, procedural, but socially restrained. Technocratic EFA Outgoing, relating, sensitive, and socially involving. Theatrical EFU Outgoing, sensitive, relating, dependent but socially awkward. Defensive The Relevance of Introversion Gittinger targeted gifted female introverts. High IQ individuals tend to be introverts, hence the PAS Internalizer dimension is determined by high scores on Wechsler subtest items. 433 https://www.pasf.org/pasfj/bintro.pdf"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":" 315 A clue to the relevance of introversion is found in an excerpt from The Encyclopedia of Hypnotism : In some research, women were easier to hypnotize than men, but only by a small percentage. In both sexes, the higher the IQ, the greater the hypnotic susceptibility. In one study, bright female introverts were most susceptible. Extroverts forget more over time than introverts, but they are better at retrieving information from deeply buried memory, especially if it’s relatively inaccessible. Introverts are more affected by punishment, extroverts by reward. That data could be interpreted to make introverts preferred candidates for hypno-programming. They have better memory for unconscious instructions, less ability to recover repressed memory, and are more controllable by suggested suffering . More formal evaluations of hypnotizability are derived from Rorschach or TAT tests and from brainwave patterns ( more alpha indicates more susceptibility ). If the subject had an imaginary playmate in childhood, that also indicates susceptibility. 434 From I to E Knowing my performance on the WAIS 10 years ago, I can see I was born an IFA. My mother clearly recalls my being an Internalizer until Nanna Holowczak took me to Canberra for a week when I was 3 years old. I left home an introvert and returned to my mother as an extrovert. Mengele split my core personality during that Canberra trip. I vaguely recall a discussion I had with Gittinger at age 14, in which he said being born an introvert did not matter because he could easily change an introvert into an extrove rt. I surmise my programmers forced a permanent change to my core personality in Canberra when I was aged 3. I wondered why I was changed from an I to an E. Perhaps it had something to do with the CIA’s research findings that 100 percent of schizophrenics are Internalisers (with 80 percent being R’s, and 75 percent U’s) and they wanted to eliminate any predisposition to my breaking in that direction? Or perhaps they wanted to turn me from a secret-keeper into a talker? Or maybe they wanted me dependent on others instead of being so independent? Or else they wanted to distract me from reflecting inwards and discovering and fixing my dissociation? Then I read an article by one of Gittinger’s CIA assistants which addressed the issue : Compensation not only results in a conditioned change in the individual's behaviour; it builds in emotional qualities that shape the individual's motives, motivations, anxieties, loyalties, goals and guilt... If he is allowed to mature without the pressures and stresses of compensation, he acquires a basic personality that is psychologically very comfortable for him, and very consistent with his primitive style; but he will also be very bland, under motivated, and a sociologically immature person. His temperament and his sensitivities will be self-centred, and he will show little evidence of ambition or responsibility. In those areas where compensation takes place, the individual will show considerable drive, motivation and energy. Thus, the compensated 434 Carla Emery (1998) .

A talented statistician, Saunders created a mathematical Reference Group Model to supplement the PAS. He also helped develop PAS code into algebraic formula to make programming predictions and decisions. David Saunders’ Reference Group Model stemmed from a systematic examination of Wechsler data from many thousands of individuals. His model classified and categorised people into three dimensions (Primitive, Affiliations, and Stress) based on shared psychometric and behavioural characteristics. Gittinger’s PAS combined with Saunders’ Reference Group Model resulted in a tool that profiled every possible personality type, addressed every conceivable human behaviour, and accurately predicted reactions to any given situation. The CIA used the PAS to profile mind control victims, identify weak points, and predict responses to the stress of the MK -ULTRA process. Perpetrators used PAS results to tailor CIA torture methods to the victim’s personality type and psychological capacity. They used the Reference Groups to select an Alter’s brain location, neural circuitry, personality, abilities, and role. This entire process was done in conjunction with EEG readings of the victim’s brain, based on early PAS research on the relationship between PAS results and brainwave activity, particularly alpha activity (which also indicates IQ level). The Reference Model’s Information Processing Style dimension includes four types of brain-hemispheric development: Left-Brained, Right-Brained, Bilateral, or Externally Controlled. Left and Bilateral processors are skilled at logical reasoning. Ri ght-Brain and Bilateral processors are skilled at pattern recognition. Externally controlled types are not particularly skilled at either. Right-brained groups are predominantly female, while Left- brained are mainly male . The reference Model’s Stress Response Style encompasses three approaches to coping with multiple stimuli: Poly-Actives thrive on simultaneously accomplishing multiple tasks; Pro-Actives can only cope with finishing one task at a time; while Re-Actives must be instructed and guided to cope with any task. Although there have been revisions, I include the 1984 version of the PAS Reference Groups below because this is the closest to my age as a victim. The 96 groups are arranged in the following table which highlights the most important relationships among the groups. 435 Marshall N. Heyman (1982).

The model identifies the correct hemispheric location of each artificiall y created Alter’s independent neural circuitry. It also clusters multiple roles relevant to one position within the cult hierarchy; for example, during her position as Grande Dame , Patricia Ann Conlon performed every role listed in Group 5 below: Role Application Teacher Instructed children in all aspects of cult life Programmer Principal MK -ULTRA handler and programmer Acolyte Assisted in Luciferian ritual ceremonial duties Philosopher Highly academic and intellectual Conservator Oversaw and protected cult trainees from injury Iconoclast Attacked established beliefs and institutions as a Marxist Communist ALP pioneer feminist Physician Cult he rbalist, ritual surgeon , and counsellor Mediator Liaised between members of the cult hierarchy, CIA staff, and victims The eight possible Primitive temperament combinations, and 12 ways for each combination to develop, results in 96 Reference Groups. Each Reference Group represents a combination of one of three Stress Response styles, with one of four patterns of Information Processing. This 3 x 4 x 8 factor arrangement allows for 4,096 personality combinations. Add to this the effect of the other PAS factors I have not mentioned here, and we can begin to fathom how the PAS comprehensively accounts for individual personality differences. Over 1.7 million different personality combinations may be calculated using the PAS. This figure supports my hypothesis that (a) the PAS is a prescription for multiple personality programming, and (b) the PAS accounts for the massive split-personality systems that ‘poly- fragmented’ victims and therapists have reported for decades. CIA Case Officer Profile MK-ULTRA psychologist Henry Murray said: ‘Spying is attractive to loonies. Psychopaths, who are people who spend their lives making up stories, revel in the field.’ Several retired CIA employees wr ote their memoires. Some detailed the psychometric testing they underwent during the recruitment process. Their testimonies reveal much about the application of the PAS, and the truth of CIA bla ck operations. Former CIA case officer Ralph McGehee 436 describes Gittinger’s PAS as the ‘most revealing test’ he undertook. He described the ideal CIA case officer as the Externalized-Rigid- Adaptive (ERA) personality. ERA types possess the following characteristics: - Magnetic, charming and captivating - Make good first impressions - Move easily in a variety of situations - Appropriately express genuine or fake feelings 436 Ralph W. McGehee (1983). Deadly Deceits: My 25 Years in the CIA . Ocean Press."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":" 319 - Chameleon like (All things to all people) - Can spot weaknesses in others and use these to their advantage - React to a limited number of specific, well-defined stimuli - Learn by rote - Don’t insist on perspective - Psychologically insulated - Have restricted awareness - Self-centred and insensitive to others. McGehee said the CIA rejected Case Officer candidates who ha ve perspective, see subtleties, think before they act, and remain true to themselves despite outside social pressures. McGehee himself scored highly (143) on the IQ testing component but noted this did not pose a problem. He said his application for the role of CIA case officer was almost rejected because the PAS identified him as Flexible. McGehee said his saving grace was his college football experience. The CIA recruited football players for paramilitary operations because they were ‘not overly intellectual’ They also recruited men with military backgrounds, or those who possessed some special talent. In summary, the CIA prefer case officers to be externally controlled, left -brain sequential thinkers who: subvert their individuality for the team’s benefit, blindly follow orders, can’t join the dots to see the CIA’s criminal objectives, won’t question the CIA’s motives, and don’t care anyhow about the people the CIA use and abuse during their covert operations. The CIA exclude bright, lateral thinking, bilateral processors who might perceive the CIA are committing heinous crimes, and who possess the empathy and moral fortitude to object. Former CIA operations officer Rueul Gerecht described case officers as ‘bottom- feeders ’ who handle intelligence -collection and covert-action operations. 437 Such operations include the trafficking of drugs, arms and children, money laundering, and the financing of terrorist activities. Case officers recruit and handle CIA agents using dirty methods like sexual blackmail, honey traps, and threats. Picture the CIA case officer as the pimp, and the agent as the reluctant prostitute. According to Gerecht, case officers ‘search the strengths and weaknesses of character in the foreigners they want to recruit and run as agents; few things are off limits.’ 438 The PAS is used to profile potential agents and to identify the ir k ey strengths and weaknesses for the CIA case officers to exploit . Thanks to Gittinger’s training, CIA scouts determine a target’s basic personality type just from observing whether they become withdrawn or garrulous when intoxicated with drugs or alcohol. This is precisely the type of behaviour case officers would observe in targets at recruitment parties such as occurred at pedophile Hugh Heffner’s Playboy mansion. Hugh Heffner, Jeffery Epstein, Jordan Belfort (‘Wolf of Wall Street’ ) are prime examples of CIA agents. Jimmy Savile was their UK equivalent. These men were ideally 437 Reuel Marc Gerecht (2013).

Most people of influence are controlled with money, drugs, sex scandals, and pedophilia. The CIA also used prostitution and homosexuality as blackmail and honeypot tools back when they constituted criminal offences and were considered socially scandalous. At Heffner’s Playboy Mansion, straight blackmail targets were lured with a promise of associating with scantily clad beautiful women and celebrities. Innocent targets were drugged and photographed with clearly underaged and / or male sex partners, and the staged photos were enough to create the leverage of control the CIA sought over the now -compromised targets. Former CIA officer John Kiriakou spoke at the No War 2017: War and the Environment conference held in Washington, DC on 22 September 2017. During this, Kiriakou confirmed the type of case officer the CIA recruits, and why: There is no ethics training at the CIA. Nothing. The problem with that (besides the obvious) is what a CIA psychiatrist once told me; he said the CIA actively seeks to hire people who have sociopathic tendencies . Not sociopaths, but people with sociopathic tendencies. Sociopaths have no conscience; and with no conscience you can easily pass a polygraph exam because you don’t react to anything. But sociopaths are impossible to control. People who have sociopathic tendencies do have a conscience, but they’re willing to operate in moral, legal, and ethical grey areas. The problem is, there’s no real way to weed out the sociopaths. And if you can’t weed out the sociopaths, you can’t weed out the psychopaths. And the psychopaths, because they’re psychopaths, rise to the leadership positions . So, let’s say that you are a CIA case officer and you’re working overseas. And it can be anywhere. Let’s say the Middle East. You’re in Egypt. You’re in a hotel room and you have recruited a member of a bonafide terrorist group, Al -Quaeda, Hezbollah, ISIS, whatever it is. And this guy has been fantastic. Everything that he’s told you has been true. And you’ve used his information to actually disrupt future terrorist attacks. So, he’s been vetted and he’s really great. So, you’re in this hotel room and you’r e meeting with him. And at the start of the meeting he says, ‘Listen, before we meet, I wanna tell you, I’ve given you everything, I’ve told you everything that’s been true, you’ve saved American lives, now you’re gonna do something for me. You’re gonna go out and you’re gonna get me a prostitute right now or I’m never cooperating with you again...’ The answer is, ‘Sure.’ I mean, you know, he’s a scumbag of course, but your job is to deal with scumbags, and you would be expected to go out and get him the prostitute . What if he asks for a child prostitute ? Absolutely not, under any circumstances. But that’s not the CIA talking. That’s John Kiriakou talking. Because there’s no rule. Your job as a CIA case officer is to break the laws of the country you’re serving; that’s your job. Your job is to commit espionage, which in most countries is a death penalty crime. Your job is to convince people to commit treason for you, because they like you so much, or they like the money that you’re giving them so much. So, because it’s the nature of your job to break the law, there are no rules that are written for you to carry out that job. Now the problem there is that most CIA case officers would procure the child prostitute . And even if they felt funny about it, they would be told by headquarters, ‘You have a job to do. This is a bonafide source here. Go do your"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":" 321 job.’ That’s the problem, or the nature of the problem, of ethics in intelligence operations : there are no ethics in intelligence operations ... You either enter the CIA with your own set of moral values, or you don’t. And if you don’t, you’re probably going to do very well there.’ The IQ End Game I no longer feel guilty confessing my IQ score, especially since subsequent events have validated this memory to my satisfaction. As part of my six years of psychology training, I was required to practise IQ assessment with colleagues. I played guinea pig for a student peer in 2007, prior to my vestibular stroke. I blitzed the entire Wechsler test battery, especially Block Design which I threw down as quick as humanly possible. I even blitzed the math problems when I suffer math phobia (yep, it’s a real thing). I remember feeling so relaxed and unthreatened during testing, I calculated the math and blurted out the answers the moment my friend finished asking the questions. My therapist assessed me in early 2014. I underwent a battery of tests, the results of which indicated high IQ (despite my stroke damage). I also completed working memory training and my final learning index for this was more than double the average. My therapist provided an interviewer the following answers to questions regarding my intelligence level: Q. In addition to her cognitive assessment presented via the QEEG tests, what is your opinion as to Fiona's level of intelligence? A. Fiona possesses a robust cognitive profile that is highly adaptive. Her cognition was assessed utilising the IntegNeuro and elevated scores were seen across the spectrum. To further support this she has a fast Alpha peak of 11hz as noted in her QEEG indicating high intelligence. Q. Would you describe Fiona Barnett as being gifted in any way? A. F iona is certainly gifted in many ways. She is a brilliant writer, researcher and thinker. He memory recall is astounding and her ability to put facts and incidents together to solve or re solve is phenomenal. She is artistic and apparently musical. She could be a brilliant teacher and a brilliant lawyer. I just hope she is arguing my case if that is ever necessary. Q. What do you understand about people who are gifted in some way? A. Gifted people can present in many different ways. They are often highly sensitive, easily bored by the mundane aspects of life, and often brutally honest to the point of being socially questionable. They have an intensity in energy, imagination, intellect, sen sitivity and emotion. They are a particularly vulnerable group, often rejected by peers due to their different tastes in life, interests etc. Different IQ levels also present with different needs, interests and sensitivities. The greatest dose of IQ validation was injected when I had my own two children assessed for giftedness on the Stanford Binet 5. My kids were tested at age 8 years following problems with boredom and underachievement at school. My eldest scored in the >99.9 9 th "},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":" 322 percentile, reaching the ceiling on certain subtests including visual -spatial processing. My youngest child scored one IQ point higher than her sister. Sydney’s giftedness guru explained to me that my eldest daughter had the intellectual capacity of a 35-year-old. ‘She could be one in a million... but I’d need to assess her on the LM to know.’ The educational psychologist then advised me to pull my child out of her so-called giftedness program, concluding, ‘ No school in the country can cater for this.’ Upon received my eldest child’s comprehensive psychological report, I exclaimed to the assessor, ‘Did you assess my child – or me ?! What you wrote perfectly describes me.’ Then, after receiving the youngest’s report, I felt compelled to ask, ‘I don’t under stand these newer tests and what their scores mean. I relate better to the old tests. How does the SB5 compare to the L-M?’ ‘You can’t really compare them. It’s harder to achieve a high score on the new test. You only had to score highly in one area on th e old test to boost your IQ score. You have to do well on every subtest to score highly now.’ ‘So, can you give me a rough idea. Based on their SB5 scores and your experience at having tested kids on both tests, what do you expect my kids to score on the old L-M?’ ‘In the one -seventies to one -eighties.’ ‘I recall being tested on the SB L-M at age five. Obviously, I can’t access my original report, but I recall scoring one eighty overall, two hundred on visual -spatial processing. Is that score feasible ?’ ‘Absolutely! There’s three of you, all the same.’ The psychologist who tested my kids is the only Australian I trust to obtain an accurate assessment of a gifted child; the only professional I found who demonstrated an appreciation of the implications of being bright. Most mental health professionals and educators, including those who claim expertise in giftedness, are in fact useless. They are clueless to the basics of giftedness and visual-spatial processing, never mind nuances like Linda Silverman’s d iscovery of an obscure spike on the bell curve at the IQ 160 mark, or that IQ 160+ kids are susceptible to a unique type of reactive hypoglycaemia , or that such kids are prone to a type of existentialist depression . Consequently, giftedness characteristics are commonly misdiagnosed as indicators of autism, Aspergers, mania, depression, OCD, ADHD and BPD. Abnormality in the form of genius is routinely overlooked and mislabelled insanity. If mental health professionals do not understand the basics of giftedness and visual- spatial learning, and if they label gifted people nuts just for being gifted, how can they begin to provide adequate services to high IQ victims of MK -ULTRA mind control? While Australian educators ignore the intellectually gifted student – others are watching . School children are quietly tracked via performance on national competitions, online math and science programs, and participation in gifted education holiday camps. Australian Junior high school students identified as intellectually gifted are encouraged to participate in The JASON Project , an online science curriculum program purportedly designed to motivate and inspire students to pursue a science career. It was developed by NASA, NOAA, and the National Geographic Society, among others. Universities are hunting grounds for recruitment into Australia’s secret services. Students who perform outstandingly at public universities are nominated by lecturers for life membership in an international academic society called Golden Key . At the end of their"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":" 323 university degree, Golden Key graduates with an unblemished background and who participated in Golden Key training sessions hosted at Sydney’s head Freemason Lodge receive email invitations from ASIO, A ustralian Federal Police, and ASIS to jump the rigorous application process to the interview stage for potential employment. And when the gifted science students graduate, they can join the real JASON Group of elite scientists who continue the Nazi legacy in deep underground military facilities, working on top secret projects that I discuss in the following chapter. Projects involving anti-gravity, stargates, plasma weapons, hadron colliders, and transhumanism - the forbidden mixing of human, animal and alien materials to develop the ultimate vaccination, with the goal of genetically altering human DNA. The resultant vaccine promises to make soldiers immune to sleep, hunger and injury , to enhance our physical, intellectual and spiritual capacities, and disengage the death gene. The recipients will then become all that Hollywood has been promising its viewers – immortal, superior men . . . supermen. Perhaps then, the communist egalitarianism that the Luciferian system has been pushing for will finally be achieved. This may be the fundamental reason why naturally gifted, bilateral processor s are quashed like second class citizens, and why our situation w ill not improve. If the Bible is to be taken seriously, God built into mankind a group of natural born leaders. The Biblical description of King David is a fine example of this select -group. David demonstrated classic giftedness characteristics including intensity, spiritual awareness, extreme social justice, loyalty, empathy, passion, moral reasoning, higher-order thinking, musical brilliance, and a talent for architecture and engineering. He passed his physical and psychological characteristics to his son Solomon, the most intelligent human who will ever be. If today’s gifted individuals were acknowledged, accommodated, and permitted to assume their natural leadership roles, instead of the left-brained psychopaths who educate and govern us, our society might better reflect the prosperity of Solomon’s age instead of the evil, crime -ridden, decaying cesspit that it is. Out of jealousy and a desire to be just like God, the enemy sought to destroy God’s creation and replace it with an imitation. In this process, God’s tall poppies were cut down - and idiocy took the throne. Failing to find his own dirt, the enemy manipulated, threatened, and deceived our bright minds into rearranging God’s creation, his ultimate goal being the production of an imitation of God’s elite which the devil calls his own. * * * "},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":" 324 The Programming Matrix MK was a CIA gig, not DoD. - Lt.

I was living the scene from the Matrix movie where Neo stood in a white corridor in front of a row of doors, each door leading to a different scene of the matrix virtual reality program. Except, this room was black and confined. It was shaped like a pentagon. I was surrounded by five locked doors. I opened each door, stood back, and spoke: ‘It’s safe to come out now.’ A sea of blue-eyed blonde faces slowly emerged from the doorways, ranging in age from three to sixteen years. Some were clothed in frilled baby-doll dresses, ritual robes, martial arts gi, jodhpurs, or painting smocks. Some were naked, bloody, bleeding and bruised. They all appeared bewildered and frightened. Light emanating from the five doorways flooded the room which was now packed with a crowd. Suddenly every single person in that room realised what had happened, looked up at Heaven - and screamed in unity: ‘GIVE ME JUSTICE !!’ I buried my head into the back of the couch, raised my hand to heaven – and screamed from some unfathomable place. I screamed until my consciousness left my body and I was oscillating between two dimensions. In the other dimension, I stood in the middle of a long,"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":" 325 rectangular -shaped room that resembled an ornate palace ballroom. Tall elders dressed in stately robes and gold crowns were seated along the two lengths of the celestial hall. The elders stared at the floor in solemn, reverent, pensive silence as I pleaded my case against Antony Kidman. My cries in this world translated into language in that place which the elders understood. I saw the elders deliberate over Antony Kidman’s judgement. I marvelled at the reverence they had for a single human life, even that of a most vile evil human being. I saw them reluctantly pass judgement over Kidman and condemn him to Death and Hell. I lay on a couch throughout this integration process, with my husband seated next to me. My husband thought he should support me by holding my outstretched hand – something I resented because every time he touched me , I was sucked back into this world. Each time Jon released my hand I could see the celestial hall. Afterwards, I explained everything I saw. Both my therapist and husband thought I was simply emotional and imagining things. I further detailed the experience to my therapist in an email that night. To everyone’s astonishment, the following day the Australian media reported that Antony Kidman was dead. He had died under questionable circumstances in Singapore immediately after I witnessed his celestial judgement. * * * DID Defined What is commonly called a ‘multiple personality’ or an ‘alter’ is no more than a brain area sectioned off by trauma-induced amnesia walls. A group of behaviours and memories are separated from the victim’s general brain functioning, so that different ‘personalities’ within an individual possess independent neural circuitry. All mind control programming is a variation on a theme, determined in part by the victim’s own imagination and their predicted roles within both the CIA and the Luciferian Cult. Hence, while Alice and Oz are universally employed programming scripts, their application differs for each child victim. Think of this process as a computer game in which the player can partly determine its design. For this reason, the recovering victim can subvert the program, just like Neo did in The Matrix , since everything is occurring within the recovering victim’s mind in the absence of the original programmer. This recovery process is easier when the original programmers are dead, and the bond with them severed. The more creative and visual the child victim, the more highly skilled the programmer, the more sophisticated the technology used – the more seamless the result. Since my programming was perpetrated by the fathers of modern mind control at prime CIA and military intelligence facilities, and because I possessed maximum creative and visual -spatial capacity, my shifting between alters was relatively undetectable. These factors may also account for why I have always been co-conscious during memory retrieval. Most victims of mind control are seriously dissociative during therapy work, or even daily existence, they have little to no recall for what just occurred during a therapy session. Not only have I always been completely aware of what is occurring during therapy - I have consistently planned and directed my own recovery process. I also believe my programmers intentionally designed me to be co-conscious for recall, since dissociative recall by individual alters would have facilitated instant download of information – and my brain stored too many military secrets for that. Co-conscious recall is difficult because the victim battles her own will to remember."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":" 326 Memories for trauma are clearer than memories for everyday events. Flashback memories of trauma are extremely lucid and detailed, like a movie. Further, high IQ young children develop asynchronously compared to normal kids, and have superior, often photographic memories. My earliest memory is of being a toddler and waking up crying. To distract me, my father took me onto the balcony, pointed up at the dark sky and said, ‘Look! Look at the stars!’ That is a clear memory. So, yes, it is highly plausible for me to recall memories of being tortured and abused at age three years. My programming was laid at multiple Australian and US facilities during the early 1970s to mid-1980s, including the following : - University of Sydney - Chelmsford Hospital, Sydney - US Embassy, Canberra - Fairbain Airforce base, Canberra - Holsworthy Army Base - ANSTO Nuclear Reactor, Lucas Heights - Milson Island, Hawkesbury River - Disneyland, California - Dulce, New Mexico A team of USA and Australian programmers, handlers, and military trainers were employed, with large teams of assistants at their disposal who worked around the clock during intense programming times: - Joseph Mengele - Louis Jolyon West - Michael Aquino - John Gittinger - Antony Kidman - Leonas Petrauskas - Patricia Ann Conlon - Victor Chang Programming Scripts These people used ancient programming scripts passed down through Luciferian dynasties. Scripts employed traditional nursery rhymes and fairy tales, modern cartoons based on ancient mythologies, and children’s books series specifically written for programming purposes. Programming scripts included: The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe , Peter Pan , Lord of the Rings , Alice in Wonderland, and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . Note the word ‘wonder’ in the last two titles. Oz is Osiris, and mind control was developed in Ancient Egypt. The authors of children’s classics were linked to pedophilia scandals and/or occultic societies that practise pedophilia as a religious rite. Reformed Luciferian John Todd Collins outed close friends J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis as HOGD members. J.R.R Tolki en’s son ‘Father"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":" 327 John Tolkien’ was outed in the UK press as a pedophile Catholic priest with a penchant for altar boys. C.S. Lewis’ Narnia series features a character named Tumnus who is based on the pedophile god Pan. James M. Barrie’s Peter Pan similarly paid homage to Pan. Barrie’s concept of Lost Boys refers to boys’ whose emotional development was stunted at the age at which they were first child raped and inherited the pedophile spirit of Pan. Alice in Wonderland series author Lewis Carroll was a pedophile who took naked photos of his obsession, a young child named Alice. Peter Pan author J.M. Barrie groomed the parents of three Davies boys and forged their will to gain custody of the ir sons after they were orphaned. Michael Davies suicided with his male lover at 21. Barrie had written him at age eight years, ‘Dear Michael, I am very fond of you, but don’t tell anyone.’ Peter Davies burnt all of Barrie’s letter s, and said, ‘It was all too much’ before he also suicided. C.S. Lewis similarly to ok custody of young orphaned boys after marrying their dying mother. Underground pedophile networks were named Peter Pan Club and Lewis Carroll Collectors Guild because their founders recognised James M. Barrie ( Peter Pan ) and Lewis Carroll ( Alice in Wonde rland ) as pedophiles. The Narnia series charmed the Protestant churches during the 1980s. My protests of ‘It’s satanic’ were met with ‘ Aslan represented Christ and the characters and story reflected the Bible.’ The Holy Ghost does not inspire Christians to glorify Baphomet in fairy tales aimed at kids. My youth group leader (our pastor’s daughter) justified screen ing occult -themed movie s by arguing ‘It’s okay so long as good triumphed over evil at the end of the tale.’ Dumb sheep similarly justify the Harry Potter books because ‘at least it encourages kids to read.’ The Harry Potter series contain the same Witchcraft 101 content taught to coven children . These books and films are programming and witchcraft teaching tools. Ancient Egyptian and Babylonian programming scripts starring pagan gods were represented within Western culture as popular cartoon characters, for the expressed purpose of programming a new generation of child victims. Pagan gods Dagon and Diana were rebranded Aqua Man and Wonder Woman . These comic characters originally engaged in Luciferian themes of torture, kidnapping, sexual violence and sadism. The people who developed these characters were connected to MK -ULTRA. For instance, the Isis-worshipping character Wonder Woman was created by William Marston, MK-ULTRA psychologist and lie detector inventor . Marston hired Lauretta Bender as a consultant to develop the Wonder Woman comic. Lauretta Bender was a MK -ULTRA paediatric neuropsychiatrist who routinely electrocuted children, including toddlers, at Bellevue Hospital in New York. Marston described Wonder Woman as ‘...psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who, I believe, should rule the world.’ Thus, Wonder Woman captures the Jezebel spirit of de - masculinisation of society, as promoted by the Luciferian Order. Other cartoon characters incorporated in my programming were: Casper, Batman, Cat Woman, Top Cat, and Felix The Cat. I recall a Cat Woman programming sequence that was chanted at me in the Holsworthy lab. The program had nine levels based on a cat’s nine lives. When Kidman reached level six, he shoved his face in mine, and stared into my left eye (which directly accessed my right brain hemisphere) and chanted: ‘Number six! Number six! What do we find at number six? Number six has lots of tricks ! There are six spirits at number six.’ Disneyland, Disneyworld and Walt Disney films were specifically developed for programming MK-ULTRA child victims like me. Famous pioneer psychologists and psychiatrists hired out Disneyland of a night to practice programming children. I was"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":" 328 subjected to Candy Land and Disney Princess programming that focussed on the Evil Queen and Wicked stepmother characters. Disney movies used to create and reinforce my programming included: Fantasia , Peter Pan (with a focus on Tinkerbell) , Sleeping Beauty , Cinderella , Snow White and Bambi. Popular TV shows were also used, especially Bewitched and I Dream of Jeanie. Certain songs were used to reinforce or trigger my MK -ULTRA programming. I would often find myself stuck in a thought loop with one of these, to stop me recalling my abuse. The most memorable songs used on me were: Queen of Hearts , The Candy Man , Wild Thing , Candy Girl , and Funky Town. The MK -ULTRA scientists abused me within a Luciferian ritual context. Scientists in white lab coats played a synthesiser chanting the names of these interdimensional entities, to insert them into and cement my programming. In a research lab beneath Holsworthy Army Base, technicians programmed the words, ‘Know this spirit, know this spirit, know this spirit... ’ into a synthesiser and repeatedly played this up and down the keyboard at various speeds, while Kidman and others breathed ‘spirits’ into my mouth. Programming Structure The Induction The hypnosis induction script that accessed my programming began with me diving into the sea and swimming like Aqua Man to an underwater structure with a glass dome on top. I entered the glass dome which closed after me; the water drained. I passed through a set of sealed doors and reached the top of a metal spiral staircase. While descending the"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":" 329 clockwise staircase, I spun in an anti-clockwise direction. Then I passed through another sealed door, descended a straight staircase, and entered a final sealed door. Behind the final door lay a 1960s doctor surgery waiting room. The long thin room featured brown panel walls and doors. As I entered the room, an elevator stood to my left. To the right of that a secretary sat typing at a desk which featured an old dial phone. To the right of the desk was a surgery door labelled Dr Kidman . Continuing right, the next door had a White Rabbit image instead of a name; it represented Joseph Mengele whose name was forbidden. The third door, at the opposite far end of the hall, was labelled Dr West . Two doors on the right wall were labelled Dr Gittinger and Dr Aquino . Young Joseph Mengele . Joseph Mengele ? My memory of 61- year -old Joseph Mengele. Lt. Col. Michael Aquino – Joseph Mengele’s secret son?"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":" 330 Joseph Mengele in Australia In 1991 , I drew a close-up of Kim Beazley Snr accurate enough for my mother to instantly recognise him. My art therapy was drawn directly from implicit memory. When I drew a scene or person, sometimes it was like the individual was posing for a portrait. Sometimes I knew what I was drawing, other times the image unfolded before my eyes as if I were observing someone else moving the pencil. Mengele was about 61 years old and fat like a toad when I met him at the US Embassy in Canberra. During therapy I had a flashback to his face which I drew. His serpent eyes were framed by full brows and dark circles beneath. His dark hair was slicked back. A photo of an obese man seated at a table, said to be Joseph Mengele, appeared on the internet. This photo better resemble s my memory of Mengele than the person the CIA confirmed lived and died in South America. I believe that was a lookalike, promoted by the CIA as part of a Psychological Operation to distract the public from the international role Mengele played in Project MK -ULTRA, and to discredit witness testimonies like mine . Helen Holowczak took me to Canberra for a week when I was three years old. A week provides ample time to lay base MK -ULTRA programming . During this trip, Helen took photos of me dressed like Alice In Wonderland in a pale blue frock, red shoes and white cardigan, indicating mild weather. My mother said I returned home from that Canberra excursion with a completely different core personality. I uncharacteristically ordered my mother out of my bedroom and told her I could clean it up myself. I further shocked her by dressing up and performing a promiscuous dance. Joseph Mengele laid my Core programming during that Canberra trip, in a lab beneath the US Embassy. The embassy was staffed with CIA pedophiles and hosted VIP pedophile orgies, like nearby Parliament House. A tunnel system existed beneath the US Embassy in which some of my abuse occurred. I was left naked and alone in a cage built into the side of a dark underground cave. I lost track of time but might have been left there for three days. During that time, Jesus appeared to me and taught me the first verse of the children’s song Jesus Loves Me . Thirty years ago, I regressed under severe trauma and sang this to my mother exactly like a three -year-old would. I was subsequently tortured in a lab by Mengele and his assistants. At the start of this process, Mengele promised I could attend a fete being held on the US Embassy grounds for the diplomats’ children and their special guests. Mengele used the fete as a conditioning tool. Since I was special now, I too was invited – so long as I cooperated. The fete featured red- and-white striped tents decorated with candy canes and lollipops, a fairy-floss maker, miniature pony rides, and a petting zoo. But I didn’t enjoy any of it. I felt sick. I felt confused. I felt frightened. I felt as though there was something very wrong inside my head. They broke my head! I lamented. They broke my head! All I cared for was my mother. ‘Mengele is the White rabbit!’ The epiphany struck me during therapy. Mengele and his team wore white lab coats. One assistant was a red-headed female medical doctor. Another was Antony Kidman. I hear d the tune Puppe t on a String as Mengele and his assistants circled me. They shoved me from side to side. They spun me around and around until I was dizzy...

One day I'm feeling down on the ground, then I'm up in the air... Mengele electrocuted my left arm until it went limp. He picked it up and dropped it onto the table, and asked, ‘Look, yo ur arm is broken. Do you want your arm back? ’ I nodded and cried. I could have it back only if I did as he said. And if I were good, I would get a pony ride. He tied a string to my arm and manipulated it like a marionette. In or out, there is never a doubt, just who's pulling the strings... They strapped me to an examination bed and electrocuted me. They placed a giant electrode on my back plus zapped me all over with multiple cattle prods, even inside my vagina. My back arched violently as I screamed for m y mother. They did this until I went quiet and still. Fritz Springmeier and his wife Cisco Wheeler wrote that the initial MK -ULTRA splits were created in a sensory deprivation chamber using LSD, and that the brain naturally dissociates into five components. That is consistent with my experience. John C. Lilly designed the original MK-ULTRA sensory deprivation chamber. Using the chamber in combination with LSD, Lilly conducted research into penetrating the veil separating our dimension from others. His research was the premise for the 1980 film Altered States . Lilly achieve d his goal. My base MK -ULTRA programming was laid inter-dimensionally using a sensory deprivation tank , LSD, and musical tones. Once I was limp from electrocution, Mengele and his team led me to a room containing a black sensory deprivation tank filled wi th salty water. They fed me a sweet drink, put something on my head, and lay me inside the floatation tank. Either the electrocution or drugs, or both, prevented me from thrashing about. Voices and music were played on an audio system as I drifted into an LSD trip. Suddenly, I fell through the floor and landed on a hard surface. I was in a black room surrounded by doors. A familiar voice told me I must leave a part of me behind if I wanted to escape the dark. I did as he instructed. This part became the Ga tekeeper. The Gatekeeper was eventually split into five personalities. I have a vague memory of watching each enter one of the five doors and the door closing behind them. At some stage the doors were assigned what became the standard colours: green, blue, red, white, yellow. These colours were associated with types of alters, tasks or programming as follows: - Green : Intellect - Blue : Soldier - Red: Ritual - White: Hypnosis - Yellow: Drugs The green door housed splits that were intellectual, academic, artistic, or musical. The blue door contained soldier, Delta, assassin, psychic training including projects gateway and stargate, and military, horse riding, and martial arts costumes. The red door contained countless ritual abuse experiences and occult training. The white door housed hypnosis- induced roles and tasks, including Candy Girl. The yellow door contained drug programmes, knowledge , and drug-influenced assignments."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":" 332 A dummy room was installed between this pentagon room and the doctors waiting room, to disguise and protect the Core programming. Consequently, entering the door marked ‘Dr Kidman’ led me to a dark pentagon room with the standard five coloured doors; however, each of the five doors housed a trap. For instance, the red door contained an inescapable maze. A series of knocks on each door opened access to the real pentagon room below. One knock on the green door, followed by two knocks on the blue, followed by three knocks on the red, four on the white, and five on the yellow, opened a chute in the floor which dropped into Mengele’s Core program. The Core is the victim’s soul or consciousness, the part that leaves our body when we die or astral project. It was my Core that moved effortlessly into the celestial dimension. According to Fritz Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler, the Luciferian Order conducted research into what might occur were the victim’s Core exposed to the dissociated parts. The result was"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":" 333 instant integration. That is precisely what happened to me the moment I consciously saw the Core programming structure and met the alters hidden behind the five pentagon doors. I believe the doctor waiting room was a disguise to hide the location of the Core split, because recalling Mengele’s initial split was the point at which I achieved major spontaneous integration. I did not recall the doctor waiting room until years after my Core integration. Mengele on Milson Island Australia’s ‘Lunatic Asylum’ Horrors: ‘It was one Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in Reality’ Megan Palin, news.com.au , 6 Dec 2015 . IF the walls of the abandoned ‘lunatic asylum’ on Peat Island could speak they would tell of the horrors experienced by patients, including children, on a site plagued by death and despair. The eight -hectare island on the Hawkesbury River was established as an asylum for ‘inebriates’ in 1911 before it was reopened as a psychiatric hospital , just 50kms north of Sydney... Both media and government departments reported torture, multiple drownings and unexplained deaths of men and little boys. According to reports, ‘Ward 4’, was where the most brutal treatment took place. The mysterious deaths of child patients repeatedly made headlines over the years of the facility’s operation. Among them was the case of Robert Bruce Walker, 8, who was found floating off the island after he had been ‘put in the pen’, a caged compartment, as punishment, in 1940... In May 1950, 11-year -old Robert Blackwood was found asphyxiated in a linen bin made of iron after only five months at the institution... Many other unexplained deaths also took place on the island. At least 300 patients who died at the institution were buried in unmarked graves at the nearby Brooklyn Cemetery. Reports of sexual and physical abuse, torture and a lack of thorough investigations also spilt out from under the closed doors of the site. One of the most shocking incidents made headlines across the country in 1983. ‘A retarded youth’s 10 fingernails were torn out while under temporary care in a psychiatric institution, ’ the Daily Telegraph reported in 1983. ‘In a 39 page report the NSW deputy ombudsman Darryl Gunter, criticised the Health Department for not investigating the matter adequately. Mr Gunter’s report stems from complaints by the youth’s parents. They left their 17 - year -old son at the Peat Island Hospital on the Hawkesbury River on January 10, 1 981. When they collected him on January 28, he was without his fingernails. The parents rejected reports from doctors that a 12 -year -old patient was responsible.’ Peat Island and its close neighbour, Milson Island, served as MK -ULTRA / MK-NAOMI research facilities. Milson Island is larger and accessible by boat only. Both Peat and Milson featured hospitals. The Milson Island hospital was used by the military during WWII, and it contained a system of hidden doors for nurses to hide from violent patients. Milson Island"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":" 334 psychiatric residents were transferred to the Peat Island hospital in the early 1970s, just after MK-ULTRA was exposed in the USA and moved to Australia. Milson Island was a Federal Government facility . That is how the Australian and US military accessed it. Milson Island is Australia’s equivalent of the USA’s Plum Island. It started off as a military quarantine facility and merged into a MK -NAOMI bioweapons research facility. Lyme disease and Swine disease were being researched on Milson Island in 1961 to ’62. When Lyme turned up in 1982, the Americans assumed there had been a leak on Milson Island. Sydney University took over Lyme testing from 1988 to ‘ 94, tested 4,372 people and did not get one positive in that testing – because they used the ELISA test. Everyone tests negative to the ELISA test. It tests the immune system which is not stimulated by Lyme Disease. ELISA is the only test allowed under Medicare. Great secrecy surrounds Milson Island which was recently demolished and developed into a recreational camp for children . Milton Island hospital is the only remaining building, and it looks like the hospital I was taken to where I again encountered Joseph Mengele. Leonas Petrauskas drove me to the Hawkesbury when I was about seven or eight years old. He collected me from Nanna’s Engadine house in a blue sedan. It must have been summer because I wore a yellow gingham strap dress. I stuck my face out the open window and let the wind tangle my white hair. ‘You can call me Leo,’ he said. That was the trigger to engage in casual conversation. Usually I called him by his pseudonym Mark. ‘Do you like monkeys?’ he continued. ‘Yes.’ ‘Would you like to see some monkeys?’ ‘Yes. Are we going to the zoo?’ ‘Sort of,’ Leo promised. He got a sadistic kick out of surprising me with horror. We were visiting ‘monkey island’ where they did gene splicing , crossing monkey with human DNA. It was a real-life Island of Doctor Moreau that left me terrified of the Planet of the Apes films. I next remember sitting on overgrown lawn outside a long hospital building on Milson Island. I pick ed yellow flowers while Anne Conlon warned me, I was about to experience something ‘unpleasant’ and I should go to my ‘happy place.’ I realised Ronnie usually turned up if they were about to kill me – or worse. She would always be there when I awoke from the nightmare, to comfort and counsel me. Anne Conlon walked me inside the hospital where a uniformed nurse sat behind a reception desk. The nurse walked me down the corridor and into a laboratory on the left. The lab contained caged monkeys and an office out the back. It was the lab in my induction scenario, behind the door marked ‘White Rabbit.’ My next memory is of being tied faceup to a medical table and raped by the obese greasy Doctor of Death who stood panting at the end of the bed. ‘Pappa’ Kidman Kidman’s tampering caused my programming to malfunction and eventually break down. Kidman tampered with Mengele’s Core program when I was six years old, to overlay and link his Order of the Easter Star pendant as an induction trigger. This occurred at the Chelmsford MK -ULTRA facility in Sydney. Leonas Petrauskas drove me to meet Harry Bailey who fed me an LSD-laced jelly cup containing red candy frogs. The subsequent trip had me"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":" 335 swimming through a green sea of jelly and giant frogs. Bailey administered ECT while Kidman inserted the trigger. I recall being alarmed and thinking: Why are you messing with Comrade Gittinger’s work? Kidman’s Eastern Star pendant I deduce, I could access the celestial judgement hall because my Core programming was laid inter -dimensionally. That is precisely what John C. Lilly discovered, how to lay inter - dimensional programming. Rupturing the Core programming instantly propelled me t o the celestial hall dimension. Remembering the Core split instantly integrated most of my splits. Consequently, when I visited my programming subsequent to this core integration, I rarely encountered any alters but instead found ra cks and racks of their costumes. The programming sets and props were intact, but the characters were gone. I revisited Kidman’s Order of the Eastern Star pentagon room four years later, when my memories of Mengele and the US Embassy were triggered and began pushing through to my conscious mind in the form of emotional, visual and physical flashbacks. I peered behind the pentagon doors again, and discovered that each room contained a door in the far-right rear wall , which led to another room which contained another door, etc. Every room once housed a personality, so each room represented a walled-off cluster of independent neural circuitry. When I drew the five front rooms, I realised they had been trashed. The white door contained a pile of abandoned objects (used as triggers or inductions), instructions, and other paraphernalia. It felt like engaging in automatic writing as I accessed the brain area that held the memory. I drew a fob watch, an hourglass, Kidman’s Eastern Star pentagram pendant, and a Candy Girl dress. The room behind the yellow door contained upturned furniture, and a pile of smashed glass chemistry vials, pill bottles, and books. I drew musical notes to represent melodies that cued programmed drug effects that replaced having to consume the drugs. Graffiti on the left wall read, ‘FUCK YOU ALL!’ The red room contained a smashed altar, books of spells, cauldrons, swastikas, pentagrams and hexagrams, knives and bones.

I was five years old when I was ordered to strip naked before a panel in the loungeroom of Leonas Petrauskas’ Engadine home. Peter Holowczak walked me to the location which was a short distance from his McAlister Avenue house. A group of cult and MK - ULTRA perpetrators including Petrauskas, Gittinger, Kidman and Conlon inspected my flawless white form and asked me many questions about all sorts of things, especially my interests. ‘Do you li ke to be special?’ Gittinger asked. I nodded shyly. ‘ We’ll make you special...’ The men laughed knowingly. Afterwards, I commenced a battery of tests at the underground CIA facility at Holsworthy Army Base. Gittinger administered EEGs, intelligence tests and personality questionnaires. He supervised tests of physical endurance, including running on a tread mill while wearing medical equipment. The team were so pleased with my performance, they rewarded Nanna Holowczak with whitegoods. From then on, Nanna called me her ‘Special girl’ and ‘Purple girl’ and she dressed me in purple outfits. ‘What is your favourite colour?’ nanna constantly asked me. ‘Purple,’ I responded. (Purple was not my favourite colour. My favourite colour is produced by mixing equal parts of phthalo blue and phthalo green. It is the colour I innately gravitated toward during the eye test I did in preparation for tinted glasses.) Pop Holowczak did not share Nanna’s enthusiasm. ‘I’ll give you the special,’ he hissed. Pop dragged me to where he worked cleaning the trains and hoisted me in an agonising inside -out position from the carriage ceiling. ‘Who’s the special now!’ he spat. "},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":" 338 Gittinger laid his base programming at the underground CIA facilities located at Holsworthy Army Barracks and ANSTO Lucas heights. He led me to a laboratory equipped with a hospital bed, EEG machine, video screens, and ECT and all the necessary gear for torturing and splitting a child. There Gittinger and his trainees, including Kidman, subjected me to an application of John Bowlby’s Attachment research: 439 a) Attachment behaviour is directed towards one or a few specific individuals, usually in clear order of preference. b) An attachment endures, usually for a large part of the life cycle. Although during adolescence early attachments may attenuate and become supplemented by new ones, and in some cases are replaced by them, early attachments are not easily abandoned, and they commonly persist. c) Many of the most intense emotions arise during the formation, maintenance, disruption, and renewal of attachment relationships. The formation of a bond is described as falling in love, maintaining a bond as loving someone, and losing a part ner as grieving over someone. Similarly, threat of loss arouses anxiety and actual loss gives rise to sorrow; while each of these situations is likely to arouse anger... d) The more experience of social interaction an infant has with a person the more likely he is to become attached to that person... Attachment behaviour remains readily activated until near the end of the third year; in healthy development it becomes gradually less readily activated thereafter. e) An attachment can develop despite repeated punishmen t from the attachment figure. f) Attachment behaviour is mediated by behavioural systems which are activated by certain conditions (e.g., strangeness, hunger, fatigue, fright) and terminated by other conditions (e.g., cuddling). Gittinger wiped my natural attachment to my mother by electrocuting me with multiple cattle prods. W hen I screamed for my mother he said, ‘Mummy doesn’t love you. I love you.’ Gittinger then applied B.F. Skinner’s conditioning research. He paired my cries for my mother with vomiting, poured Ipecac down my throat and said, ‘Mummy let us do this to you.’ Gittinger then implemented Seligman’s ‘Inescapable Shock’ research. He connected me to an EEC and electrocuting me with multiple cattle prods. He overwhelmed my senses by simultaneously showing me virtual reality scenes of death, violence and destruction, and delivering painful screeching sounds via a metal probe inserted into my right ear. He continued this until I dissociated from the pain and exhibited the desired brainwave pattern. ECT, the invention of Dr Ugo Cerletti, another Spanish fascist, was often applied to various parts of the body, Wolf says, ‘usually the physical places that do not readily show or in tissue that heals quickly.’ High technology was combined with drugs, hypnosis and torture to create alter personalities. Years before Silicon Valley introduced virtual-reality computerware, children by the score told therapists they’d been forced to wear goggles that flashed 3 -D images of horror and death. 440 439 John Bowlby (1977).

Gittinger reattached me to the cult family, principally himself and my substitute mother (the Grande Dame) via love bombing and sexual assault. Patricia Anne Conlon secured the new attachment bond by breast feeding me like a baby and sexually assaulting me at the same time. Gittinger sexually assaulted me during his Candy Land programming. Candy Land Program Having stripped me of my sense of self, Gittinger filled the void with a sense of ego and pride. He did this using Candy Land programming. I walked beside Gittinger through a Candy Land, along a path lined with giant candy canes that led to a distant castle. Inside the Candy Land castle, Gittinger sat me on a throne inscribed with the title Princess . He placed a crown on my head and a serpent sceptre in my hand. He repeated : ‘You are the chosen one. You are royalty. You are special. You are of the ruling class. . .’ This was Princess and P ride programming, designed to instil pride in my high IQ, Luciferian bloodline , and Grande Dame candidacy. I used to think Gittinger used a life -size Candy Land set with props, but today as mainstream technology catches up with the top-secret military technology that I experienced decades ago, I conclude it is plausible the military had the technology to produce a virtual reality Candy Land. I saw ‘Disney, ’ ‘Candy Land’ and ‘©’ printed on the side of a video cassette tape or box. "},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":" 341 One of my therapy drawings from the Candy Land castle featured a treasure chest containing a key. This was a secret back door to my programming that Gittinger installed. He kept this secret from Antony Kidman whom he rightly described as a ‘fucking idiot ’ following a critical incident when I was 10 years old. My mother spent most of my tenth year in hospital due to lead poisoning. I consequently spent all holidays and weekends at my evil grandparents’ Engadine home. I have relatively little memory of that time due to the cult’s unprecedented access to me. I was repeatedly electrocuted and raped in a laboratory beneath ANSTO Lucas Heights at different developmental milestones. Gittinger used me to demonstrate the technique to a team of trainees dressed in white lab coats, including Antony Kidman. First, I was electrocuted until I became still. ‘The subject is now ripe for programming,’ Gittinger explained, as he lifted and dropped my limp arm. Then e veryone left the room while Kidman stood at the bottom of the hospital bed and raped me. He flapped my limp legs together like butterfly wings as he penetrated me. Following this, Gittinger electrically stimulated specific parts of my brain to create implicit behavioural responses. Maintenance I have detailed memories of revisiting the ANSTO lab and experiencing a variation of this process every two years, at ages six, eight, 10, 12 and 14 years. This was to compensate for developmental changes in my body and brain. The session at age 14 ended with security prying my fingers from Kidman’s crimson throat after he clumsily electrocuted my head. "},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":" 342 John Gittinger’s programming was maintained outside the labs by regular rape and trauma perpetrated by the Holowczaks and their Luciferian cult associates. The murders seemed endless. I was forced to watch the ritual murder of a group of children in bushland near the dog breeder’s home on Old Illawarra Road. The dog breeder and his close associate Ivan Milat tossed the kids off a cliff in broad daylight. Overcome with grief and fed up with the nightmare year that had been, I spontaneously decided to follow them. I ran and went to leap over the cliff edge – only to be stopped at the last minute by Milat who risked his life to tackle and catch me. If I had died, all in attendance would have paid with their lives – and they knew it. Like Gittinger said, I was a ‘ National Asset.’ Gittinger was urgently called to Australia to repair my programming. His dilemma was, the person who attempted suicide was not an alter that could easily be deactivated or disposed of. It was the real me and my memories from that year. Gittinger had to perform psychological surgery and reassign that part of me as his Gatekeeper. His remedy consisted of flatlining my heart to bring it under submission. Gittinger explained, the heart, being connected to the visual and emotional side of the brain, has its own intrinsic nervous system that processes information independently of the brain. Consequently, although my handlers had control of my mind, my heart overruled my brain and made the decision to escape . Incidentally, it is the heart’s intrinsic nervous system which allows a transplant to work. In a heart transplant recipient, the nerve connections between the donor heart and the recipient’s brain do not immediately connect. Meanwhile, the transplanted heart relies solely on its intact nervous system. The heart’s intrinsic nervous system explains why a transplant recipient sometimes adopts the donor’s memories and personality characteristics. In fact, murders have been solved based on the recipient’s access to the donor’s final memories housed in the donated organ. After prepping me with torture, Gittinger reassigned 10-year-old Intellectual Alice as Gatekeeper over his Wonderland foyer. Alice in Wonderland programming looks exactly like the Disney movie. I deduce that for most victims, Wonderland programming is triggered via"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":" 343 sodomy – which is what the rabbit hole represents, the anal pas sage that the white rabbit (programmer) penetrates. However, Gittinger secretly changed my trigger to vaginal rape, to prevent ‘fucking idiot ’ Antony Kidman accessing and ruining his programming, which he eventually did. Alice in Wonderland Program To access Gittinger’s Wonderland program during therapy, I visualized falling backwards through the rabbit hole with 10-year-old Intellectual Alice in hand. I knew the landing on the floor below to be hard and painful, so I said to Alice, ‘The landing doesn’t have to be hard. We can make it soft because we are in our head and can control what happens in our head.’ We landed on a black-and-white checkered foyer floor. The foyer walls were green (the colour of intelligence, favoured by high IQ people). A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling. Five coloured doors were placed in the usual sequence from left to right – green, blue, red, white, yellow. Gatekeeper Intellectual Alice was able to unlock the doors, but not cross the threshold of any except the green one. (I deduce Alice was granted access to the green door to stop her going crazy with boredom.) The green door accessed the Wonderland set and characters people are familiar with, including the Mad Hatter’s tea party and the Queen of Hearts’ castle grounds. Various sections of the set were used for programmes. For example, the chessboard scene provided opportunity for storing programming using chess language (D4, A2, etc). "},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":" 344 "},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":" 345 Four keys were hidden in Gittinger’s Wonderland foyer. These were decorated according to the four playing card symbols: hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades. I asked Intellectual Alice to locate the key to the green door, which she did. Alice unlocked the door and I accompanied her to the fully laden Tea Party. I used my counselling skills to communicate with Alice and win her trust. I asked her, ‘Have you ever actually sampled this spread?’ She shook her head. I suggested, ‘Why don’t you pour yourself a cup of tea? You like watching the way the tea comes out of the spout and into the cup. I know that because I am you.’ We watched the black tea arc into the cup. Then I said, ‘Why don’t you eat something? Go on, try a doughnut. I know they’re your favourite.’ After we returned to the foyer, Intellectual Alice retrieved a second key from beneath a mat in front of the red door. She opened the door and released six-year-old Ritual Alice. Ritual Alice stood on Intellectual Alice’s shoulders to retrieve a third key hidden in the chandelier. Ritual Alice opened the blue door to release 14-year-old Soldier Alice. ( All three versions of Alice were created at the ages I interacted with Gittinger.) Wizard of Oz Program Together, the three Alice splits opened the white door to reveal a cloud of hypnosis from which 12-year-old Dorothy of Oz emerged . Dorothy held a fourth key in her right pocket. All four keys were designed according to playing cards (Hearts, Clubs, Spade s, D iamonds). Dorothy opened the final, yellow door containing the yellow brick road to Emerald City. The alters locked arms and followed the yellow brick road. Obstacles avoided on the way included: poison apples, winged monkeys, Tin Man (a trigger for memories of axe murders), Cowardly Lion (fear program), Scarecrow (burnt alive program), and the Poppy Fields (sleep program). Upon reaching the Emerald City gate, I tapped a sequence and sang a five -note tune to gain entry. Once inside, the spiral turned green. We boarded the carriage pulled by the horse that changes colours. We avoided the Wizard (another trap) plus the Ruby Slippers – the final trap. Once we reached the end of the spiral, Glinda appeared in a floating bubble. Glinda is the final programmed alter. Glinda is the Grande Dame program ming attached to the Disney Princess programming laid in Candy Land and Disneyland. Gittinger laid Princess plus Alice in Wonderland programming at Disneyland in Anaheim, California when I was six years old. That is why I was dressed like Alice, drugged, placed on the It’s a Small World boat ride, and spun on the Mad Hatter Tea Party Ride until I vomited. Disney Princess Program The route from Emerald City to Glinda’s Crystal Castle functioned like a computer game. It passed through the woods containing cottages occupied by twins Snow White and Rose Red plus the Seven Dwarfs, and by Rapunzel’s tower. Glinda’s castle contained five doors of Gem programming laid out in the usual colour arrangement: green (emerald), blue (sapphire), red (ruby), white (diamond), and yellow (topaz). Behind t he emerald door, Sleeping Beauty (Briar Rose) lay asleep on a bed. At her feet sat the wardrobe from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe . A key stored in drawers beside Briar Rose’s bed unlocked the wardrobe. The wardrobe led to a Snow Queen seated in a unicorn -pulled sleigh that transported me to an Ice Castle. A spell had to be broken to melt the castle, making this route a trap. "},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":" 346 Returning to Glinda’s Crystal Castle, behind the sapphire door Snow White lay on a bed in a coma. A small chest at the foot of her bed contained a key to a second wardrobe which led to Maleficent’s castle. Behind the ruby door was an imprisoned Cinderella. The diamond room was filled with shimmering l ight that morphed into the Swan Princess Ophelia. Finally, the topaz room contained a throne room occupied by the Grande Dame ‘ spirit ’ that Patricia Ann Conlon passed to me at her dying breath. Alice, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Dorothy, and Snow White all wear pale royal blue, consistent with their Princess-in-training status. The purpose of Princess programming is to teach the victim that the end justifies the means . To explain, every Disney Princess character loses her mother, father, or both. Each endures hardship of some kind, usually at the hands of a wicked stepmother (including the original Sleeping Beauty who suffered an evil mother - in-law). But at the end of their ordeal, each princess marries a prince and becomes Queen. In a cult context, this story line translates into the journey a Grande Dame candidate undertakes. The child victim’s attachment to their birth parents is severed and they are reattached to a Grande Dame and a new ‘Family’ who put the victim through a gruelling, torturous training regime. The moral to the story is, the trauma and torture the Princess suffers during her trials or training, all becomes worth it the end when she is rewarded by being crowned Queen (Grande Dame). The Queen in t urn becomes the next perpetrator, indicated by her dark alte rs or roles including the Evil Queen and Maleficent.

Michael Aquino, and John W. Gittinger, who were trained directly by Operation Paperclip’s most clandestine recruit, Joseph Mengele. Dulce lab technicians strapped my naked body to a chair, plastered large electrode pads to my back and limbs, and attached a Medusa-mass of EEG electrodes to my head. My brain splits were colour-labelled: Green, Blue, Red, White, Yellow. For each colour, Dr West held a large sheet of coloured card in my face while a computer repeated the name of the colour: ‘Red. Red. Red. Red. Red...’ I was simultaneously electrocuted until my senses were overwhelmed and I surrendered my will to the insertion of their instruction. They stopped torturing me once they recognised the desired brainwave pattern on their monitors. Beyond Dr West’s surgery door lay a foyer with five coloured doors in the standard order. The green room contained shelves of books. I identified this as Gittinger’s Test Library. One of the books had the title, Nuances of Psychological Testing . The blue room contained an armoury of guns, grenades, knives and other weapons. It also contained maps and racks of soldier costumes. The red room contained an occult library including books of spells, an altar, a skull, candles, and a voodoo doll. The white room contained racks of Disney costumes. The yellow room contained a pharmacy with books, drugs and chemistry lab equipment. This pocket of neural circuitry contained memories of drugs’ mechanism of action, so that drug effects could be produced without physically administering the drug.

Five coloured doors were arranged in an arc, lit dramatically from above. A large rug on the floor was decorated in an enormous Rothschild family crest, featuring a shield flanked by two animals on their hindquarters. Behind the green door lay an Auschwitz library. The blue room was full of shooting energy and a stargate, and it contained the Gateway Process. The red room was a ritual storeroom containing shelves of Luciferian books and potions. The white room contained racks of priestess robes. The yellow room contained a laboratory with research equipment, cages, and a creepy, mute lab assistant. It was Mengele’s Milson Island lab. Dr Aquino The creepy lab assistant was the only one who could open the door to Dr Aquino’s foyer that was decorated with a Freemasonic checkered floor and five coloured doors.

This was a backdoor to Oz which linked to Gittinger’s yellow door. "},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":" 349 Grande Dame The waiting room elevator provided Patricia Ann Conlon access to Gittinger’s Grande Dame and Princess programming. The elevator accessed five floors of the Grande Dame training system. The blue floor contained leadership training including systems analysis and strategy, psychology and behaviour prediction, delegation, manipulation and motivation of subordinates’ personality types, and maintaining distance from subordinates. The green floor pertained to training in academics and the arts, including classical music, history, English, theatre, painting and philosophy. The white floor related to temple prostitute instruction in the art of sex and seduction. The yellow floor pertained to teaching and supervision of cult children, such as lessons in occult knowledge delivered via nursery rhymes. For instance, Mary Had a Little Lamb represents the Christian child lured into the cult without parental awareness. The red floor was devoted to training in sorcery, ritual murder, and clandestine assassination via the ‘ kiss of death.’ The elevator accessed castles belonging to the Grande Dame’s two faces, Glinda and Maleficent. Maleficent’s thorny castle gr ounds were occupied by the Dragon she transformed into. The Disney dragon form of Maleficent represents the Ouroboros. The Ouroboros symbolises the life cycle of the Grande Dame’s eternal spirit. This is achieved by the Grande Dame willingly submitting to ritual sacrifice at the hands of her successor who draws in her final breath. This tradition is considered a form of rebirth, the circle of life, and a means of attaining immortality, which is related to the Ouroboros symbolising alchemy. Immortality via transhumanism is the true goal of alchemy. This process of the serpent eating its own tail is reflected in the standard Disney Princess or traditional fairytale ending where the abusive queen-stepmother -witch, dies at the hands of the princess who assumes her kingdom, role , identity , persona - alters.

The castle contains the Grande Dame’s throne room and a robe room with costumes displayed on mannequins. The costumes consisted of high-collared purple robes worn by Disney’s Maleficent and the Evil Queen. Each wore a gold crown and a ruby. Another costume was a red and purple ritual robe and a headpiece that was a cross between a top hat and a fez. Each outfit represents a personality or role. The Disney outfits mimicked those worn in real-life by Grande Dames officiating over rituals and ceremonies. Purple indicates cult royalty and symbolises rarity. The ruby symbolises sexuality and exclusivity. The Intruder I once had a mind-controlled therapist who was handled by a pharmacist from Adelaide. He was the latest in a string of abusive boyfriends. This therapist (and her Satanist colleague ) simultaneously undermined my efforts to integrate. The worst occasion of sabotage occurred when my therapist pressured me to visit an Adelaide couple who advertised themselves as Christian pastors, and SRA and mind control experts with 20 years of experience integrating DID victims. David and Raelene Thompson established ‘Watchman Ministries’ in 1992, at the height of SRA victim disclosure. The couple were recommended to me by Pastor Doug Riggs in the USA . Although I sensed something was wrong, I pursued the excursion because my therapist manipulated my emotions. ‘Do it for me,’ she implored. I warned my therapist I might not see her again and departed for Adelaide in mid-May. I knew the trip was going to be interesting when I exited the plane and felt two massive invisible beings escorting me through Adelaide airport. I was collected by David and his obese wife, who drove me to my accommodation in the remote Adelaide hills. The Pastor and his wife spent the first few days grooming me. Every night they took me to dine in a nice restaurant. Each morning they drove me to a remo te function centre for ‘deprogramming’ sessions that ran all day. They spent the first three days mapping the system of alters and identifying their names and roles. David asked me questions that I answered honestly and freely, while the wife took copious notes. It happened on the fourth morning. David asked me to list a group of related personality fractures. I closed my eyes and effortlessly rattled off the information. ‘Hang on!’ he puzzled. ‘ Do you remember everything that was just said?’ ‘Yes, ’ I shrugged. David Thompson’s façade of kindness and gentleness suddenly gave way to contempt and rage. He swept his hand across pages of notes and diagrams. ‘ I’ve never seen this! ’ Me: ‘ Seen what?’ ‘This!’ He planted his finger on the notes, ‘ This combination!’ ‘What? Military mind control and ritual abuse? Why is it so hard to believe? Holsworthy was next door to Engadine BoysTown. It’s physically possible. ’ He shook his head. ‘ I’ve never seen any of this before! ’ ‘Well,’ I offered, ‘I was programmed directly by the world’s best. I was chosen from a pool of chosen ones. I was selected because of my unique combination of visual-spatial processing capacity, psychic ability, creativity, physical endurance, and Aryan features. Perhaps you haven’t encountered this before because I was the only one? ’ Fury washed over his face. It was quiz time. ‘What’s the difference between Monarch and MK -ULTRA?’ he demanded. ‘Oh, I don’t care, ’ I shrugged. It’s all the same crap .’"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":" 351 ‘No, it’s not! See, you don’t know anything!’ I squared my shoulders - and focussed. He asked: ‘ Do you enjoy sex with your husband?’ ‘Oh, I’m completely normal in that department.’ ‘If you were a genuine victim, ’ he spat, ‘ you would be sexually dysfunctional! ’ I just looked at him. No comment. Filthy prick . You’re a programmer. You’re trying to shock me into dissociating. . . Stay calm. Don’t react. We’re getting out of here. David threw his hands in the air like a bad actor. ‘I’m cancelling this session! I’m going to have do some research, call some people. We’ll resume tomorrow.’ ‘Sure, ’ I lied. The couple drove me back to my secluded accommodation. There I phoned my mother who started praying. Then I phoned Jon, told him what had just occurred, and asked him whether he would not mind if I spent my remaining days in Adelaide sightseeing. I convinced my husband and Adelaide hosts that I was going to visit the Barossa. Jon called back and told me a hire car was booked and waiting for me at the airport. Then I phoned my therapist’s office and left a message: ‘He’s a military programmer. He’s after the access codes. I’m at risk and making a run for it.’ I was on a train when my therapist returned my call. ‘I’ll be alright, ’ I assured her. ‘I’ve been in this situation many times. My training has kicked in and I know what to do.’ I navigated my way to the airport and boarded the first flight home. David Thompson worked for the Australian military in an Adelaide division relevant to MK-ULTRA. The irony is, I ultimately used him to map and process my programming, which helped me integrate, since conscious awareness ruptures the programming. All anyone had to do was ask me questions and I would spew forth copious amounts of information. The first time I recall something is the most lucid it will ever be, then the detail fades over time. I had trouble recalling the entire system that I internally mapped in Adelaide over three days. I jotted down the following informa tion a week or so later . As you will see from the overview of my programming matrix, its complexity make s it near impossible for victims and therapists to identify and break. I must reiterate , the programming used on me does not serve as a blueprint for un ravelling another individual’s programming. No two cases are the same. The perpetrators may use the same scripts, movies, songs and stories, yet two children will do different things with the same base material. The more a child’s imagination contributes to the program, the better the program sticks. Once when Gittinger wanted to create layering in a program, he asked me to think of something layered. I chose a layered cake. He then asked me to describe the cake in detail. I described layers of sponge, cream and fruit. Because Gittinger employed an image that my brain naturally gravitated toward, it provided a better chance of the program sticking. Each program also varies according to the perpetrator’s expertise level. Programming is an art which a skilled genius like Gittinger can get right, or a ‘fucking idiot’ like Antony Kidman can get very wrong.

I had been here before, in this exact location. ‘I want my Mummy,’ I mumbled as tears welled in my eyes. I was dissociating, remembering. I turned and surveyed the room again. The furniture had been moved about but otherwise it all looked familiar. I dropped into a chair which faced the same direction as when I sat on ‘Uncle Gough’s’ lap. I struggled to fathom the enormity of what I was seeing. The outlay of the green room next door was precisely as I had drawn it in therapy. The green leather couch was the very piece of furniture I was raped on over 40 years ago. A small group of people burst through the doorway. Their jovial guide took a seat beside me and offered , ‘You can join us if you like!’ He continued rattling off facts and personal anecdotes about Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke who both used this very office while serving as Prime Minister . There was too much respect and admiration in his tone. ‘Stop!’ I interjected. ‘I can’t take this.’ I rose to my feet and continued. ‘These men are not heroes. They’re all pedophiles! They are chosen for these positions because they are pedophiles. ASIO trafficked kids here for their pedophile orgies. I was raped by Gough Whitlam right here in this room when I was a child, and I was raped in a pedophile orgy in that green room in there, and again in the red room down the hall.’ I went to leave .

She also taught me how to fuck. Grande Dame selection criteria include Aryan Root Race features: blue or green eyes, blonde or red hair, flawless complexion, physical beauty, creativity, and high intelligence. Grande Dames are bisexual temple whores with a preference for sex with young teenage girls. They are glorified madams who train children for prostitution. By age six I was a trained courtesan.

He personally delivered me to the pedophile orgy at Parliament House when I was six years old. We rode in a posh black car with silver trim and brown leather interior. It was driven by two security men with neat military style haircuts and black suits. I was dropped off at the rear entrance of what is now Old Parliament House. Gittinger accompanied me to the rear entrance where I was met by a servant dressed in a long-tailed tuxedo, then he returned to the nearby US consulate .

Bob Carr attended the previous year . FOI released documents show, Beazley expressed interest in attending Bohemian Grove again in 2014. The same documents reveal, the US government emailed our Department of Foreign Affairs (24 July 2012) regarding ‘media talking points’ and suggested responses to inquiries regarding Carr and Beazley’s Bohemian Grove attendance . Here is their suggested response : If asked: Why did you attend the Bohemia Grove conference – an event often linked to conspiracy theories – in San Francisco? • The Bohemia Grove conference provided the opportunity to engage with key US figures, including former US Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger, James Baker and George Shultz, and representatives of major American investors in Australia. • The conference followed separate talks with former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice at the Stanford School of Business [18 July]. This document was in reaction to the PR nightmare caused by Bob Carr’s 18 July 2012 tweet: Lunch with Condie Rice at Stanford, dinner tonight with [Henry] Kissinger and [George] Shultz. Then off with them to conference at Bohemian Grove. A Washington Post article introduced Bohemian Grove as follows: Every July, some of the richest and most powerful men in the world gather at a 2,700 acre campground in Monte Rio, Calif., for two weeks of heavy drinking, super -secret talks, druid worship (the group insists they are simply ‘revering the Redwoods’ ), and other rituals . 442 A more accurate description would be: ‘Every year, elite male Luciferian pedophile s gather for a 16-day Bacchanalia-flavoured summer camp featuring drunken orgies, child hunts, and ritual human sacrifice to pagan gods.’ Peter Alexander Chernoff said he he lped the Luciferian cult abduct a 10 -year-old boy named Kevin Collins from San Francisco. He later witnessed San Francisco-based Michael Aquino ritually sacrifice the child at Bohemian Grove in the presence of George Bush Senior (a Nazi), Pope Ratzinger (a former Nazi), and Omaha businessman Warren Buffet who was implicated in the Franklin VIP child trafficking scandal. Famous Bohemian Grove attendees include Clint Eastwood, Ronald Reagan, and Richard Nixon. People assume the word Bohemian stems from the club’s artistic origins. The true origin of this name formed the basis of my 2016 article Bohemian Grove, Pedo Hunting Parties and Rent Boy Ranch , written in the wake of USA Chief Justice Antony Scalia’s untimely death.

An Omaha child trafficking and ritual abuse victim, Shurter describe d USA Chief Justice Scalia as a violent Luciferian pedophile. When news broke of Scalia's odd death, the judge’s former victims got talking. News spread fast among this group that Scalia had in fact been murdered by a 13-year-old boy at a Texan ranch. The child victim was apparently triggered by Scalia's sadistic approach to rape - and slit his perpetrator's throat. This version of events might explain why Scalia's family refused an autopsy, why a Texan judge ruled his death ‘natural causes’ without even viewing the body, and why the FBI declined to investigate Scalia’s death after the marshals told them he died of natural causes. This scenario gains credibility when we consider the history of the Cibolo Creek property where Scalia died. An article in Veterans Day online magazine originally referred to the property as, ‘ Rent Boy Ranch, playground for Mick Jagger and Charlie Sheen. ’ The article was promptly blocked in the USA and later edited to exclude any reference to it being a pedophile establishment. So, what is it about this property, and why was it nicknamed ‘Rent Boy Ranch’? Cibolo Creek Ranch is a 30,000-acre VIP resort located in west Texas, 100 miles from the Mexican border, in the Chinati Mountains. Guests arrive by private jet at the Ranch’s own private airport, and they typically include politicians, businessmen, and Hollywood figures like Mick Jagger, Bruce Willis, Tommy Lee Jones, Randy Quaid, Dick Cheney, and Charlie Sheen. The owner of Cibolo Creek Ranch, John Poindexter, bought the property in 1988. A third-generation Texan, Poindexter runs a Houston-based manufacturing company. He is also a leader in an elite, all-male hunting club called the International Order of Saint Hubertus . This secret society was founded in the Kingdom of Bohemia (Czech Republic) in 1695 by Austrian Count Franz Anton von Spork. Membership is invitation only, and titles held within the society sound Freemason-like: Grand Master, Prior, Knight Grand Officer. The International Order of Saint Hubertus frequently attend hunts hosted by Poindexter at the Cibolo Creek Ranch. In 2010, 53 members of the International Order of Saint Hubertus gathered at Cibolo Creek Ranch to hunt. Guests included members of the Houston chapter and from Mexico, and minor European royalty like Archduke Andreas Salvatore Hapsburg-Lothrengin (Prince of Tuscany, Hungary and Bohemia). Hapsburg- Lothrengin is of the Hapsburg dynasty who owned Židlochovice Chateau located in Austro- Hungaria (Czech Republic) and developed it into a VIP hunting manor. In 2006, prominent Washington lawyer C. Allen Foster, who holds a leadership position within the Order of Saint Hubertus , hired Židl ochovice Chateau for a 40-guest hunting party. C. Allen Foster and Chief Justice Antony Scalia chartered a private plane together with the intention of hunting at Cibolo Creek Ranch the following day. Two other private planes that landed at Cibolo Creek Ranch for the fatal weekend were linked to two other men who held leadership positions with the Texas chapter of the Order of Saint Hubertus. Following Scalia’s death, Poindexter told reporters that he m et Scalia at a ‘sports group’ gathering in Washington. The US Order of Saint Hubertus branch headquarters are in Washington D.C.

In 1966, the USA branch of the Bohemian-founded all-male secret Order of Saint Hubertus (aka the American Knights ) held its first ever meeting at the all-male secret Bohemian Club in San Francisco.

Their robes were taller with pointier caps compared to the Australian ones. My next memory is of being hunted for fun in the woods. A group of children and I were dressed in teddy bear costumes. We were instructed to hide amongst the redwood forest so that the guests could seek us. The hunt occurred at night while the song Teddy Bears’ Picnic played over loudspeakers hung throughout the forest. Those who got caught were raped through openings in their costumes. They screamed for their mothers as they were decapitated. My furry suit complete with ears, made me look like an Ewok in the Star Wars series ; hence I found the film scene triggering. The Simpsons voice actor Harry Shearer (who started out as a child actor) attended Bohemian Grove and made a 2002 movie about this called, Teddy Bears' Picnic . During an interview, Shearer dismissed the Grove’s Cremation of Care ritual as a bit of harmless fun.

In typical Grande Dame style, Streep is a red-haired bisexual who prefers sex with 14-year-old girls. I know because that is the age at which I was trafficked to her. I have not found a photo of the Hollywood house I was trafficked to. From memory, it was decorated in a bland, minimalist, Scandinavian style.

Directly in front of me was a lounge room with giant floor to cei ling windows and a view like in a high-rise apartment. But I think we were simply in a house situated on a steep block that overlooked the Hollywood hills, with a swimming pool directly below on the window . To my left of the front entrance was a wide hall which led smack into double doors. Behind the doors was a bedroom which had an ensuite to the right. The party started with a ritual sacrifice on the dining table over which Streep presided. The victim lay face up on the table while her throat was slit. The blood was drained into a ceremonial bowl, mixed with drugs, and stirred with a brush made of a sprig of herbs. Everyone sipped from the bowl and then the revels began.

Dirty therapists know this, which is why male and female psychologists and psychiatrists commonly access a victim’s sex alters for their own pleasure.

This laboratory will include a special chamber, in which all psychologically significant aspects of the environment can be controlled. This chamber will contain, among other things, a broad -spectrum polygraph for simultaneous recordings of a variety of psychophysiological reactions of the individual being studied. In this setting the various hypnotic, pharmacologic, and sensory-environmental variables will be manipulated in a controlled fashion and quantitative continuous recording of the reactions of the experimental subjects will be made .

Lilly compared the human mind to a bio- computer installed with programs that can be erased, modified and created. We are all born with ‘programs’ like eating, sleeping, and feeling pain ingrained in our genetic code. ‘Meta- programming’ is our ability to learn new information and dev elop ideas beyond these innate programs. Here are some quotes from Lilly’s book: I am interested in the processes of finding meta-programs (and methods and substances) which control, change, and create the basic meta -programs of the human computer. ... Certain chemical substances have programmatic and/or meta -programmatic effects, i.e., they change the operations of the computer, some at the programmatic level and some at the meta-programmatic level. Some substances which are of interest at the meta-programmatic level are those that allow reprogramming, and those that allow and facilitate modifications of the meta -programs. [Lilly used LSD for reprogramming, and ethyl alcohol for weakening meta-programming]. ... Programs are carried out by excitation -inhibition-disinhibition patterns among and in neural masses and sheets (for example, the reticular activating-inhibiting system, the reward-punishment systems, the cerebral cortical conditionable systems). 444 John C.

The Gateway Process A military document (dated 9 June 1983) from Lt. Colonel Wayne M. McDonnell was addressed to the Commander of US Army Operational Group at Fort Meade. The document, Analysis and Assessment of Gateway Process , described the physics behind interdimensional astral projection that the military researched and weaponised. Lt.

So . . . parts of this paper will require not only logic but a touch of right brain intuitive insight. To understand the science used to scaffold black ops like the Gateway Process, ditch the left -brain slop they served us at school. Let us start with a short quiz: 1.

Gravity Tesla’s Electric Universe Tesla is the suppressed genius behind JASON technology, not Newton or Einstein. Tesla described the theory of relativity as: A mass of error and deceptive ideas violently opposed to the teachings of great men of science of the past and even to common sense. The theory wraps all the errors and fallacies and clothes them in magnificent mathematical garb which fasci nates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king. Its exponents are very brilliant men, but they are meta-physicists rather than scientists. 445 Proponents of Tesla’s electric universe argue that theoretical physics is math - not science. Number manipulation alone proves nothing. Real physicists test and prove hypotheses via experimentation. Math ought to be reserved for use as a language to record and communicate experimental findings for others to replicate and build upon , not as a substitute for experimental findings. Robert Otey argues that Newton’s theory of gravity and the celestial mechanics is wrong. Newton based his concept that mass creati ves gravity on his adjustment of Kepler’s orbital equation. Newton fabricated a new element in his head called ‘mass’ and added it to Kepler’s equation which was based on Kepler’s observations of the solar system. When Kepler’s equation and Newton’s adjust ed version of Kepler’s equation are applied to the same motions, the sums all tally up the same. This means Newton’s addition to Kepler’s equation was unnecessary and did not prove the existence of ‘mass.’ Otey explains, what Newton and Einstein called gra vity is in fact a product of electricity. When an apple falls to the ground, this is not two masses being attracted to each other based on their mass. Instead, it is an example of electric current constantly seeking rest. The falling apple’s electric vorte x seeks rest in its nearest equipotential (i.e., the earth) . Consistent with this paradigm, Lt. Col . McDonnell’s report on the Gateway Process states: S olid matter, in the strict construction of the term, simply does not exist. Rather, atomic structure is composed of oscillating energy grids surrounded by other oscillating energy grids which orbit at extraordinarily high speeds. . . The point to be made is that the entire human being, brain, consciousness and all is, like the universe which surrounds him. . . an extraordinary complex system of energy fields. The so- called states of matter are actually variances in the state of energy, and human consciousness is a function of the interaction of energy in the two opposite states (motion vs rest) ... 445 New York Times (11 July 1935) p23 c8."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":" 370 The earth is enveloped by an electro- magnetic field, and the interaction between this and the electrical human body is the basis of the Gateway Process. Munroe Institute During the 1950s, the CIA funded Robert Monroe’s development of what is called th e Gateway Experience or Hemispheric Synchronization . You might know it as Astral P rojection. Newspapers and Army documents record that the US Army sent soldiers to Robert Monroe for training in the Gateway Process. I was told by a retired military consultant that 25 years ago standard British Army Military Police training incorporated Remote V iewing which enabled MPs to patrol UK bases located in foreign territories. The Ga teway Process is a method for inducing altered states of consciousness. It is the basis of remote viewing, astral projection, and the weaponization of psychic energy. John Gittinger’s PAS was the main screening instrument for selection into the Gateway Pro cess. The military selected creative and intelligent servicemen as Remote Viewing candidates. This is because high IQ creative people are natural bilateral processors with a strong right hemispheric and visual -spatial learning preference. They are also nat urally intuitive with a hypersensitive nervous system that facilitates learning of the Gateway Process. The Fort Meade document provides a detailed explanation of the physics behind the Gateway Process and its various applications. It begins with explainin g how transcendental meditation, hypnosis, and biofeedback work, and how these three methods relate to hemispheric synchronization : - Hypnosis suppresses the left hemisphere. The left hemisphere screens, sorts and assigns meaning to stimuli before it lets information enter the right brain. Hypnosis disengages this left- brain function and allows direct access to the right hemisphere. The left hem isphere is disrupted via drowsiness, which is why the hypnotherapist initially suggests the client is ‘feeling sleepy. ’ Then stimuli ( including verbal suggestion) are immediately accepted and acted on by the right brain which processes and stores this information unconsciously . For example, suggesting the hypnotized person’s legs are numb generates an electrical reaction that induces a numb feeling. Or, suggesting the person has improved memory causes unused information storage capacity to become available. Hypnosis is used to speed up the early stages of the Gateway Process. - Transcendental Meditation ignores the left hemisphere. The person concentrates on drawing electromagnetic energy up the spinal cord. This creates acoustical standing waves in the cerebr al ventricles which are then conducted to the grey matter in the cerebral cortex in the right hemisphere. These waves stimulate and eventually polarize the cortex. - Biofeedback teaches the left hemisphere to recognize the sensations which indicate the tar geted right hemisphere areas are being accessed. Eventually, the left brain can consciously access areas in the right brain. This method is used to block pain, for example. Biofeedback is used to rapidly reach deep meditative states. "},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":" 371 Hemispheric Synchroni zation is a state of consciousness where the left and right brain hemispheres work together as a whole. The left hemisphere relaxes, which places the body in a virtual sleep state. The EEG patterns of both hemispheres are simultaneously equal in amplitude and frequency. Binaural Beats are used to induce hemispheric synchronization. Binaural beats are two sounds of slightly different frequencies. Each sound is delivered to a different ear and the right brain perceives the difference between the two frequencies. Various sound waves may b e played, depending on the desired brain wave activity to be produced. Altered States of Consciousness (previously called Trance States ) are dissociative states of mind . They are produced by the following esoteric practises: 446 - Kundalini Yoga - Zen Buddhism - Shamanism - Hallucinogenic psychedelic drugs - Medium - Transcendental Meditation - Hypnosis - Biofeedback - Ritual dancing - Ritual drumbeats - Binaural beats - Sensory deprivation. Altered states of consciousness change brain function. They disengage the body from external stimuli, activate internal focus, and reconfigure connectivity between brain areas. The above methods produce the following brain changes : 447 - Shift hemispheric dominance from Left to the Right brain. Simultaneously activate the right hemisphere and deactivate the left. - Increased A lpha wave activity associated with relaxed wakefulness, creativity and free association. - Increased Right brain T heta wave activity, as associated with visual imagery and not drowsiness. - Bilateral increase in Gamma activity . - Synchronized EEG activity between Left and R ight frontal lobes.

Gateway Method The Gateway Process combines Transcendental Meditation techniques and hypnotic suggestion with listening to binaural beats. Different sound frequencies were employed depending on the desired state of consciousness, be it sleep, mental concentration or intuiti on and creativ ity. Training was delivered in the following sequence: 1. Engage in visualisation. 2. Engage in mantra chanting to create resonance. 3. Listen to Binaural Beats. 4. Relax to white noise sounds to suppress the Left brain and stimulate the Right. 5. Manipulate electromagnetic energy travelling through the body. (This is also purported to protect against ‘ entities’ encountered during astral projection.) Astral Projection is practised by many pagan cultures and called by different names: - Buddhist light body - Dream body - Egyptian Ka - Energy body - Hindu body of bliss - Tantric subtle body - Taoist diamond body. Leaving the physical body for astral travel requires three conditions: 1. Induc tion of Left-brain quietness and deep physical relaxation via REM frequencies. 2. Synchronization of brain hemisphere wave patterns. 3. Stimulation of Right hemisphere to gain heightene d alertness. This does interfere with hemispheric synchronisation, but not before the high frequency range necessary for attaining out-of-body status is established. When both brain hemispheres electrically fire at the same rate, this creates a chain reac tion which results in the body oscillating at 7.5 hertz – the same rate the electromagnetic field in our external environment resonates at. This state of vibratory harmony transforms the world and beyond into an extension of the human body. The person’s co nsciousness or soul, which is normally restricted within the confines of the physical body’s regular rate of oscillation, may then transcend the body and move freely outside the physical body, including inter -dimensionally. This process is what esoteric cults term becoming ‘ one with the universe .’ The space - time continuum can be transcended according to the same principle, so that the individual can travel inter -dimensionally. "},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":" 373 Duality of the mind We possess two minds: the explicit (conscious) and implicit (non- conscious). The implicit mind is a separate and distinct entity linked to the Right hemisphere ; h ence the R ight brain side is targeted for stimulation and dominance during the Gateway Process. With training, the impli cit mind may accomplish the following esoteric skills: - Move objects without physical contact (aka telekinesis) - Communicate and receive intelligence via intuition (telepathy or problem -solving) - Gain information about distant places or people (clairvoyance or remote viewing) - Read minds or control them from afar (telepathy) - Predict the future (precognition). The Gateway Process is behind the weaponization of occultic practises including levitation, walking through objects, and psychic warfare. It enables s ubjects to physically choke and throw opponents using their will, and to cause mass destruction to our physical surrounds. Lt. Col. McDonnell alludes to this in his description of ‘Colour Breathing.’ Advanced Gateway Techniques Problem-Solving is where the individual consults interdimensional entities to find solutions to certain problems such as math and physics questions . The answers may strike the individual during the following days. Incidentally, this is what the Nazis, Tesla and Einstein engaged in to find their advanced technologies. Some genius scientists receive their solutions during dreams via this method. Remote Viewing involves the R ight hemisphere’s implicit processing capability coupled with the use of a ‘magic wand’ which the mil itary document compares to the ‘ sceptre ’ carried by ‘monarchs’ for the same purpose of remote viewing . Remote Viewing is a minor skill featured in the Gateway Process, yet it has been used as a smoke screen for the Stargate Project ’s end goal. Colour Breat hing involves focussing on certain colours to activate the body’s own energies. The body’s electromagnetic field draws energy from the earth’s electrostatic field for its own use. Visualisation of colours cue set frequencies and amplitudes because colour i s the result of different light wavelengths. Focussing on blue, for example, instantly reduces swelling in the subject’s body, while red has the opposite effect. Note that red is close to the magenta colour of the lotus flower.

Berkley scientists recorded signals from the brain of a cat while it watched movie scenes, then reconstructed the re corded signals into images which they displayed on a computer monitor. The recorded images were fuzzy but recognizable versions of the movie scenes the cat watched. Here is the university’s 1999 news release regarding their cat experiment: 448 The team recorded signals from a total of 177 cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus - a part of the brain's thalamus that processes visual signals from the eye - as they played a digitized movie of indoor and outdoor scenes for the cat. Using simple mathematical filters, the researchers decoded the signals to generate a movie of what the cat actually saw. The reconstructed movie turned out to be amazingly faithful to the original. ‘This work demonstrates that we have a reasonable understanding of how visual information is encoded in the thalamus ,’ said Yang Dan... Theoretically, if someone could record from many more cells - the lateral geniculate nucleus contains several hundred thousand nerve cells in all - it should be possible to reconstruct exactly what the ani mal sees , she said... Dan sees the demonstration... as a step toward a larger goal of understanding how the entire brain works. The current understanding of how cells in this part of the brain respond to visual stimuli has been pieced together over decades by many researchers working with animals. ‘Our goal is to understand how information is processed in the brain, how it is encoded, ’ Dan said. ‘By working backward, using the firing of nerve cells to reconstruct the original scene, we can see where we have been successful and where we haven't ... We aren't the first to use this decoding technique, but instead of decoding the signals one at a time, we did it simultaneously to get a movie image of what the cat saw...’ ‘We have provided a first demonstration that spatiotemporal natural scenes can be reconstructed from the ensemble responses of visual neurons, ’ the researchers concluded in their journal article. 449 The cat experiment was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the CIA cut -out that funded MK -ULTRA research. 448 Robert Sanders ( 15 October 19 99) N ews Release, University of California. 449 G.B.

Wormholes are hyperspace tunnels through spacetime which connect remote regions in our universe, two different universes, different dimensions, or different times. A stargate is a special class of traversable wormhole with simple physics and flat entry and exit openings. Traversable wormholes allowed Delta soldiers to enter one side of the tunnel, travel through the throat, and exit the other side. Pedowood Propaganda The Stargate Project was ‘officially ’ disbanded in 1995 and declared a waste of time and money. It was subsequently discredited via CIA -funded Hollywood films including Stargate (1994) and Men Who Stare at Goats (2004) . The Stargate Project was in fact highly successful, otherwise the following would not have occurred: (a) The military and CIA continued pumping resources into Stargate for 17 years; (b) The US Army officer in charge of Stargate went on to become President of the Monroe Institute ; and (c) All Stargate scientists continued work in the exact same field. Consider the Stargate film a documentary. The film is loosely based on what was in fact achieved. The Stargate film 1994 release pre -empted the Stargate Project 1995 pretend- dissolution. That was no coincidence. Earlier MK-ULTRA research scaffolded the Stargate Project, including Robert Monroe and John C. Lilly’s work with inducing Altered States of Consciousness , and the investigations into psychic ability by physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff. Their research culminated in teams of MK-DELTA soldiers physically visiting the locations identified by Gateway scouts. Delta teams initially trained in a three -story virtual reality holographic studio before entering the real Stargate and travelling through wormholes to a desert planet. Targ, Puthoff, Lilly, Atwater, and Stubblebine knowingly used and abused children who participated in the Stargate Project either as MK -ULTRA research subjects, or MK-DELTA child soldiers sent on field missions . JASON Project DARPA and the JASON Group were formed in 1958 and 1960 respectively and were responsible for developing the science and technology that scaffolded the JASON Super Soldier Project and the related Looking -Glass and Stargate interstellar travel project. The e lite JASON scientists operated out of Dulce in the USA and Pine Gap in Australia. DNA and reproductive materials collected from child victims at the CIA research facility at ANSTO in Lucas Heights were stored in liquid nitrogen flasks and transported to Pine Gap in central Australia for use in the JASON super soldier genetic engineering project. In 1991, I was an inpatient in Gold Coast Hospital following an overdose. During my medical evaluation with a young female registrar, I pointed to the left side of my lower abdomen and asked, ‘Can they extract eggs from here?’ She drew a diagram and dismissed my concerns as impossible. Yet I remained unconvinced, plagued by the thought that eggs had been extracted from my left ovum. I later recalled the procedure which occur red at the"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":" 377 ANSTO lab beneath Lucas Heights, and the excursion Gittinger took me on to witness the result at Pine Gap. I began speaking of a ‘JASON Project ’ and a ‘JASON Group’ in the early 1990s and was unable to find any reference to either , until Steve McMurray alerted me to a book on super soldiers edited by an ex-officer who works for the Australian Defence Academy . 451 Published after I went public, the book arbitrarily mentioned the following: Perhaps this will be most clearly evidenced by my discussion of DARPA’s JASON project. The JASON project entails the collecting of DNA from military personnel in order to identify genome sequences that define ‘ideal’ soldiers. These genome sequences, the JASON project (2010, p.1) suggests, can be used in order to genetically produce super soldiers. Here are some relevant extracts from the same book : • The modern ‘military human enhancement’ effort draws on the fields of neuroscience, pharmacology, biology, genetics, nanotechnology and robotics... • DARPA’s current unclassified projects focus on... improving cognitive abilities such as memory, attention and awareness through... pharmacological means... enhancing senses such as smell, sight, taste and hearing... altering human metabolism to allow for increased endurance, rapid healing and the digestion of otherwise indigestible materials... • The Beijing Genome Institute (BGI) located in Hong Kong sequenced ‘2,000 school children to look for markers that correlate with educational test scores .’ (p.21) • The next step is to develop a two-way communication interface with the brain. Neuroscience is working hard in decoding the human brain in order to develop a seamless brain-machine interface (BMI) to enhance sensory and motor abilities. Again, scientific re search in this area has been ongoing for decades and a BMI is in reach within years. There are obvious military applications of BMIs: 1. Cognitive augmentation, which alarms soldiers to threats they do not consciously perceive and to respond before a conscious intention is formed, which could cut down effective response times by as much as 7 -8 seconds (Kasanoff 2012); 2. Synthetic telepathy, which would allow soldiers to communicate silently amongst each other or with some distant command post (Piore 2011); and 3. Thought -controlled weapons (for example fighter jets) that take advantage of the grater abilities of the human brain compared to computer vision while significantly reducing human response times to threats (Aym 2010). Indeed, the JASON Group have been wor king on the JASON Project ‘for decades.’ JASON technology is far more advanced than the public are informed.

This suggests Harvard are synthesising human and fallen angel (alien) DNA – as the JASON Group have already done. The JASON Group long ago developed a series of super soldier models . The basic MK-DELTA model was a mind -controlled human whose abilities were enhanced through hypnosis, drugs, sensory deprivation, esoteric means, etc. Another model had abilities enhanced through bio-chipping, bionics, and genetic modification using animal DNA. A more advanced model was a cloned hybrid created with genetic materials taken from human, animal and ‘alien’ specimens. I was of the first model, and I witnessed the other two. Genetically engineered JASON Super Soldiers comprised the CIA terror forces that decimated Syria and other nations during the CIA -orchestrated ‘Arab Spring’ fundamentalist uprising . In 2016, Syria’s representative to the United Nations publicly stated twice that ISIS forces were armed with ‘genetically modified super soldiers’ produced and supplied by the USA. In 2015, 7-foot tall soldiers were filmed beheading 21 Christians in Egypt. These soldiers were described as Caucasian, not Arabic, in appearance . They resembled the super soldiers I saw developed under Pine Gap 45 years ago. The West are not the only ones developing super soldiers. In 2018, Vladimir Putin publicly warned the West that Russia were in the process of developing super soldiers which are ‘ worse than nuclear bombs.’ Relevance of Radioisotopes to MK-ULTRA, DELTA & NAOMI I felt fine when I was falling asleep at 10pm. I awoke at 1am writhing in pain. The ringing in my ears was deafening, and I felt a sudden urge to vomit. ‘Help me!’ I moaned, ‘They’re radiating me!’ I couldn’t escape the escalating nausea and ran outside to vomit. This happened twice. On the second round I threw up bitter bile. I prayed to God to make it stop. I t felt like I was dying... * * * Two days later, during therapy, I realised I had experienced another flashback. For some reason, I was injected with radioisotopes at age 6 years. I can’t recall why, as I don’t think anyone told me. Usually Gittinger would explain what he was doing and why he was doing it as he did it. But I doubt this was the case when they were injecting me. I have a faint image of staff in white lab coats. That’s all. I also recall the words ‘isotopes’ being uttered. I have always associated the term ‘PET scan’ with this experience but can’t tell you why. People commonly assume my abusers used the 20-story underground ANSTO nuclear reactor facility at Lucas Heights due to its high security. No, they used a nuclear reactor site because of the nuclear reactor. Lucas heights nuclear reactor (HIFAR) operated from 1958 to 2007. The reactor was used to create a wide variety of radioisotopes. Radioisotopes were made from materials bombarded by neutrons in the reactor. CIA -ASIO scientists used the"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":" 380 radioisotopes for various purposes relevant to MK -ULTRA, MK -DELTA, MK -NAOMI, and the JASON Project. Here is a list of possible uses of radioisotopes, suggested by my medical doctor friend: Potential options for using radioisotopes with DELTA soldiers 1. Radioisotopes can be used for tracking purposes, possibly from satellites/drones/reconnaissance aircraft. Microchipping is inferior because it is vulnerable to being disabled with electro-magnetism. Rare radioisotopes can be created with a desired half-life (of decades if needs be). These isotopes can be injected into soldiers, allowing a small team to be simultaneously tracked. 2. Discoveries in unique physiology. Radioisotopes can be paired with other molecules (e.g., glucose) in PET, fMRI and CT scanners, to track in real time which par ts of the body (brain, thyroid, adrenal, etc) are up-taking (utilizing) the material. This could be used to determine what specific parts of the brain are active, and to what degree, to determine neurological function when compared to other individuals of known ability level. The brain primarily runs on glucose; therefore, attaching a radioisotope to a glucose molecule and injecting this into the body prior to a scan would allow scientists to see where glucose utilization is occurring specifically. If the u tilization is occurring in the cortical region known as the homunculus, then there could potentially be some information gained about dexterity of the associated regions, especially if the uptake was simultaneously observed in the cerebellum (brain structure at the posterior base of the brain that coordinates movement). There seems to be an almost limitless number of possibilities in determining different aspects of brain function when using this modality. 3. Power generation. With the advent of nanotechnology , it might be possible to inject nano nuclear generators that utilize radioisotopes for fuel to supplement power for super soldiers that would exceed human production limitations. That’s a stretch, but... Radiation in Genetic Engineering & Virus Development I visited my real paternal grandfather in Poland in 1990. While there I noticed the apples growing in my grandfather’s communal garden were deformed, coated in large lumps. When I asked what was wrong with them, Jadek replied, ‘Ah, Chernobyl.’ Later I was watching Polish news on a black and white TV set with the family. A news story featured a rabbit with bird wings. ‘What’s that?!’ I exclaimed. ‘Ah, Chernobyl,’ the family responded, unaffected. My experiences in Poland bothered me. They made me ponder this fact: Radiation can alter the DNA code within any cell. I think this is a major clue to what the CSIRO, which was based at the Lucas heights nuclear reactor, were using radioisotopes for. ANSTO now have cyclotrons as well as reactors, enabling them to develop a wider range of nuclear materials for scientific research purposes. Remember, the CSIRO develop viruses, vaccines, and they genetically engineer plants and animals. Here are some more relevant points to consider:"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":" 381 - Radiation is crucial to studying and manipulating DNA. - Radiation was used to develop x-rays that infer the structure and shape of DNA proteins and the 4 base chemicals. - Radiation severs the chemical bonds that secure DNA strands. - Radioisotopes are used when labelling cloned DNA. - Radioisotopes are used in radioactive labelling techniques that are still extensively applied in gene manipulation experiments. - Radioisotopes provide information about the disease state of a specific illness. - Radioactive nucleotides are used to determine the rate of DNA synthesis. - Radioisotopes are used for DNA sequencing, the process of determining the order of the DNA nucleotides (A, G, C, T). - DNA sequencing is essential to the CRISPR procedure in which genetic code is edited. - DNA can be designed and sequenc ed from the 4 building block chemicals and structured via additive manufacturing methods (i.e., sort of like 3D printing). MK-NAOMI & CRISPR There is more to the Project MK -NAOMI and their viral research than we think. Note that the CRISPR-Cas9 was adapted from a naturally occurring genome editing system in bacteria . The bacteria capture snippets of DNA from invading viruses and use them to create DNA segments (called ‘CRISPR arrays’). The CRISPR arrays let bacteria ‘remember’ the viruses (or closely related ones). To use CRISPR/Cas9, scientists first identify the sequence of the human genome they wish to edit. Then they create a specific Guide RNA to recognise that particular stretch of A -T-G-C in the DNA. The Guide RNA is attached to the DNA cutting enzyme Cas9, and then this complex is introduced to the target cells. It locates the target letter sequence and cuts the DNA. At that point, scientists can then edit the existing genome by either modifying, deleting, or inserting new sequences. It makes CRISPR a cut and paste tool for DNA editing. If you want an indication of what has been occurring at ANSTO and the CSIRO, research the CVs of the scientists employed there, and what they were doing immediately prior to working there (sometimes there is a discrepancy between their previous work, and their ANSTO job description). For instance, some folks are into transfection, the process of artificially introducing nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) into cells, via an alternative means other than viral infection; this alte rs the cells’ properties. Transfection is used to study gene function and regulation, produce transgenic organisms, and as a method of gene therapy. If this is what employees are doing today, this indicates what the Lucas Heights scientists were secretly u p to 40 years ago. Conclusion The relevance of radiation to genetic engineering and virology makes sense of the countless thousands of subjects unwittingly recruited for clandestine radiation experiments performed by MK-ULTRA doctors in the USA, and which became the subject of the 1994 Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments ."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":" 382 The genetic engineering and virology processes I mention here are consistent with the Huxleyan eugenicist / trans-humanist agenda, and my childhood experiences at the CSIRO nuclear reactor facility at Lucas Heights. MK-DELTA Clues I have heard from multiple sources that all modern military recruits are routinely microchipped and subjected to mind control without their conscious knowledge . For instance, my relative and her two friends applied to do a gap year with the Army. My relative’ s application was botched by an administrator and she missed out. Her friends were successful. One described a weird incident that occurred during basic training where her entire group awoke one morning bleeding from the nose. What she described was nasal microchipping. As another example, during my Seattle conference presentation, an audience member told me he did not sleep for a decade due to whatever the US Army did to enhance his capabilities. All DELTA Special Operations soldiers were subjected to MK -ULTRA mind control as children , before formally joining the armed forces as adults. I had the chance to test this notion in 2018 during communication with a currently serving DELTA Special Operations soldier in the USA . I asked Ryan whether he had ever heard of DELTA employing child soldiers. He heard ‘on the grape vine’ that child soldiers were trained, ‘to keep up with the Russians, ’ but that the project ‘went dark.’ When I pressed Ryan for more information, he dissociated and began spewing out semi-coherent references to mind control programming. My military training becomes evident in extreme, life or death situations. I automatically assume command in such a situation, like when we were being chased during the filming of Candy Girl documentary. Steve McMurray noticed that I reminded him of his father who was military trained at Holsworthy. Also, when I associated with a former SAS soldier who shares my background, he innately began responding to me like I was his superior. ALICE & JASON As young teenagers my friends and I would attend Blue Light discos sponsored by our local police. There we added our own chorus lines to charming 80s classics like The Radiators ‘You Give me Head’ and Smokies ‘Living Next Door to Alice.’ Our rendition of the latter went like this: Cause for twenty -four years I've been living next door to Alice. [Crowd: Alice! Who the Fuck is Alice?! ] Twenty-four years, just waitin' for a chance, To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance, Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice. [ Alice! Who the Fuck is Alice?! ] The Alice song bothered me for reasons which are now obvious. It was used as one of my programming songs. ALICE was the name given to every female MK-DETLA child soldier. Hence the ‘Alice in Wonderland’ and ‘Alice Through the Looking-Glass’ programming based on the mescalin-inspired writings of pedophile Lewis Carol. Every male DELTA soldier was code-named JASON. Hence the ‘Jason Bourne’ and ‘Bourne Identity’ predictive programming movie franchise"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":" 383 Holsworthy My therapist waved her fingers back and forth across my eyes. ‘Now just close your eyes and relax.’ I sunk into the leather recliner and did as instructed. I see nothing. . . nothing. . . nothing. . . Then, a picture started forming in my mind. A faint, distant, memory. What’s this? What am I seeing? ‘I’m six. It’s night-time. Black boots. Men. Soldiers. Dragging me on the ground.’ Noooooooo!! Something flung me back in the chair. I leapt around and began clawing my way out backwards. Hole. Hessian bag. Children. Thrown on top of the dead bodies. Warm bodies. Not scared of them. Comfortable. My friends. My therapist lunged forward and tucked my hair behind my ear. ‘Oh, Fiona. Right now, I have more admiration for you than anyone.’ I curled up in a foetal position. ‘ I see a military truck. I see an Asian soldier. He’s angry at me. He didn’t like something I said, and so he put me in a Hessian bag and threw me into a hole in the ground. The hole is full of dead children. Their bodies are warm...’ It took minutes for me to recover. ‘ Are we going to do it again?’ I asked. Therapist nodded. She waved her fingers across my eyes again. I relaxed into the chair as before. ‘I’m cold. Icy. There’s a big freezer room. The Asian soldier, Chan, takes me to the entrance and tells me to go inside and look. I enter. To my right I see frozen carcasses hanging on meat hooks. There’s another one -. . . THAT’S NOT MEAT! It’s a girl! He’s a cannibal! She’s frozen! She’s got long brown hair!’ ‘I knew you were going to say that.’ ‘What the hell! What is this? I need some crayons and paper .’ Therapist fetched some rudimentary art materials, and I drew the faint image to life. I drew the 12-year-old victim with dotted lines drawn on her like a carcass prepared for butchering. I drew the Asian soldier I knew as ‘Colonel Chan’ dressed in Austr alian Army uniform. I called the Colonel ‘Chan’ because that is how his name sounded to a six -year-old child. ‘Colonel Chan’ was in fact Dr Victor Chang, the celebrated Chinese -Australian heart surgeon. Chang coordinated the Australian branch of the CIA’s black -market organ trafficking operation. In 1991, Chang was gunned down in a North Sydney gutter like the common criminal scum he was. Colonel Chang and John Overton, the anaesthetist he graduated medical school with, were attached to Holsworthy’s Health Battalion. John Overton lived next door to Antony Kidman. Victor Chang trained DELTA child and adult soldiers at Holsworthy. Chang conducted the full basic army training I underwent at age six, at a makeshift camp site established in the bushland south of the main entrance. I was collected at night from a Holsworthy side gate on Heathcote Road, in an army Land Rover with a canvas canopy. I was dressed in a mini uniform and dog tags, and I trained and dined with male DELTA soldiers who called me ‘Alice.’ The DELTA training camp included a mess tent and a cold storage room. "},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":" 384   Health Battalion Logo The cold room was the final resting place of Michelle, the 12 -year-old girl I witnessed BoysTown priests kidnap on Heathcote Road near Engadine, then rape and murder beside Woronora weir.

Victor Chang was a sadistic cannibal in charge of training DELTA recruits. All DELTA soldiers are forced to routinely engage in cannibalism. My basic training was the same as adult recruits undergo, plus CIA torture and dissociation methods. I recall being chased barefoot and naked by a dog along a n orange Holsworthy dirt track until I dissociated from the pain. Colonel Chang barked orders at me while his vicious dog ran beside him. He threatened the dog would rape me if it caught me. I believed him because he had already instructed the dog to rape me in a cage. I eventually collapsed with exhaustion.

I wrapped my arms around his neck and whispered into his ear, ‘ I love you, Jason.’"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":" 385 ‘I love you too, pumpkin, ’ he whispered back. Weaknesses were always discovered and eliminated within DELTA . Colonel Chang locked me in a cage located on the bottom floor of a seven-story underground facility remotely located at the south end of Holsworthy Barracks, in an area adjacent to Lucas Heights. There I was imprisoned with a small group of six -year-old children for approximately three days. The p urpose was to make me bond with them so their impending slaughter would have a more traumatic impact. These children were specifically bred for MK -DELTA and they had never seen the outside world. They had not even seen daylight or trees. The group sat like obedient school students and listened intently to my vivid description of the world above. I described the ocean, its coral that looked like an underwater flower garden, and its waves that felt like great walls of water. ‘We heard this!’ the children exc laimed. ‘ The Light Man told us this! ’ ‘Who is the Light Man?’ I asked. They described how the Light Man sometimes visited their cage and told them stories about nature. ‘Oh!’ I realised. ‘ I know Him! That’s Jesus!’ Colonel Chang slaughtered the children in front of me with a machete and threw the ir bodies into a hole in the ground. Chang told me I was next. He tied me inside a hessian bag and threw me on top of the warm bodies. I didn’t mind being close to my little friends. I was reunited with these children four years later, during a near -death experience. It occurred while Gittinger flat-lined me at age 10. I found myself in a celestial garden. I heard laughing and children’s voices coming from behind a thicket of bushes in front of me. I walk ed through the foliage to reach a clearing in which a group of children were playing, cartwheeling, holding hands and dancing in a circle. They were clean, healthy, and dressed in white linen. They had aged four years. ‘Fiona!’ they yelled. Real-Life Hunger Games DELTA soldiers were programmed with unquestioning obedience and endurance. These qualities were achieved through training exercises focussing on survival of the fittest and elimination of the weakest. Training included real-life hunger games in which the weakest DELTA and regular Army recruits were killed by members of their own unit, and cannibalised. I recall several of these gut-wrenching exercises that occurred when I was 14 years old. One took place on the nearby Woronora Dam. Two dinghies full of soldiers hugg ed the far west bank. I was in the rear vessel when we were ambushed. Everyone in the front boat was mowed down by gun fire coming from the nearby bush. At this, I instinctively called for the boys in my boat to dive and swim underwater toward a rocky point to our back left. There we realised the weakest half of our team had been intentionally grouped in the front boat. On another occasion, we were forced to hunt down a skinny young regular soldier who went by the nickname ‘Skippy.’ He was a simple, goofy-looking, harmless guy who worked as a cook. He wore camouflage trousers, an army cap over his brown hair, but for some reason he was dressed in a white singlet. Skippy was violently murdered in the Aussie bush by Aussie soldiers who pounced on him like wild animals, sliced open his chest, and pulled out his still beating heart."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":" 386 Then I was ordered to select one soldier from my unit to challenge in a real-life round of hunger games. ‘Hunt or be hunted!’ I was told. I chose the weakest target, ‘Jason-6.’ We were released at dusk. I recall scrambling up a tree with a knife between my teet h and patiently waiting there for Jason to creep past in the expected hunched posture . I leapt onto him with the knife aimed at the back of his neck. Game over. My next memory is of being coated in blood, reaching up to the sky and screaming hysterically. My next memory is of being curled up in a foetal position in the corner of a concrete Holsworthy cell , mentally cracking. My next memory is of Anne Conlon arriving and yell ing, ‘Alice!’ at me . My most painful DELTA memory occurred on the spa mat in a gym constructed beneath Holsworthy. Our unit were lined up along the edge of the blue mat. I had just returned from Dulce where I trained under Aquino. The commander paired me up with my favourite Jason, the one who cared for me for eight years. I dislocated his shoulder during the ensuing wrestle. The boys laughed at Jason who groaned on the mat. I retired to the drinks cart for refreshments, glad that was over . The Commander approached me and quietly uttered those dreaded words: ‘Finish him of f.’ I eyeballed him fleetingly , swallowed my objection, rushed over to the mat where Jason lay moaning, grabbed him by the head, and snapped his neck. Silence. Not him! we all thought but dared not utter. My therapist once commented, ‘You never cry in therapy. In fact, I think you’re the only one of my clients who doesn’t cry.’ I cried for the first time at the memory of killing Jason. I convulsed with mourning and remorse as I remembered seeing his pretty young brunette wife at Holsworthy, dressed in red, flanked by two small children. Evidence of my DELTA training leaked into my regular life on two occasions. The first incident occurred at school when I was 16. O ur art teacher tried to snatch a Stanley knife from my hand. I stood with my feet apart and locked each of my hands over either end of the blade . Ken Siddall was a tall, solid middle -aged man who regularly rowed. He used two hands and all his strength to try and jerk the knife from my grip. Terror washed over his face at realising not only could he not pull the knife from my hands, but my entire body was as still as a bronze statue. I did not move one single millimetre. The second incident occurred during parole officer training in Sydney. I somehow ended up on the mat sparing with the man who trained prison guards in dirty combat. He was a short, fit man with advanced belts in three martial arts. I supposedly had no such training . Yet I immediately had this combat expert in a head lock , slapping the mat, and forcing a muffled, ‘You got me!’ Sascha bore the pain of DELTA soldier training. I was six years old, dressed in a curly amber wig, strapped to a chair in front of two enormous television screens. My visual field was divided by a thin screen placed in front of my face, so my left eye could only see one giant screen, and my right eye could only view the other. Each screen was divided into six boxes. Each of the boxes played a different image. The six images in my left eye related to the six images in my right eye. But the images in my left eye were violent, while the ones in my right eye were peaceful. For example, one image in my right eye was a quiet garden, but the"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":" 387 corresponding screen in my left eye showed the same scene being bomb ed. Another image in my right eye showed a cute bunny , but the corresponding in my left eye showed the same bunny being slaughtered. And so forth. Metal sound rods were simultaneously placed in ear each and played completely different sounds. Sweet classical music entered one ear, while horrendous sounds of screaming and terror the other. This nightmare continued until I heard an audible ‘ Snap!’ echo through my head. Military Order of Dagon The Ancient Roman Legions worshipped their mascot god, as do our modern Western military forces. Dagon is the god worshipped by the Australian and US military elite, including Lt. Col. Michael A. Page 12 of Aquino’s 1 September 2018 CV boasts his membership in the ‘Esoteric Order of Dagon’: Dagon takes both reptilian and amphibian forms. The cavern system linking Holsworthy and Lucas Heights featured two main sacrificial areas dedicated to Dagon. A stone altar to reptilian Dagon is located beneath the Holsworthy end. Next to it stands a giant greenish metal statue of Dagon featuring scales and a dinosaur head and teeth. I attended rituals at this location with Gittinger, Kidman, Overton, DELTA soldiers, and senior military brass. The bottom floor of ANSTO accesses a tunnel leading to a large cave with a rectangular Dagon ritual pool. The pool is made of stone and lined with steps on all sides. It connects to, and is fed by, a natural water source. At one end of the murky green pool sits a stone carving of a fish monster with fin fingers and sharp teeth. I was hoisted over this pool at age six years and dunked repeatedly until I nearly drowned. Patricia Anne Conlon supervised this and determined, ‘She’s had enough.’"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":" 388 "},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":" 389 I suffered another Dagon drowning ritual at 12 years of age, in the cavern system beneath Holsworthy.

My next memory is of flashing lights and something long and choking being inserted in my throat. My next memory is of waki ng in the ANSTO hospital bed with Anne Conlon sitting to my left, looking concerned . The point of this exercise was to train me to hold my breath and swim underwater. Drowning taught me to know my physical limits and recognise how far I could push my body before I drowned. It was also a ritual intended to evoke the ‘spirit of Dagon.’ Dagon at Dulce I experienced another Dagon training incident in the USA when I was 14 years old. I was chained to a weight and thrown overboard into the sea. I was supposed to use my Dagon training to hold my breath, and my newly acquired psychic abilities to break free. I next recall collapsing on deck with medical personnel and the Commander leaning over me. ‘Did I do it?’ I asked the Commander. The other soldiers looked away in anger and disgust . ‘You did good, soldier ,’ the Commander muttered regretfully . ‘This is shit , man!’ one of the sailors complained. Dagon Hypnosis Induction This memory relates to my Dagon hypnosis induction which I adapted from the Aqua Man television show. Dagon is Aqua Man. The induction began with my diving off the navy"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":" 390 boat. I then swam like Aqua Man to a submarine. I entered the submarine through a domed top, passed through a door, down a spiral metal staircase, through another door, down a straight staircase, and through another door which brought me to the doctor surgery waiting room with the elevator and five doors. This was the induction Aquino, Gittinger, Kidman, West, Petrauskas, and Anne Co nlon used. Mengele created a deeper level of induction based on the same theme. His variation involved my diving from the US naval boat, bypassing the submarine, and entering an underwater stream. I spirall ed down the stream to reach a large underwater citadel located on the ocean floor. I swam beneath a rocky craic and surfaced in a Dagon pool. I emerged from the pool via a wide set of stairs, passed through a castle door and entered Dagon’s golden throne room. Two doors sat either side of the throne, red on the left and blue on the right. I opened the blue door and saw shadowy mermaids like tadpoles, swimming overhead. I walked through a glass aquarium tunnel to a door at the far end. Behind this door was a tall room with walls containing countless arched insets. Each inset housed a costumed mannequin which resembled a program or skill set. I stepped backwards into one of the costumes and suddenly recognised a style of martial arts where everything flowed in circles. When I first opened the red door during therapy , a tsunami of blood gushed into the throne room. Behind this door lay a stone hallway lined with iron cages full of children. At the end of the hall was another door, and behind that was Mengele’s lab in the US Embassy basement. A narrow window sat at the top of the wall to my right. Mengele sat in a chair below the window, behind a pale brown dentist chair . In the far-right corner behind Mengele was a blue door. Behind the door was a staircase with a metal rail which led to a stone tunnel. This basement laboratory was both real and used as a program setting, to confuse my memory . Mengele’s ‘Angel’ Mengele’s main alter was named ‘Angel. ’ It took three sessions to gain her cooperation and integrate her . I won Angel over by bowing before her on the floor and allowing her to behead me with her sword. ‘I’m still going to talk to you!’ I promised her . ‘Nothing will stop me from talking to you. ’ Angel then granted me access to the memory of how she was created. Mengele covered my entire body with electrodes, including needle electrodes under my nails, a large metal electrode inserted into my vagina , and a dog collar electrode fastened around my neck so that whenever I cried out in pain, Mengele electrocuted my throat. Consequently, Angel was mute. Mengele electrocuted my entire body until I became limp and dissociated. He then created Angel by dressing me in an Asian outfit: white pants, a blue silk top, and a long straight black wig with a blunt fringe. DELTA Psychic Training Aquino’s psychic training occurred at Dulce, in a white room with an observation window . I sat strapped to a wooden electric chair. EEG electrodes were attached to my head and electrocution pads stuck to my back. Training consisted of being successful - or being electrocuted. Tap, tap, tap... ‘What did you see?’ my therapist asked."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":" 391 I saw a giant red swirl, which became a vortex, which morphed into thin red flags flapping in the breeze. Then I saw a close-up of a brown horse’s head. An Ancient Asian warrior clad in segmented armour sat atop the horse, surrounded by multiple poles and flags. Where have I seen this before? I asked myself. Shogun? Marco Polo? Is this China or Japan? It’s China . This is Looking -Glass. Tap, tap, tap... The mental images of the ancient scene appeared on a monitor for the doctors to view. * * * DELTA t raining progressed to my being lowered into a thick box made of grey metal that was filled with water. The lid was closed. I transferred to another dimension, a dark prison containing a frightening entity. I relayed whatever this thing told me, to the Dulce doctors. On another occasion, Gittinger and Aquino somehow identified from my memory the exact coordinates of the celestial garden I visited during my near-death experience when Gittinger flat-lined me at age 10 years. They had me revisit the same location which I found void of people . I was restrained in Aquino’s chair when a fat general approached me. He was grey - haired, with a bulbous nose and flushed skin. His green uniform and brass buttons pressed against the right side of my face. He unzipped his trousers and exposed himself. ‘Don’t touch the merchandise, ’ I warned him, but he forced it into my mouth. So, I bit down hard and grinded from side to side. He screamed for help - which came too late. He was rushed into theatre for surgery. Our unit joked about the incident over dinner in the mess hall. ‘Hey,’ I threw my hands in the air in feigned innocence, ‘they never told me I couldn’t bite his dick off.’ The boys laughed hard. I paid for my insubordination. I was awoken that night by a violent pack rape committed by my unit after which the boys snapped out of their trance , sighed, cried and apologised profusely for violating their beloved mascot. ‘It’s okay, ’ I reassured and held them, ‘ I’d rather you do it instead of those bastards.’ * * * Alice! I’ m shot . . . falling . . . ‘Alice!’ a soldier yells, ‘Alice!’ He emerges from a swirling sand cloud, dressed in desert camos, holding an unusual weapon in one hand. ‘Alice!’ He leans over my collapsed form.

Staff in white lab coats sat behind a glass observation widow , two stories above, bathed in green light."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":" 392 ‘Woah!’ the boys marvelled nearby, dressed in green t-shirts and trousers, scratching their heads, looking at their hands. I was weighed down in an electrified vest. I rose to my feet and went berserk at the ‘white coats’ behind the window. ‘YOU FUCKING AMATEURS! ’ I screamed hysterically. Next, I’ m at the widow, pounding the cracking glass. A unit of soldiers storm my right visual field, armed with a net and stun guns. They contain me like a wild animal and knock me out. When I come to, Aquino is placating me, ‘ Yes, they did the wrong thing.’ That was our training for the real event held in what looks like an aircraft hangar. We stand in front of a giant circular ring. Behind us is a three -sided enclosure , padded for a soft return landing. ‘Roll! Roll! Roll!’ I yell as we enter the swirling tunnel, unperturbed because I have experienced something similar . It’s the ‘Doctor Who time-tunnel’ I rode after suffocating in the grave when I was eight years old. * * * CERN End Game Someone asked me via social media, ‘ Do you have a sense of the End Game?’ Yes, I do. The CERN large hadron collider in Switzerland is not about finding the hicks boson. CERN is a massive stargate , built on Tesla technology. CERN is powered by a quantum computer - the same type of computer that runs Google and NASA. Quantum computers are an advanced form of clairvoyance. Quantum computers make computations inter - dimensionally. Scientists punch math and physics problems into the quantum computer which are then processed by inter -dimensional ‘entities’ , aka AI (Artificial Intelligence). Elon Musk (MIT 2014) said: ‘With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon. You know all those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water and he’s like... yeah he’ s sure he can control the demon... doesn’t work out.’ Gordie Rose ( D-Wave quantum computers and Kindred AI ) clarified: ‘The things that that we are summoning into the world now are not demons, not evil , but more like the Lovecraftian Great Old Ones. They are entities not necessarily going to be aligned with what we want.’ 455 CERN’s Director for Research and Scientific Computing , Sergio Bertolucci, said the hadron collider could open otherworldly doors to another dimension, allowing something to emerge from it. 456 Outside CERN headquarters sits an ancient statue to Shiva, the goddess of destruction. The Roman form of Shiva is Apollyon. CERN is partially situated in a French town named Saint-Genis -Pouilly. Pouilly is Latin for Appolliacum, aka Apollyon, aka Apollo. CERN is built on the site of a Roman temple to Apollo, and over a traditional gateway to the abyss. 457 Revelation 9 says: And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. And he opened the bottomless pit; and 455 Gordie Rose ( June 2017) . ‘Super -Intelligent Aliens are Coming to Earth .’ TechVancouver conference. 456 Lewis Page (2009).

And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. . . And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon. The Bible describes the end game in detail. Further information is found in books suppress ed by the Synagogue of Satan: Enoch, Jasher and Jubilees. Jesus shared a relevant parable: And when the King came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who was not wearing a wedding garment, and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you enter here without a wedding garment?’ The intruder was speechless. Then the King said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. This parable refers to a celestial marriage feast attended exclusively by guests dressed in appropriate attire, that is, who gained immortality and new bodies through belief in Jesus Christ. The improperly ‘dressed’ intruder tried to attain immortality another way, via transhumanism technology. I deduce he used Stargate technology (CERN) to pierce the veil that separates this time -space dimension from Heaven. Years ago, the television news reported that scientists had isolated the gene which turns off death. The Bible warns of accepting the ‘mark’ injected in our right hand or in forehead. The Greek meaning of the word ‘mark’ relates to the venomous bite of a serpent. The mark is the ultimate vaccination, a synthesis of animal and Nephilim (serpent, fallen angel, ‘alien’ ) DNA that will alter human DNA, turn off the death gene, and seal a hellish fate. Hence Revelation describes people who seek death but are unable to die . The current vaccinations contain human and animal products and have been used to condition society to accept the hive mind horro r to come. CERN is designed to pierce the veil that separates this time -space dimension from others, including Heaven and Hell. CERN is the Luciferian end game that pulls together all N azi and JASON technology. Dulce, Pine Gap and other underground facilities are preparing technology for Armageddon in which they plan to storm Heaven and battle Christ Himself. The Gateway Process provided a peek behind the celestial curtains, while CERN is designed to completely tear the veil and release the demonic hordes. A real-life Star Wars is coming, and everyone will be forced to pick a side. * * * "},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":" 394 Psychology 101 You can be a psychologist like a rock star and have fame and money -  and that's what I intend to do . - Martin Seligman, CIA psychologist The white uniformed figures shifted in and out of focus and they rushed about my limp form, sticking things onto my chest, and inserting things into my arms. ‘Do you wish you were dead now ?!’ someone yelled at me. ‘No.’ ‘Have you ever harmed yourself before?’ ‘No.’ Two weeks ago, I was a typical college student with no medical history when I suddenly began suffering vertigo and insomnia. I was walking sideways into walls and had not slept for a fortnight. My GP found no apparent cause for the vertigo, and he prescribed sleeping pills – which I took all at once. ‘What happened last night?’ a doctor asked me the following morning. My brother’s fiancé, who was also my best friend and roommate, arrived home late last night. I had taken a sleeping pill long before Rosalind awoke me, giggling about suddenly ending her engagement to my brother and marrying Glen instead. Glen?! I was confused. She’s ditching her Tom Cruise lookalike high school sw eetheart to marry some scumbag we just met at church?! I wondered what it was about his coke bottle glasses and 70’s porn star moustache that she found so attractive. Only weeks ago, this Glen had gushed, ‘ I don’t know who I love more, Fiona or Rosalind.’ Rosalind’s revelation proved too much after recent events. Two weeks prior , my step- grandfather was found hanged to death in his chicken coop . I did not feel my body as I floated to the kitchen, fetched the medicine bottle, unscrewed the lid, and downed its entire contents. I did not feel the pills touch my throat. I did not wonder whether it might be dangerous. All I remember thinking is, Now I’ll get to sleep . I was found unconscious the following morning. ‘Have you ever se en a psychiatrist before?’ a young psychiatric registrar asked. He would go on to fail his final psychiatric exam six times. I now wonder why he was rejected by the medical fraternity. Was he that talentless compared to the morons I encountered in the industry? Or perhaps his rejection was punishment for encouraging me to remember. ‘Yes, ’ I answered. ‘Who?’ ‘Ian Cole.’ ‘When was that?’ ‘I was sixteen.’ ‘Until when?’ ‘Until I left school at eighteen.’ ‘Who referred you to him?’"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":" 395 ‘No one. I was friends with his daughter, and we were talking on the phone . ‘Are you depressed again?’ Zoe had asked. I was 16. Wasn’t everyone depressed at 16? I had always suffered a kind of existential depression which exacerbated as my home life deteriorated. What’s the meaning of life? I clearly recall despairing at age five years. What is the difference between dying when you are 80 and dying at eight, when you are going to die anyhow? ‘Here’s Dad!’ Zoe passed the call to Dr Ian Cole. That is how I ended up in psychotherapy two school lunchtimes per week without my parents’ knowledge or a doctor’s referral. It was an unconventional therapeutic relationship in other ways. Sometimes I attended the mega parties Ian Cole hosted at his Upper Burringbar property, where the smoke of incense and marijuana entwined as adults and minors lounged on Japanese inspired décor, sharing bongs. The revels were an extension of the ‘60s counterculture, whe re budding artist Ian Cole partied with Sydney’s avant-garde scene in which parents got drunk and high, leaving a generation of kids to be preyed on by the likes of Dave. Dave climbed into a bed at Ian Cole’s house where Zoe’s 14 -year-old friend Sharon lay asleep. Sharon awoke to Dave sexually assaulting her. Ian put Sharon’s subsequent trauma response down to a lack of ‘open-mindedness.’ ‘Open-minded’ is how Zoe described her model boyfriend Craig’s attitude toward being drugged and raped at a gathering of teachers including his uncle, the principal who covered up the Education Department pedophile ring I eventually exposed. The morning after the party, Craig awoke in the bed of our gay Murwillumbah high school Careers teacher with no memory of how he got there. Terry Cleal stood naked in the bedroom doorway, mincing at Craig, ‘It’s okay, sweetie.’ Zoe had sex with Craig when she was 13 years old. Ian Cole’s reaction to this was warning her daughter , ‘Hey, don’t get pregnant.’ Ian’s youngest daughter Jessie had sex with her boyfriend Gabe very young also. The Cole’s were a living example of Margaret Mead’s sexual revolution. Ian divorced Zoe’s mother Kerry when Zoe was three, after he was caught screwing a nurse named Jan at the psychiatric hospital he worked at. His high school sweetheart, Kerry, attempted suicide after discovering the reason for Ian’s regular overnight stays at work. Ian Cole discarded his family like a fast food container and started a new one with the nurse . Zoe felt displaced by this, especially after her mother remarried and had a son to a domestic violence perpetrator. Suddenly Zoe and her older sister Billie belonged to no family. People dismiss the impact of divorce on the displaced children of the first marriage and its contribution to youth suicide. ‘I love all my children equally!’ Ian protested following Zoe’s death. Zoe felt differently . Zoe moved in with Ian’s new family at the start of high school. Her arrival shoved a bomb beneath Ian’s slice of hippie paradise. I was the only one who realised thi s was no Brady Bunch moment. I was the only one who detected the mental pain Zoe was in. I was the only person Zoe warned that she was contemplating suicide. Zoe’s older sister, Billie , joined Ian’s family a few years later and graduated from my high school . Billie presented as a cold character who preferred the Japanese culture she eventually adopted. I never understood Billie until I had a daughter just like her . Zoe felt"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":" 396 inferior to Billie who was voted school captain, dux of her grade, came second in the state for Japanese translation, and won the regional debating final. Zoe’s lousy high school certificate marks seemed to be the final straw. She left for Germany where she lamented to her friend Emma, ‘I can never go home until I’m famous.’ I know because I visited Emma in Hamburg after Zoe ’s death. Zoe was living in Sydney when I received her final letter. It contained one standout sentence scrawled in alien handwriting: ‘Sometimes I feel like committing suicide ...’ I tried to show the letter to its intended reader - her father - but he rejected my concern s. ‘No, no!’ Ian threw his hands up in protest, ‘What goes on between you and Zoe is your business.’ He refused to read the letter. Zoe’s subsequent suicide in Amsterdam instigated a wave of mourning that extended from Murwillumbah to Byron Bay. How could someone so pretty, talented, popular and strong kill herself, they wondered. Everyone was shocked - except me. ‘There were no signs!’ her father exclaimed. Yes, there were. Zoe had been dropping hints for years. She began cut ting her wrist while living in Sydney with Ian’s friends. ‘She’s just attention-seeking, ’ the psychiatrist couple concluded . I met Zoe’s mother in a Sydney restaurant. ‘Billie had warned me about meeting up with you,’ Kerry confessed halfway through lunch. ‘Really. What did she say?’ ‘She said you were very intense.’ ‘Well ,’ I sighed indignantly , ‘suicide is pretty intense.’ ‘Suicide is a one -way street. When I saw Zoe, she was lying on a metal table . She looked like a frozen lump of meat. The only thing that seemed natural was her hair, so I stroked that. That wasn’t Zoe lying there. Zoe was somewhere else -...’ As Kerry spoke, my brain turned her description of my dead friend into a movie which was stored in long-term memory as if I had been standing in that morgue . The mental image never faded but functioned as a suicide deterrent. ‘You know,’ she continued ‘it’s amazing. I had a guy, sitting exactly where you are, last week try and convince me that I should use cocaine.’ I eyeballed Kerry and asserted, ‘Don’t listen to him. He was lying. Cocaine won’t fix this.’ Cocaine was the recreational drug of the moment, hailed for being non-addictive. I knew otherwise. Kerry continued, ‘I couldn’t get an autopsy done on Zoe because they don’t do that on suicides in Holland. But I suspect Zoe was pregnant to some guy called Dave. She kept going on and on about some guy called Dave. Who the fuck is Dave?’ My gut dropped. ‘Ian has a friend called Dave. It’s not him, is it? He’s old enough to be Zoe’s father .’ Kerry showed me a picture of Zoe in Greece - with Dave. ‘That’s him! Ugh! He’s a Vietnam Veteran. He was a patient of Ian’s. He doesn’t work. He hangs around Ian a lot. He’s on some huge veteran pension. He convinced the government psychiatrist to grant him the highest pension rate by picking up the psychiatrist’s desk and"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":" 397 throwing it through the window. I met him at Ian’s parties. My friend spied him talking to Billie in town, constantly perving down her top. He’s a sleaze.’ Dave was present during my final visit to Ian Cole’s Upper Burringbar home. I sat at the kitchen table until midnight, watching the men get drunk and reminisc e about Zoe. Toward the end of my visit, Ian confessed he had recently battled the compulsion to chop his family up with a carving knife. ‘I had to throw the knife up the back paddock, ’ he explained. Then he smiled knowingly at me, ‘ Do you want to see Zoe?!’ ‘Okay,’ I shrugged, wondering what was about to happen. Minutes later, my former psychiatrist returned with a wooden urn containing Zoe’s ashes. He fetched a dessert spoon from the kitchen draw, opened the urn lid, scooped out a spoonful of Zoe’s ashes – and ate them. ‘The intent being, ’ Dave commentated, ‘to return Zoe from whence she came.’ Ian abruptly closed the urn, gathered it under his arm, and rushed outside. I followed behind and watched him unceremoniously scatter my friend’s ashes amongst the ginger plants next to the kitchen widow . ‘I’m sane !’ I yelled at God on my drive home that night. ‘ I’m sane! That was insane!’ I appealed to my current psychiatrist for help with Ian Cole’s madness. Yet again, my concerns went unheeded. I was not surprised when Ian Cole committed suicide at his Upper Burringbar property two years later. Ian died of guilt. He paid a hefty price for ‘free sex.’ A former close friend of Zoe’s contacted me after reading the above story on my blog site. She and Zoe were best friends at an ACT primary school but lost contact after age 10. The friend unexpectedly encountered Zoe four years later at a Murwillumbah eisteddfod. Zoe did not greet her former best friend as expected. Instead, Zoe blurted something about being made to perform oral sex on an adult male - and walked off. Some found my account of Ian eating Zoe’s ashes far-fetched. Jesse Cole, the daughter Ian had with the nurse, subsequently published her memoir describing her father’s decent into insanity following Zoe’s suicide , including the time he was arrested for breaking into a stranger’s house, smearing himself in excrement and writing all over the walls. * * * Useless Physicians I have dealt with hundreds of counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists as both a recipient and provider of mental health services. I have spoken to countless victims of ritual abuse and mind control. I have liaised with and advised therapists who work with victims. I experienced the criminal workings of the organisations that regulate and control the Australian mental health industry , and I have met other victims of these governing bodies. Based upon this wealth of experience, I must conclude that the Australian mental health industry is a putrid mess of dysfunction and corruption. The experts in charge of the mental health industry responsible for determining who can practise what, are proven perpetrators. The therapists under their auspices are mostly complicit, lazy, incompetent, or nuts. Most therapists present to patients as condesc ending, unskilled, unempathetic, unethical, fearful, and generally useless. Most therapists are angry control freaks, of average intelligence, criminally insane, or sexual perverts. Most therapists"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":" 398 lack the ethics, professionalism, and skill needed to support a client in general, never mind a victim of the most extreme abuse. Suitable therapists are rare. It took me 35 years to locate a clean, trauma-focussed, EMDR-trained, genuine Christian psychiatrist with expertise in treating ritual abuse and mind control. I will now discuss the main reasons why victims of ritual abuse and mind control typically find it impossible to locate a suitable therapist who uses effective trauma and dissociation treatment methods. Australian therapists lack the ethics, knowledg e and skills to effectively treat victims of extreme abuse , due to the following factors: 1. Australian universities have long been infiltrated by perpetrators of pedophilia and MK-ULTRA (as I demonstrated with Bond University); 2. Psychology theory and practise are based on MK -ULTRA experimentation; 3. Treatment interventions were designed to perpetuate and maintain trauma and dissociation; and 4. The CIA introduced denial theories which under pin all teaching, training, clinical and forensic practise in Australia. Mind Control Roots of Psychology The pioneers of psychology and psychiatry engaged in practises that were dubious, abhorrent, or just plain weird. Carl Jung based his writings on Alchemy and the ancient mystery cults, particularly Mithraism, and founded his own religious cult, the tenets of which are found in the New Age movement and the modern Kundalini-spirit -filled charismatic churches. 458 Sigmund Freud intentionally hid his clinical finding that his patients’ ‘hysteria’ stemmed from dissociated memories of child sexual abuse: The event of which the subject has reta ined an unconscious memory is an unusually early experience of sexual relations with actual excitement of the genitals, resulting from sexual abuse committed by another person; and the period of life at which this fatal event takes place is earliest youth – the years up to the age of eight or 10, before the child has reached sexual maturity. A passive sexual experience before puberty: this then is the specific cause of hysteria... In some 18 cases of hysteria I have been able to discover this connection in ev ery single case and, where the circumstances allowed, to confirm it by therapeutic success. 459 Freud replaced his finding with the Oedipus Complex theory that children fantasise about have sex with their parents. Thanks to Freud, VIP pedophiles like his own grandson dismiss child abuse memories as ‘false memories’ and child abuse victims as ‘fantasists.’ All modern psychology is mind control.

Carl Rogers, father of humanistic psychology, documented his CIA recruitment in a 1956 memo to the University of Chicago’s chancellor: Dr Harold Wolff of Cornell Medical School is one of the world’s leading authorities in psychosomatic medicine... A week ago, he asked me if I would serve with him as a consultant to the Department of Defence on a top-secret matter having to do with mental health. He said, ‘I am asking the five top-ranking men in the country in this field to serve on this task. You are one of the five, and I hope you will serve. Harold Wolff was a world -famous neurologist appointed by the CIA Director to investigate Soviet brainwashing methods. He and fellow researcher Hinkie were the first to identify that the ‘Soviet technique rested on the cumulative weight of intense psycholog ical pressure and human weakness.’ 461 Carl Rogers built on Ivan Pavlov’s research in which the Soviet paired a bell with electrocution to trigger fear in dogs at the sound of the bell. In 1959, the Human Ecology Fund financed Rogers to conduct MK -ULTRA research which examined the ‘Correlation of Psychological and Physiological Variables in Personality and Personality Change.’ Roger’s study involved attaching electrodes to patients to ‘ascertain their inner state of mind’ and contributed to MK -ULTRA Subproject 97 which examined: Process of personality change during psychotherapy.

Skinner , known as the father of operant conditioning, studied human responses to environmental cues. Two corollaries of his operant conditioning were aversion therapy and desensitization. Aversion therapy uses traumatic reinforcement like electric shock to reduce an unwanted behaviour. Skinner was a consultant to Ole Ivar Lovaas, who was hired by Major Louis Jolyon West to conduct MK -ULTRA experiments at UCLA. Documented in mainstream newspapers and magazines, including Psychology Today, 462 these experiments involved behavioural conditioning of autistic children using cattle prods, physical violence, and electrocution via a metal floor. 460 Hank P .

Even gross differences in anatomical structure limits are far less than you may think...

A woman involved in a conference held in Anaheim in the early 1980s, told me the group hired out Disneyland for two nights. Their rationale for spending two evenings at the MK-ULTRA facility was to ‘get in touch with their inner child.’ Freud, Jung, Skinner, Rogers, Watson, May, Beck, Ellis – the ir opinions and research underpin all psychology training. Nazi ‘Therapies’ The Nazis murder ed at least 300,000 psychiatric patients. Paperclip resettled an estimated 5,000 Nazis, including prominent psychiatrists and behaviour modification experts, in the USA post WWII, with others immigrating later. 463 At least 137 Nazi scientists are known to have been resettled in Australia under Matchbox . These Nazis trained the MK -ULTRA perpetrators who fathered modern psychiatry and psychology and influenced the post -WWII transition from Freud’s philosophical approach to physical interventions: anticonvulsants, antidepressants, deep-sleep therapy, drug abreaction sessions, electroshock, endocrine supplements, insulin shock, lobotomy, narco-hypnosis, and stimulants. These ‘therapeutic’ interventions are intended to induce and maintain trauma and dissociation and prevent integration. Treatment methods are inappropriate and ineffective if they: - Were used to cause the victim’s trauma and dissociation in the first place . - Perpetuate and maintain trauma and dissociation. - Do not connect with the right hemisphere and implicit memory . - Deny the existence and nature of the abuse . - Do not retrieve and fully process the trauma memories. Denial-Based Techniques Psychotherapy is based on Freud’s denial of child abuse peppered with Jung’s occultism. Talk therapy on its own is useless, because talking is a left-brain activity . Trauma memories are stored in the right hemisphere’s implicit memory system and can’t be accessed by verbal interactions based on left-brain cognitive or logical processes. Hence a victim can work hard at therapy for 20 years but make zero progress. Behaviour Therapies include Positive Psychology, CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), ACT (Acceptance Commitment Therapy), DBT (Dialectic Behavioural Therapy), and Schema-Focussed Therapy. Behaviour therapies are ineffective and cruel because behaviour is a symptom of the underlying problem, not the problem itself. Based on CIA-funded torture 463 Lenny Lapon (1986).

Behavioural therapies contain a two-prong attack on recovering repressed memories: 1. Passivity : The basic premise of these techniques is for victims to loosely acknowledge they were abused but do nothing to explore the abuse experiences trapped in implicit memory. My Counselling Psychology lecturer taught us to, ‘Just let the memories sit there. Let them be.’ In other words, surrender, remain in the passive state of acceptance and learned helplessness that Seligman pioneered, because there is nothing we can do. 2. False Action : These therapies simultaneously misdirect victims’ energies toward identifying and changing specific thoughts and behaviours. For example, thought loops implicitly created via conditioning are combated by thinking of a red Stop sign at every intrusive thoug ht. Happiness is the therapeutic goal, and positive thinking and mental distraction are the key s to success. Positive thinking excludes focussing on negative topics like witnessing kids being butchered. Instead, if you force a smile, your brain will be tricked into following and you will eventually genuinely feel happier. Willpower is no match for sophisticated brainwashing techniques. It is like defending yourself against a warship with a popgun. These methods impose a mental discipline which the victim can’t satisfy. When they surely fail, victims are blamed for exerting insufficient willpower. Positive Psychology correlates with Positive Illusion - inaccuracy regarding reality . Antony Kidman, who introduced CBT to Australia, explained the application of CBT ‘for people suffering from psychosis’ in a 2014 ABC Radio interview: 464 NORMAN SWAN: So, what do you do? Do you confront somebody, say, if you're starting to believe that the world is against you and people are talking about you ?... ANTONY KIDMAN: Well, we do, but of course we don't challenge necessarily the fact that they say, ' People are trying to kill me ,’ or ' There's people from the CIA or ASIO across the road in a car sending me messages'. The therapeutic approach is to say, well, 'What does that really mean ?’ or ‘Just elaborate on how you feel about that?’ without saying ' That's a load of nonsense !' - but not accepting it either. Here is my retort to that interview. How should we ‘ feel ’ about the following: - Kidman died four months after giving the above radio interview, as a direct consequence of my reporting his CIA abuse of me to the NSW Health Board. - The NSW health board pre viously received similar complaints concerning Kidman. - I have since heard from multiple Antony Kidman mind control victims or their therapists. 464 ABC Radio National, Health Report, Cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis , 5 May 2014."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":" 402 - I took photos of the head ASIO who stalked me at Marrickville , posted one on social media , and submitted a full body closeup shot to the police who took statements from the two credible witnesses to the incident, plus from two of the ASIO agents who panicked at being exposed. Kidman’s notion of focussing on the victim’s feelings and what their memories mean for them - while denying the truth of the CIA-ASIO child trafficking victim ’s experiences - is the same denial approach contained in APS Guidelines on Repressed Memories (written by MK-ULTRA psychologists): • Psychologists should seek to meet the needs of clients who report memories of abuse and should do this quite apart from the truth or falsity of those reports. • Psychologists should explore with the client the meaning and implications of the memory for the client, rather than focus solely on the content of the reported memory. Dissociative -Based Therapy Techniques The following therapies stem from the mystery religions and incorporate methods which CIA perpetrators use to dissociate victims. Visualisation activates the right hemisphere and is used to facilitate astral travel and interdimensional access. Chanting ( Om ) creates a resonance which causes the brain hemispheres to synchronise their frequencies with the frequency exerted by our physical surroundings. It is used to facilitate interdimensional access. Transcendental Meditation is a dissociative tool used by Asian cultures (Yogis, Tibetan monks, Ninjas, Shaolin Masters) and to tap into an esoteric power source, mute physical pain, lower heart rate and breathing for survival purposes, and summon Chi (electromagnetic energy) to increase physical strength, harness and weaponize psychic ability, levitate physically, move objects using the mind, and access other dimensions. MK-ULTRA victims were abused using the same esoteric practises. Yoga in the 1970s consisted of healthy exercises that stimulated the vagus nerve , internally massaged the body, and exercised the eyes and improved visual processing. Modern yoga practises focus on mediation, chanting Om , awakening the chakras, and evoking Kundalini. Mindfulness is both a denial and dissociative approach stemming from Taoist and Buddhist religions. Mindfulness incorporates dissociative techniques: transcendental meditation, visualisation, and astral projection. These practices repeat the victim’s abuse experiences, promote dissociation, reinforce programming, and inhibit integration. The basic premise of Mindfulness is to live more in the moment and spend less time contemplating past stressors or worrying about future problems. Mindfulness encourages victims to change their perception of reality or themselves, which makes it another denial therapy. Mindfulness- based cognitive therapy (MBCT) combines mindfulness with CBT, thereby delivering a double"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":" 403 dose of denial. Not surprisingly, UK and USA studies found meditation and mindfulness trigger panic, confusion, mania, depression, psychosis, and hallucinations. 465 466 Psychedelic Drugs In Psychopharmacology , o ur lecturer taught us that LSD was a real subject, scientifically studied at Ivy league universities, and that researchers believed psychedelics open the veil that separates this dimension from other dimensions. The MK -ULTRA perpetrators I studied, used LSD to create the initial brain splits in MK -ULTRA victims, and for layering in subsequent programming. LSD and other hallucinogens return victims to the state of consciousness they were in when being tortured and programmed; they trigger and flood victims with trauma memories, preventing them from grounding, and placing them at risk of getting stuck in a flashback . Drugs also open victims up to spiritual problems. Any doctor who suggests using LSD as a treatment method for traumatised and dissociative clients is either dumb - or dirty. Somatic Therapy is a grey area. It combines psychotherapy with physical activities, some of which are fine. When somatic activities involve meditation, yoga and theatre , that is unsuitable. Theatre (or acting) techniques employ shamanic practises of centring, meditation, visualisation, dissociation and channelling. Like John bell and Frater 6161 said, theatre is ritual. Theatre, like ritual, summons entities into this dimension. As in ritual, actors invoke entities to possess them, so they can perform. Brain Splitting Methods Lobotomy, electrocution, and psychiatric drugs all disengage the frontal lobes by physically severing this area from the rest of the brain. ECT damages the dorsolateral prefrontal cortical region , the same area targeted in surgical lobotomy. ECT electrodes are placed over the frontal lobes and the most intensive electrical surge fries the memory centres in the tip of the temporal lobes. That is why CIA perpetrators used lobotomy, electrocution and psychiatric drugs to split the brain and repress memories. Electrocution . Victims are subjected to copious amounts of electrocution in the form of cattle prodding, crash cart paddles, giant electrodes, electric chairs, and ECT. In adulthood, I had flashbacks of being electrocuted in different brain areas, depending on which ones they wanted to separate from the rest of the brain. They also precisely administered electrocution to specific brain regions via a needle inserted into my scalp. John C. Lilly pioneered the method for insert ing electrodes into the brain to stimulate exact centr es of anger, anxiety, fear, pain and pleasure . Lilly mapped the entire brain for this purpose. As a result of electrocution, victims may suffer a lifetime of symptoms including heart attacks, strokes, nervous system damage, and memory loss. These conditions may occur in a victim’s youth or degenerate with age. I suffered a heart attack at age 37, a stroke at 39, and 465 Miguel Farias & Catherine Wikholm (2015), The Buddha Pill: can meditation change you? Watkins Publishing . 466 Lazarus, A. (1976).

ECT has zero therapeutic benefits for victims. Doctors claim ECT temporarily reduces anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation, when these feelings are in fact symptoms that typically precede a trauma memory as it edges toward conscious recall. ECT stops the trauma memories surfacing. Like drugs, ECT is used to silence patients and so make the psychiatric staff feel more comfortable. The anaesthetic does not reduce the trauma felt during ECT. It simply buries the pain back beneath an amnesia wall. The anaesthetic increases the brain damage ECT causes. Hospitals all over Australia still illegally administer excessive bouts of ECT without patient consent, including my local Tweed Heads District Hospital. A movement to outlaw ECT is backed by sound research has been blocked by pedophiles in power. Drugs . During my 30 -year recovery attempt, I was rarely prescribed drugs. The longest I ever took medication for was for three to six weeks. I hav e a hypersensitive nervous system which, I suspect, stems in part from the amount and variety of drugs that my perpetrators pumped into my system from a very young age. My sensitivity precludes me from taking most drugs, and I can only handle small doses. A retired pharmacist gave me some advice: ‘Never take the newer drugs. You’d be lucky if a new drug has been tested on 10,000 subjects, making you a human guinea pig. Stick to the old and tried drugs.’ For example, the drug Cymbalta is making abuse victims suicidal, and withdrawal from it induces such bad side effects (such as heart problems) that people can’t withdraw from it. Some of the newer antidepressants have reportedly caused hallucinogenic type reactions. Valium can be effective for immediate relief from fresh trauma and flashbacks but is too addictive for long-term usage. The older style beta-blockers ( like Inderal) are seemingly effective for PTSD. For example, processing memories can trigger an adverse heart response. Beta-blockers may provide relief from the heart’s constant reaction to the stress of reliving traumatic memories during therapy and providing witness testimony to police and courts. While certain research studies suggest the beta-blockers are effective for trauma memory restructuring, I wonder whether their mechanism of action interferes with brain integration. One psychiatrist prescribed me an asthma medication to take when I anticipate being triggered or have just been triggered. This is effective for about two days, after which its effects reverse to cause anxiety and asthma. Neurofeedback Soviet neuroscientist Yuri Kropotov (who discovered the function of the basal ganglia) visited the Tweed Shire in 2015. During this he publicly stated, ‘Psychiatry has failed’ and that neurofeedback is the modern means of combating mental health disorders – that plus the lobotomies his Pavlovian brain institute regularly perform in St Petersberg . I participated in Kropotov’s neurofeedback study in which data taken from thousands of Australian trauma victims was sent to the Pavlovian institute in Russia. The neurofeedback training programs used in the study, also designed by Russians, featured triggers including Egyptian occult symbols and walls of dripping blood."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":" 405 My Russian relative threw a fit when I joined the study. ‘You’ve been Total Recalled! ’ she screamed at me. ‘They’re reprogramming you!

And now your entire brain has been downloaded and sent to the Russian equivalent of the CIA! Whatever happened to sovereign borders?! They’re sending sensitive information about how Australians respond to trauma - to Russia ! They’re committing treason! ’ Indeed, the alpha-theta biofeedback training induced a hypnotic trance state during which I was subliminally influenced. Immediately afterwards, I made an atypical, unprecedented misjudgement while driving, whic h caused a serious wreck and exacerbated my pre -existing head injury. I believe this was an attempted hit, because I almost suffered a similar accident one week prior. When I confronted my therapist over the neurofeedback - induced car crash, her work with the Russians, her relationship with local cult members, and her pedophile father, she became enraged, personally attacked and blamed me, and terminated therapy. Hypnosis On 21 November 2011, UK Channel 4 aired a program called Derren Brown – The Assassin featur ing celebrity Stephen Fry . Hypnotist Derren Brown demonstrated that a person can be influenced under hypnosis to do that which they normally would not then forget the behaviour afterwards. Brown successfully hypnotised a person, programmed him to fire a gun more accurately under hypnosis, instructed him to shoot Stephen Fry upon spying a visual trigger, and to completely forget the incident afterwards. Beware of hypnosis, particularly if you are at the start of your healing journey, or if you completely dissociate and lose all memory during therapy. A dirty doctor could do anything to you during hypnosis and you would not recall it. Because unethical hypnosis was used to abuse victims, the mere employment of hypnotherapy is triggering. Further, the victim was hypnotically programmed with hundreds of access codes, so unless the therapist knows those codes, or how to avoid their effects, they could trigger a programmed instruction for the victim to attack the therapist or themselves. Neuro -Linguistic Programming (NLP) NLP is a way of ‘re-patterning’ the human brain to turn us into super -beings – confident, non-phobic, thin super -beings who can sell coals to Newcastle and know what people are thinking just by their eye movements. It is the theory that we are computers and can be reprogrammed as easily as computers can. You were abused as a child? That makes you a badly programmed computer who needs a spot of instant reprogramming. Forget therapy: just turn off the bit of the brain that remembers the abuse... I first heard of Bandler in 2002, when a former US special forces soldier told me he’d watched him, two decades earlier, bring a tiny girl into special forces and reprogram her in seconds to be a world-class sniper ... "},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":" 406 If you hear voices in your head, [Bandler] says, te ll the voices to shut the fuck up. ‘If you suffered childhood abuse, don't go back and relive it in your mind. Once is enough! ’ He says psychotherapy is nonsense and a racket: therapists are rewarded for failure. The longer a problem lasts, the more the th erapist is paid. Who cares about the roots of the trauma? ‘Don't think about bad things! ’ Bandler says. ‘There's a machine inside your brain that gets rid of shit that doesn't need to be there. Use it! I can give myself amnesia. I can just forget.’ He clicks his fingers. ‘Just like that.’ 467 NLP is a subtle form of hypnosis that subconsciously influenc es victim behaviour . NLP is primarily based on the work of MK -UKTRA hypnotherapist Milton Erickson and psychotherapist Fritz Perls. It was founded in the 1970s by Capt. John Grinder (US Special Forces and Intelligence ) and student Richard Bandler at the University of California in Santa Cruz under the supervis ion of MK-ULTRA anthropologist and linguist Gregory Bateson. In November 1986, Bandler stood trial for the shooting of prostitute Corine Christensen after he left the scene of her murder . Despite ove rwhelming forensic evidence that he shot Corine, Bandler used NLP techniques to sway the jury who later cried in regret for letting a killer escape . NLP is aimed at activating the right hemisphere’s implicit visual and emotional systems and deactivating left brain logic. NLP is used by cult and trafficking network members to gain a victim’s trust, with the goal of manipulating or framing the target. NLP perpetrators employs the following tactics: - Glean Information: Observe target’s visual and auditory clues (eye movement , pupil dilation, winks ) to determine the target’s brain hemispheric processing preference , method of brain processing and memory storage, p referred sensory system arousal , and honesty. For instance, looking up indicates visual memory retrieval. - Establish Rapport: Mirror victim’s body language and speech to make them drop their guard and become suggestible . - Use language that encourages visual imagery, to activate the right brain hemisphere which unquestioningly accepts suggestion. (‘ Can you see...’ or ‘ Look at...’ ) - Elicit emotion in the target’s right hemisphere by leading, language, and having the target visualise the perpetrators desired result. - Anchor a suggestion in the target’s mind by using physical cues (e.g., touching the target’s shoulder). - Use vague language to induce a hypnotic trance . - Use permissive language . (‘ Feel free to...’ ) - Use gibberish to confuse the target and make them accept a lucid suggestion. CIA Victim Denial Approaches Anthony ‘Tony’ Robbins popularised NLP which, he claims, has helped ‘people with multiple personalities.’ 468 This is concerning since investigative journalists recently exposed 467 Jon Ronson (2006). Don’t Worry, Get Therapy. The Guardian , 20 May. 468 Tony Robbins (1991) . Awakening the Giant Within , Simon & Schuster , 22."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":" 407 Tony Robbins’ sexual misconduct and his abuse of vulnerable victims. At his conferences, Robbins employs mind control techniques including sleep deprivation, and he publicly berates victims of physical and sexual abuse who disclose in front of large crowds. Robbins said of a rape victim, ‘She’s fucking using all this stuff to try and control men.’ Robbins negated the existence of abuse by attacking the notion of being a victim. He stated at a 2018 conference, ‘...victimhood is now rewarded in our culture. . . it’s now leve rage. Someone can now come and make claims about anybody...’ Tony Robbins uses denial to blame victims for reacting normally to their trauma. Denial of sex abuse is a perpetrator trademark. Not buying into the ‘victimization narrative ’ was a dialogue feature of NLP practitioner Keith Raniere whose NXIVM cofounder was personally trained in NLP by Bandler. In his Twelve -point Mission Statement for the NXIVM sex trafficking operation, Raniere wrote: ‘There are no ultimate victims; Therefore, I will not choose to be a victim.’ Child abuse denial is the CIA’s trademark. Useless Physicians Therapists who possess no relevant knowledge, skills or experience with ritual abuse and mind control, are at a treatment loss when victims like me enter their practise . Few therapists are willing to adjust their usual practise protocol to research an entir ely new area of expertise just to accommodate one client’s unorthodox treatment needs. They are busy, and their time costs. Ethical practitioners who do possess the capacity to work with victims of organised trafficking undoubtedly come under perpetrator surveillance. That is how child trafficking remains secret. Those who help victims typically find themselves professionally and personally threatened. If the therapist works under the umbrella of an organisation, that organisation tends to stop the therapist’s efforts. If the therapist runs their own business, that business is usually targeted until the therapist is forced to choose between their livelihood and loyalty to the client. Therapists are paid to care. No psychologist ever told me their initial reason for entering the industry was to help others. The majority were attracted due to their own unresolved personal issues. A portion were lured to the earning potential of a psychologist, or the travel opportunities it affords. I studied with a student whose goal was to work in New York and enjoy shopping on 5th Avenue. Some a re motivated by their passion for research and a desire for social recognition. Many demonstrate unmanaged autism, which would explain why clients are treated robotically and without empathy. An alarming number of therapists seek sexual access to the vulnerable. A student I studied with said when she worked as an administrator for the NSW Psychology registration board in the 1980s, the main complaint she received everyday conce rned psychologists taking sexual advantage of their clients. She added that she was raped by a University of Sydney psychology lecturer. Psychiatrists and psychologists are trained to listen, feign empathy, and say little during sessions. Clients mistake this silence for intelligence or understanding. Like the proverb says, ‘Even a fool seems wise if he shuts his mouth.’ Therapists follow a clinical script which they began learning from day one of their training. At university, we were made to prepare"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":" 408 and memorise such scripts. Our Counselling Psychology lecturer said empathy can be scripted, learnt, faked until achieved. That approach does not work with victims of ritual abuse and mind control, because their visual-spatial processing capacity enables them to read micro facial expressions and detect feigned empathy. Victims dismiss fake therapists as untrustworthy and plain stupid. Many clients do not know the difference between psychiatrists and psychologists. Psychologists have a more varied repertoire of therapy interventions compared to doctors. At a minimum, psychologists have studied four years of psychology theory followed by two years of supervised clinical training acquired either through a university master program, or under the supervision of a community practitioner. Master program training is standardised and thus superior. But do not be impressed by a PhD, as this only demonstrates someone can complete a PhD. Most academics are arrogant, left-brain dominant, and cognitively inflexible. Psychiatrists study medicine and are essentially drug pushers who attribute most mental health conditions to a biochemical imbalance. Most psychological issues stem from childhood trauma. P sychiatric facilities would quickly empty if doctors adopted a trauma - focused treatment approach. Psychiatrists religiously consult their diagnostic bible, the DSM ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders ), a scientifically invalid collection of opinions. Basically, a group of men on the CIA payroll met and reached a consensus regarding what constitutes mental illness. The DSM has been used to silence victims ever since. Most mental health patients are typically forced into one or more DSM categories. My university psychology class were pressur ed to squeeze clients into at least one DSM category. If we did not do this, the case reports in our clinical folios had to be edited and resubmitted until we complied Medical schools instil an inflated sense of self-importance. The University of NSW repeatedly told their medical students, ‘You are the chosen ones.’ How amusing, considering the average IQ of a medical doctor is 120 and the exceptionality they refer to starts at least two standard deviations above that. Egotistic therapists can’t work with victims of ritual abuse and mind control. In fact, they make the worst therapists in general. Pride and ego will always interfere with the therapist’s objectivity and motivation. Unfortunately, the mental health industry is full of egotists indoctrinated with an us-and-them mentality. If a therapist is not altruistically motivated to be concerned for victims, when the client’s condition becomes critical, and the therapist is forced to choose between them and their café lifestyle, registration, reputation, research, business, overseas holidays, long weekends, interstate conference with all-inclusive wine tour, private school fees, regular restaurant dining, latest Tinder date , intellectual pursuits, social recognition, or personal safety – they will not choose the client. Most therapists will sell out and suddenly chang e a client’s diagnosis to ‘mentally ill’ the moment the client exposes their professional inadequacy, insincerity, incompetence, and unwillingness to deviate from their ‘money for old rope ’ routine. If a victim bonds with one of these secular professionals for the purpose of processing extreme abuse, they risk being prematurely abandoned at a most crucial time. It is safer not to commence the recovery process at all, rather than die halfway through. And do not think the therapist will take responsibility for their part in the victim’s downfall. They will justify their abandonment according to their code of therapeutic engagement and management,"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":" 409 and ultimately blame the victim for their poor choices. The client was after all, just another personality disordered nut, and they have a filing cabinet full of those to fill the void. All mental health workers reserve their perceived right to hide behind a façade of professionalism. Arrogant or not, they will in times of stress, fear, or ignorance, revert to this default setting. Every psychologist and psychiatrist I have ever consulted fits this behavioural pattern. Here is an example: I once thought I had found the perfect psychiatrist . This woman claimed to be a Christian, EMDR trained, and highly experienced at working with ritual abuse and mind control. The psychiatrist made a time to see me at short notice . B y the time of my appointment, she had watched my Candy Girl documentary plus my Seattle conference presentation. I was impressed. The doctor bulkbilled my session to Medicare, listened intently to me, offered sound advice, prescribed a novel medication that I found beneficial, and agreed to be available if and when I ever needed a medico-legal report. Perfect... or so I thought. I remained in light contact with the psychiatrist, sent her the odd text or email. The day came when I needed a medico-legal report. It had been 18 months since my initial consultation with the psychiatrist, when I confidently requested an appointment and a report. I was surprised by her email response: _____________________________________________ I have only been able to do ... supportive reports as appropriate for patients that I am treating. I would have thought your psychologist, GP and neurologist reports are credible ... I have not done a psychiatric assessment of you ... but supportive meeting x2 years ago... I remember you telling me you are not dissociative... and whilst I accept the veracity of yo ur statement, I have not seen anyone in clinical practice who has experienced severe CSA from preschool age and primary school age who had not had severe dissociation ... even DID... as an adaptive response to deal with the intolerable ... Complex PTSD do es in my clinical view involve dissociation... I also have some concern that being interstate makes my clinical opinion potentially vulnerable ... I have had to battle in court in the past against a senior colleague who accused me of having ‘a major confi rmatory bias’... whilst the court outcome was successful for the victim, I was able to challenge as my assessment was detailed and there was medical and protective co -oberation. It would seem that your residual struggles impacting on your functioning are neurological and somatic predominately ... I am involved in current medico legal cases in which I have to be so meticulous.... I would have thought you would have had more than enough from what you have gathered already. ________________________________ _____________ ‘So, she called you a fraud, Fiona?!’ my psychologist exclaimed. ‘Well, she didn’t exactly say that-...’ ‘Yes, she basically did, ’ he insisted.

I never told her I wasn’t dissociative. I said I’ m co-conscious during dissociation, and that my alter switches are seamless due to the sophisticated techniques and equipment used. She watched the Seattle conference video in which I talked all about that, and about the exact nature of my dissociation and integration.’ ‘Why did she do this?’ ‘I don’t know. Threatened, I guess.’ ‘She might have been a setup. Or she’s going to set you up, Fiona.’ ‘After everything I’ve done for victims all these years, at great personal risk, I ask for one thing, just one report – but no.’ ‘You’ve done enough. Time to stop saving the world.’ ‘Oh, trust me – I’m nearly cured of that .’ He laughed. I sighed . ‘ So, c an you recommend a new psychiatrist?’ ‘Er, no.’ ‘Huh?’ ‘I don’t think any of them will want to get involved.’ ‘Why not?’ ‘Because you’re Fiona Barnett.’ * * * Alternatively, victims can line up at one of the community -based counselling services affiliated with the church denominations currently under the Royal Commission investigation for covering up child abuse. Non-government organisations dedicated solely to child abuse counselling are poorly staffed and are typically infiltrated with perpetrators. Child actor Sarah Monahan documented how Bravehearts tried to sabotage her lawsuit against the actor who sexually abused her on-set of the Hey Dad TV show. Paul Wilson’s wife was on the Bravehearts advisory board. Following her husband’s pedophile conviction, Bravehearts replaced her with the Bond University lecturer / Queensland Police detective who lied to destroy my psychology career. Complex trauma resulting from severe child abuse requires years of therapy. During critical recovery times, multiple weekly sessions need to be interspersed with a residential care facility staffed by experts with specialist training. Unfortunately, no such thing exists in Australia. During the late 1980s and ‘90s, a standard therapy session lasted 60 minutes. The victim of severe child abuse could expect to attend two sessions per week. At university, I was taught that the APS recommended 1.5 -hour sessions for highly traumatised victims to ensure they did not leave therapy in a hyper -aroused state. However, income greedy modern practitioners only offer one 50-minute therapy session per week. In accordance with industry guidelines, they deduct 10 minutes per hour for writing case notes and reports. Fifty minutes per week is ridiculously insufficient for victims of extreme child abuse to process their experiences."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":" 411 Experienced psychologists may charge around $330 per session. Inexperienced or unskilled psychologists are usually desperate for clientele and therefore more willing to be paid $130 per hour to counsel victims of crime. Psychology receives scarce funding from the Australian government. Presently, Medicare will cover about six therapy sessions, which is just enough therapy to trigger a victim to suicide. Psychiatry is completely funded via Medicare and therefore more accessible to victims who have been too busy surviving to earn high incomes. The moment you engage a therapist under a government scheme like Medica re, your personal information is recorded in a powerful system that may come back to bite you. Your case notes can be subpoenaed, and your diagnoses used against you in educational, professional, and legal settings. Therapists often operate within clinical teams, attend supervision, and debrief with peers, friends or relatives. In this way, therapists may unwittingly disclose your identity and whereabouts to your perpetrators. If your therapist knowingly reports to the network, they may use their position and connections to set you up for false internment in prison or hospital where victims are silenced. As a precaution, engage a counsellor who ranks low on the mental health power hierarchy, use a pseudonym, and pay in cash. * * * APS MK-ULTRA Perpetrator s The following heads of the APS (Australian Psychological Society) are known MK-ULTRA perpetrators: ABBPS Chairpersons 1955-1956 Oscar Adolph Oeser 1957-1958 Cecil A.

He said, ‘You’re doing all the talking. We want to hear from her. I’m sure she has something to say.’ Tap-tap-tap . . . I returned to the room. You must talk . I am ordering you to talk. She scowled a t me with contempt and spoke: You think I’m stupid . ‘What did she say?’ my therapist asked. ‘She said, “You think I’m stupid!”’ ‘ Ohhh , so you think she’s stupid.’ ‘Well,’ I stumbled, ‘ I think she’s . . . all action.’ ‘So, you think she’s stupid. Well, isn’t that nice. That must make her feel really accepted.’ Tap-tap-tap . . . Look , I began sheepishly, I appreciate everything you’ve done.

Suddenly - the scene changed. I was in the Holsworthy underground. The rough walls were carved out of rock. A small girl sat on the ground before me. She looked no more than eight years old. Her auburn curls sat in layers. She was sobbing aloud. Her tears drew clean lines down her filthy face. A gun was slung over her shoulder. ‘Why don’t you approach her?’ my therapist asked. ‘Because she’s holding an AK -forty-seven !’ ‘Talk to her.

I tilted my head to one side, smiled with pity, prised the gun from her little hands, scooped her tiny frame into my arms and hugged her close. Her entire body began to convulse against my chest. It’s okay , I assured her. I’m so sorry. I began stroking her hair which fell off in a clump, revealing long, straight blonde hair. It was just a wig. They dressed me in a wig to create another alter who assumed responsibility for the killings. ‘She’s just a little kid, ’ I gasped. ‘Yep, she’s just a kid,’ my therapist echoed. I returned to the meeting room where Sascha had sat. Instead of the angry warrior, I saw a petite teenage girl dressed in khaki, staring shamefully at the floor. She sighed in resignation as she pulled off her auburn wig to reveal long straight blonde hair. ‘They’re just children,’ I shook my head. ‘ Both are children. They’re minors.’ ‘Yes, the y are.

Eventually I settled, wiped my blurry eyes , and spoke. ‘My daughter made me do a personality test.’ He laughed. ‘ Which one.’ ‘I don’t know, some vocational test. She’s doing an intro psych unit and the lecturer has the class playing around with personality tests. She hassled me until I agreed to do it. She reckoned it was accurate. So, I did it.

That test showed me I have a personality beneath the PTSD. I have a good, healthy personality that has nothing to do with my abuse.’ * * * Australia’s Therapeutic Wasteland I processed the first half of my abuse, primarily incest and ritual abuse experiences, during the early 1990s. My last drawings of that memory retrieval phase showed my being spun in an egg-like contraption in a CIA lab beneath ANSTO. I showed the drawings to my mother who asserted, ‘ That’s enough now. You don’ t need to remember anymore.’ So, I stopped. Stopping the memories was probably a good decision since I had insufficient therapeutic support at the time. Although I had seen psychiatrists since my sixteenth birthday, they caused more harm than good. The first committed suicide. The second failed his final psychiatry examination six times. The third dismissed my PTSD flashbacks of ritual abuse as a ‘metaphor for incest, ’ and his nursing staff mocked me as I lay in a foetal position beneath my hospital bed, screaming at vivid images of babies being murdered. I defiantly poked my 20 -year-old finger at the useless physician’s face and asserted that while I may not have understood my memories, I refused to deny them. I also refused to numb myself with their vile drugs. I was on my own. I had no way of understanding what I was experiencing. Australia offered no experts, no books, and the internet had not been invented. So, I implemented the only thing my state school education taught me – how to teach myself. I set about researching my condition. After completing art college, I fell into post graduate studies in art therapy. That course contained an introductory unit of psychology. The study of psychology seemed more scientific than drawing Jungian mandalas, so I transferred to that. Psychology, followed by motherhood, led me to my ultimate passion – gifted education. The combination of academic knowledge of psychology, art psychotherapy, and gifted education, formed the foundation of my escape from the matrix. I also fell into supporting victims of ritual abuse and mind control, where I discovered how to bypass the conscious mind and access implicit memories using drawing. Finally, 25 years after my first flashback, I possessed the knowledge, skill, and fortitude to finish the task. I found therapists capable of executing my design. B ut don’ t mistake this"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":" 419 for s ome kind of happy ending. None of these practitioners wanted me on their books. Like most Australian therapists, they were clueless about ritual abuse and mind control. Yet this time round, I refused to let therapist inadequac y interfere with my goal. I planned every step of my integration process and hammered my therapists to help implement my plan. Eventually, my 35-year marathon paid off. I remembered what was done to me and why, which smashed the programming and facilitated integration. Why Integrate? Research indicates the re are benefits to integration. One study found, ‘Patients with dissociative disorder who integrated their dissociated self-states were found to have reduced symptomatology compared with those who did not integrate.’ 469 I was relatively high functioning immediately prior to integrating. I’m not saying I was perfectly healthy, but I was certainly as stable as 99 percent of the mental health workers I have ever met. Victims like me often present as high functioning, which is why victims are over-represented in the helping professions. Victims can compartmentalise their lives into roles (which is the only benefit of forced dissociation). For example, prior to my stroke, I coped easily with doing two master level degrees at once. I could totally immerse myself in academic study from dawn to midni ght and block out all else. I felt most relaxed when writing research papers about complex issues; in a state of Csikszentmihalyi’s ‘flow.’ Victims like me feel comfortable and function optimally under extreme stress. We perform amazingly under pressure in hospital emergency rooms and under cross examination in the court room. We are the type you want in a life -threatening situation like a terror attack. But don’t ask us to stand in aisle six and decide which brand of tea to purchase . Soldiers with PTSD do the same, perform brilliantly in the field yet fail to cope with simple decisions at home. Someone has to take that slack. Before integration, I was impossibly demanding and stressful to live with. My children were vicariously traumatised to the point where they needed therapy themselves. My family felt responsible for fixing a situation only integration could alleviate. My husband’s health was adversely affected by his constantly trying to placate me and juggle my mood swings. Our family safety was compromised by the vulnerability dissociation brings because a dissociative victim is accessible . Perpetrators trigger victims to keep the programming active, force the victim into error as part of a set-up, or access and instruct them under hypnosis. When a victim is triggered by something that reminds them of the past, their right brain hemisphere is activated and reacts as if the trauma incident were presently occurring. They may feel angry, afraid, dizzy, and or nauseous, for example. Because their left brain is deactivated during a trigger, they do not know they are reliving a childhood trauma. Instead, they think they are emotionally reacting to something that is happening now. The left brain mistakes this right brain emotional perception as new stimuli related to the current surroundings and sets about doing its job of sequencing and ascribing context. It pins the blame on someone or thing in the victim’s immediate environment. I typically blamed my husband and kids. 469 B. Brand, C. Classen, S. McNary, & P. Zaveri (2009). A Review of Dissociative Disorders Treatment Studies. The Journal of nervous and mental disease . 197. 646 -54."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":" 420 Trauma-Based Forced Dissociation damages the frontal lobes and splits these areas from the remaining brain. The frontal lobes conduct the brain, like someone conducts an orchestra. Frontal lobe executive dysfunction impairs the victim’s ability to plan, organise, concentrate, remember, multi-task, make decisions, control emotions, put the brakes on inappropriate behaviour, and find the motivation to start a job task. The result is chaos, like when every instrument in an orchestra plays a different tune. When someone is not integrated, the burden of their chaotic mind falls onto others, mainly family. It takes a team of mental health workers, plus many thousands of dollars, to manage a dissociative client’s daily life. The workload and associated costs are severely reduced by int egration. I integrated because I hate pain. I could not stand the physical pain caused by dissociation. I could not stand that sickly, confused sense of dread that consumed my being at Halloween and other significant ritual dates. I was tired of unconscious trauma memories manifesting as depression, anxiety, terror, anger, hypervigilance, nightmares, and inexplicable mood swings. I was tired of losing control of my emotions and will. My entire life was one big trauma response. Prior to integration, every decision I made was informed by my trauma experiences. Sleep disturbance is another reason to integrate. Prior to dealing with my issues I suffered dreadful sleep disturbances. In my youth I awoke from nightmares, screaming. I had trouble falling and staying asleep. A clue to the relevance of consistent sleep is found in the following extract: A study was carried out at Stanford University some years ago concerning the nature of brainwashing ... Not interruption of sleep but lack of dreaming was important. Theories now suggest that what we experience during the day is processed through dreams at night; when this continuity is broken , we lose our psychological equilibrium and controls . 470 Sleep is essential for processing. Victims are typically programmed not to sleep, to stop them processing, remembering and integrating. I slept soundly for the first time in my life, after processing my ritual abuse memories in my early 20s. Integration is Not a Cure -All I had hoped integration would completely cure my PTSD. It didn’ t. Complex PTSD may be a permanent, developmental condition. The standard treatment for PTSD involves convincing the client that although they were unsafe during the original trauma, they are safe now. The problem is, the victim must remove herself from the source of trauma in order to heal. In the case of victims of ritual abuse and mind control, the abuse is ongoing thanks to perpetual harassment from the trafficking network. Thus, my fellow victims and I have never had the chance to completely recover. Another limitation is that the brain only has so much plasticity when it comes to reversing personality changes forcibly created during development. It is like sending a young 470 John Collier & Malcolm Collier (1986). Visual Anthropology: Photography as a Research Method .

Similarly, I can’t easily switch back to the introvert I was until age three years. While a victim’s brain can’t be completely restored as though it were never tampered with, successful integration achieves remarkable clarity of mind and dramatic symptom reduction, making it a worthwhile goal. Integration completely removed many symptoms of forced dissociation, and dramatically reduced the intensity and duration of my PTSD symptomology. The difference between dissociation and integration is like comparing a nightmare with dawn. Integrate Wh ile Young I tried to fully integrate in the early 1990s but lacked the therapeutic support to do so. Consequently, I had to wait another 25 years to finish the process. I found integration extra physically and mentally gruelling due to my older age. Young people bounce back more easily. With integration I began noticing the physical pain my body had always been in, particularly the nerve damage years of elec trocution caused. My integration correlated with a sharp decline in my neurological health including memory and concentration. I think it caused brain damage. So, I recovered mentally just in time to begin my physical decline into old age. I integrated too late to do something constructive with my life. I am now too old and disabled to work, to start all over again in some career . Had I integrated 30 years ago I might have been able to establish myself in a chosen profession unheeded by susceptibility to triggers. Most importantly, I woke from my dissociative slumber to realise my kids were grown, and that I had not been psychologically (or sometimes physically) present for them. I longed to experience motherhood all over again with an in-tact mind. These are the reasons I recommend victims pursue integration in their you th. Recipe for Therapy Success I will now explain what worked for me and why. I will offer my approach to the forced dissociation typically encountered within ritual abuse and MK -ULTRA mind control. I am not presenting my experience as a set formula for fixing this type of abuse. Like I said, no two cases are identical. Each victim’s abuse is individually tailored to their unique combination of personality, environmental, and other variables. Individual subject characteristics, t he quality of technology used, plus perpetrator skill , shape how abuse manifests in a victim’s therapy and daily life. For example, my perpetrators were the MK-ULTRA pioneers and used military grade equipment. When I was spun (as all victims are) it was on sophisticated equipment instead of a home -made spit roast set-up. A further example of difference is, I received a Grande Dame version of the Princess programming other victims report experiencing . These differences likely contributed to the following: (a) My personality switches were comparatively seamless and manifested as mood swings, instead of blatant Sybil style switching. (b) I was co-conscious during therapy, while most victims remain dissociative and typically emerge from a session oblivious to what just occurred. (c) I have never heard voices, when m ost of the DID survivors I know do so. I tested highly intuitive, creative and intelligent. This may explain how I designed and drove my own therapy process in the required direction. I trusted that my implicit memory knew where to go, based on its intimate knowledge of what Gittinger did to me . Further, I"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":" 422 had experienced therapy both as a client and a practitioner, which armed me with understanding of how people’s brains typically respond to therapy, how trauma memories behave, and how productive therapy feels. Another factor to consider is, my experience of ritual abuse and mind control is the most extreme example imaginable, incorporating the entire menu of child abuse possibilities. Therefore, my integration was destined to be unusually complicated, intense, and dangerous. So, to reiterate – do not use my experience as a blueprint for recovery. My Aim The purpose of this chapter, and the entire book, is to validate victim’s memories and trigger new ones. For therapists, I provide clues regarding what happened to their clients, and suggestions for guiding victims on the healing path. The most important thing therapists say I provide them is an understanding of the programming and the roles played by dissociative parts. Therapists say I have helped them to: realise what questions to ask of clients; gain the trust of dissociated parts; relieve the guilt and shame felt by parts; convey belief and validation of client experience ; relieve repressed emotion; and make sense of the trauma experience. My primary aim is to provide victims with a sense of hope in the face of impossible adversity. My message is this: If I can do it, if I can survive the ultimate abuse experience, so can you. There is a way out of your unique programming matrix, and with persistence and trust in your Right Hemisphere, your implicit brain will lead the way. Definitions Understanding begins with appropriate language usage. Psychology and psychiatry are saturated with language and labels that simply do not explain or match my abuse experiences. Consequently, I have adapted or created my own relevant terms. Trauma -Based Forced Dissociation is where a victim is intentionally traumatised, using refined techniques, to artificially induce the brain’s natural ability to dissociate. To explain, the brain is created with a defence system that kicks in when overwhelmed by sensory input. Consequently , when someone goes through the windscreen during a car crash, they might recall the moment prior to this, or perhaps the ambulance ride afterwards, but typically not the moment of impact. The brain naturally dissociates to protect the person from feeling overwhelmed by the trauma. In 1991, psychiatrist John Briere conducted a study of post-traumatic dissociation in 450 male and female adults receiving therapy for child sexual abuse. On average, the abuse started at age 6.5 years, lasted 11 years, and involved two perpetrators. Near 60 percent of subjects experienced abuse -related amnesia before the age of 18 years. The study also showed the likelihood of memory repression increased with certain variables: abuse at an earlier age, longer duration, and greater violence (e.g., multiple perpetrators, physical injur y, threat of death if victim disclosed). 471 471 John Briere & John Conte (1993). Self -reported amnesia for abuse in adults molested as children. J Trauma Stress , 6:21."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":" 423 Dirty doctors, psychologists, and neuroscientists conducted unethical research experiments to understand this natural dissociation phenomenon. They discovered how sensory overload techniques (including spinning, torture, auditory and visual stimulation, and psychotropic drugs) coupled with unethical hypnosis, could induce dissociation on demand. The result of trauma-based forced dissociation is a compartme ntalised brain. Each ‘alter’ sits isolated behind amnesia walls and possesses its own network of neural circuitry. Experts in personality and motivation then load each isolated brain section with an independent set of memories and personality characteristics. The abusers also intentionally create neural circuits which act as thought loop traps, so that instead of processing the abuse memories, the victim’s mind gets stuck in unproductive thought cycles in the form of intellectualisation, or obsessive thoughts. Integration is the retracing and unravelling of the forced dissociation process. Integration results when the victim’s brain overwrites the unhealthy neural pathways that perpetrators created via unethical conditioning , and then rewrites those pathways with new knowledge. This process depends on neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to change. Belief in the brain’s plasticity is what enables the victim to cut replacement neural pathways and so achieve integration. To illustrate, I suffered a vestibular system stroke in 2009 which affected my vision and balance. Following the stroke, I could not balance on one leg, when immediately prior to my injury I attended a weekly acrobatics class in which I effortlessly performed front walkovers. Thinking my stroke was in the visual processing system, I embarked upon a relevant rehabilitation program. While this did restore a significant amount of functioning including improved balance, a vestibular rehabilitation program six years later was life changing. My rehabilitation therapists attributed my success to my belief in neuroplasticity, in the brain’s ability to cut new neural pathways to bypass my stroke damage. They drew comparison to a physiotherapy student who failed the same therapy program simply because he did not believe it could work. My point is, victims must have faith in the therapy process. They must believe their subconscious brain knows exactly what happened to them and will tell them what steps to take in order to heal. In fact, the victim’s brain will usually know better than any therapist. Trauma -Focussed therapy identifies and processes the traumatic incidents that initially caused the dissociation. It treats the cause instead of the symptoms of dissociation. Nothing substantial results from topical therapy techniques that superficially manage anxiety and depression, or which focus on meeting every dissociative part. The MK -ULTRA perpetrators know this, which is why their modern therapy approaches designed to keep victims in a perpetual state of dissociation, helplessness, vulnerability, and dependence on a psychiatric system that has failed to heal since its inception 100 years ago. Developmental Trauma Injury is a permanent condition caused by chronic early childhood trauma. This condition has no name within mainstream psychiatry, notably the DSM. While it lacks a name, it therefore has no treatment and can be misattributed to other"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":" 424 inappropriate and unhelpful labels. This problem is by design, since psychiatry traditionally taught doctors that child abuse has zero harmful effects. Two DSM labels that mainstream psychiatry and psychology use are DID (formerly MPD) and PTSD. These terms do not adequately capture the complexity of ritual abuse and mind control. Trauma has its greatest impact during a child’s first decade and becomes more like PTSD with age. So, PTSD does not accurately describe the impact of childhood trauma on a developing brain. The terms Complex Trauma and Complex PTSD have been used by trauma- focussed therapists, but they too are developmentally insensitive and not listed in the DSM. Van Der Kolk 472 provided an argument for the inclusion of Developmental Trauma Disorder in the DSM-5; however, the word ‘ disorder’ beguiles the criminal nature of what was inflicted upon victims. I think Developmental Trauma Injury best describes the impact of early - onset child abuse on development. Nature of Trauma-Based Dissociation Treating mind control victims requires an understand of what the perpetrators did to cause the dissociation. Knowing removes the power that mystery has over the victim and transitions the victim from learned helplessness into feeling empowered to act. Cons cious awareness is the key to rupturing and collapsing the programming, just like the final scene of The Matrix film. The MK -ULTRA mind control process is based on trauma. Trauma is employed at every step of the way. Trauma is used to: create the initial attachment violation; b ond victims to their perpetrators; fragment the brain into multiple personalities; p rogram or condition a victim; and e nhance a victims’ natural abilities. Since mind control is trauma based, it is essential for victims and therapists to understand how perpetrators manipulate the human body’s natural trauma response, and treat victims using a trauma-focussed therapy approach. There is a known typical response to chronic trauma experienced during childhood. This response kicks in when a child is exposed to multiple occurrences of sexual, physical or psychological abuse, or neglect. This trauma response is what most leading psychologists and psychiatrists in the 1950s - 70s were CIA-funded to study and artificially induce within a laboratory setting. Considered in the context of ritual abuse and mind control, the trauma process reveals how and why CIA perpetrators manipulated it. CIA-funded scientists mapped exactly which part of the brain does what. The public have not been granted access to this information. Instead, a general idea of perpetrator methods is obtained from examining and comparing: what mainstream therapists know about the effects of chronic childhood trauma ; the relationship of this to the attachment process; the con tent of mainstream scientific research publications relevant to trauma and memory ; and the wealth of knowledge stored in victims’ implicit memory. Victims typically know what was done to them and why. Gittinger stored this information somewhere in my brai n, in preparation for my becoming a programmer. While I do not immediately recall this content, if I follow a hunch it invariably leads to a flood of recall. 472 B. van der Kolk (2005).

"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":" 425 Implicit Trauma Memory Storage A RIGHT → LEFT → RIGHT model of hemispheric processing makes sense of how the brain processes trauma. The right hemisphere is emotional, intuitive, tactile, and visual- spatial. It receives new stimuli including sight, taste, smell, sound, touch, and body position. The right brain functions implicitly. Its implicit functions include attention, learning, thinking, and memory. It communicates non-verbally via facial expression and body language. The left hemisphere compares new information with known information. It sequences and categorises new based on previous experience , which stamps the experience with a time - date-place . The left brain applies simple language to a new experience so it may be discussed by the victim. Different types of memory are supported by different brain systems. One major distinction exists between short and long -term memory. Long-term memory i s further divided into Implicit and Explicit memory. Explicit memory is conscious , verbal, and comparative. It is stored in the left hemisphere. Implicit memory is non-conscious, non -verbal, and is stored in the right hemisphere. Implicit memories include visual images, emotions, and body sensations. The right brain unconsciously stores and responds to emotions, faces, gestures, places, smells, sounds, and touch that a victim experienced in c hildhood. Body sensations are unconsciously regulated by the autonomic nervous system (which controls heartbeat, blood flow, breathing, digestion, etc). Hence a direct link between implicit memories and body reactions. Traumatic memories are not processed like ordinary ones. Trauma causes the explicit memory system to fail and the implicit memory system to activate instead. Trauma experiences enter the right hemisphere. They are not passed to the left hemisphere for processing. Consequently, trauma memories remain fragmented and stuck in the right hemisphere as unconscious pictures, emotions, and physical sensations. Trauma memories lack the left -brain sequencing that makes sense of experience , and the language application needed to verbally describe experience. This is how repressed trauma memories form, and how the body remembers what the conscious mind forgets. The body remembers what the conscious mind forgets. Research indicates trauma and dissociation are localised in the implicit right brain. For instance, fMRI research shows mainly right hemispheric activation in PTSD patients during dissociation. 473 Further, flashbacks activate the right hemisphere and deactivate the left . Specifically , Brodmann’s area 19 lights up in the right brain while Broca’s area blacks out in the left. Flashbacks simultaneously activate the right brain and deactivate the left . Hippocampal Bypass 473 Lanius et al. (2005). Functional connectivity of dissociative responses in posttraumatic stress disorder: a functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation. Biol Psychiatry . Apr 15 , 57: 8, 873- 84."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":" 426 The hippocampus is essential for certain forms of learning and memory. Autobiographical memories rely on hippocampal processing and storage of what , where and when life events occur. The hippocampus is associated with implicit memory, including relational memory for face-scene pairings, incidental learning, long-term memory retrieval, and rapid associative learning. Chronic trauma damages the hippocampus and causes difficulty with storing and recalling information. During a trauma event, the flood of sensor y information short-circuits the hippocampus. Trauma memories, including emotions and visual images, bypass hippocampal processing and move directly to implicit memory where they stay undigested, perpetually stuck in the age at which the trauma happened. Mainstream scientists recently developed a prosthetic hippocampus. When a brain receives sensory input, it creates a memory that travels through multiple areas of the hippocampus. The signal is re -encoded at each area until it reaches the final region as a completely different signal that is sent off for long -term storage. DARPA (US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) commissioned university and hospital scientists to create an artificial memory system that interfered with this encoding system. 474 Researchers identified a brain’s neural firing patterns, synthesised a neural firing code from this, and used an electrode implant to communicate this code. They then bypassed a section of neural pathway in the hippocampus and used their implant to bridge this gap by relaying the implant’s neural message, in the brain’s own code. Publications on this project have been vague and varied. Depending on what we read, the device reportedly bypasses the hippocampus, is a hippocampal implant, forms new long - term memori es, creates short-term memories, creates implicit memories, reinforces learning, replaces memory, or improves memory. Whatever the description, DARPA, who are solely into weaponizing everything they fund, developed a brain implant that can be used to impla nt implicit conditioning (programming), repress memory, and create false memories. Declassified documents reveal the US military have long possessed science and technology that is decades in advance of mainstream publication. It is therefore plausible that MK-ULTRA perpetrators possessed the technology for manipulating the hippocampus back in the 1970s. Pavlovian Fear Conditioning The hippocampus plays a role in regulating the fear response. Hippocampal damage prevents the person consciously remembering they were conditioned to fear something - but does not affect the actual fear conditioning itself. Also, strong emotions including fear naturally bypass the hippocampus and prove hard to extinguish. The fear response is an example of classical conditioning, a type of implicit memory which formed the basis of MK -ULTRA mind control. Pavlov (1927) paired a bell (conditioned stimulus) with a shock (unconditioned stimulus). This pairing triggered an aversive emotional state (fear) at the sound of the bell. The conditioned stimulus elicits an innate behavioural response, plus physiological responses controlled by the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine systems. 474 Robert E Hampson et al (2018). Developing a hippocampal neural prosthetic to facilitate human memory encoding and recall. J. Neural Eng , 15."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":" 427 Classical conditioning develops and maintains PTSD. Orval Hobart Mowrer’s (1960) Two-Factor Learning Theory incorporated classical and operant conditioning. The first factor is learning by association (classical conditioning). The second factor is instrumental learning (avoidance behaviour) which involves consistent avoidance of both the conditioned stimulus (bell) and the unconditioned stimulus (electrocution). This theory explains PTSD triggers. The fear generated by child abuse is associated with other cues (e.g., medical procedures) which are avoided by the victim. At age 10 years, I was conditioned with the fear response as follows. ANSTO staff strapped my body to a medical bed and connected my brain to an EEG. They electrocuted my chest with paddles every time the EEG monitor indicated I was starting to fall asleep. This produced terror, a heart reaction, and an adrenalin surge. Consequently, when extremely threatened in adulthood, my fear triggered a physical sensation, a fla shback. Every time I began falling asleep, I was jolted awake by a massive adrenalin surge, chest pain, and a heart that exceeded 240 beats per minute – perhaps higher, as that was the measurement device’s threshold. Flashbacks are resurfacing visual images, sounds, smells, emotions, and physical sensations that were stored in the right brain’s implicit memory during a trauma experience, and which flash into conscious awareness unchanged by the passing of time. During flashbacks, victims experience the images, emotions, and physical sensations they experienced during the trauma incident (which became frozen in time and remained undigested in the right hemisphere ) as if they are experiencing them for the first time. My first and clearest visual flashback occurred in 1991. I was sitting in a hospital bed when t he room completely disappeared, and an entirely different scene appeared. It was like someone suddenly changed the channel on an enormous television screen. Suddenly I was looking close -up at a waterfall of blood cascading in slow motion. At the time I had no idea what I was seeing. After drawing the experience, I realised this was a memory from when I was five years old. I was kneeling in front of a table with my hands tied behind my back. My step-grandfather and his next-door neighbour were murdering the neighbour’s three-year- old son on a makeshift altar in his front room. I was drugged, which explains why everything was a little fuzzy and moving in slow motion during my flashback. My most bizarre visual flashback occurred early one morning, when I was hung over from a party the night before. I awoke in a mildly dissociative state due to vertigo. I was disturbed by light streaming through the window. Every time I closed my eyes, I experience d something like a black -and-white film being projected onto the back of my eyelids. I saw landscape moving away from me at a rapid pace. I opened my eyes, thinking I was imagining things, then closed them again. Next, I saw landscape moving toward me. I stayed with the image and soon realised it was a visual flashback. I was riding in the back of an army jeep with a unit of male soldiers dressed in combat gear and carrying guns. When I looked toward the front of the vehicle, I saw two soldiers, a driver, and a passenger wearing a helmet and holding a gun. When I looked out the rear of the jeep, I saw we were driving on a dirt road. The landscape resembled Australia, but it wasn’t. I explored this memory further using EMDR and remembered I was in Central America at age 14. I Googled the guns, uniforms, and landscape I saw in my visual flashback and concluded it was Nicaragua."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":" 428 My most memorable physical sensation flashback occurred when I was asleep. I suddenly awoke at 1am, screaming and arching at being electrocuted when I was 10 years old. It felt exactly like being electrocuted in the here and now. I could feel a huge 50cm wide electrode on my back and the individual pin pricks of heat. I screamed like I was being murdered . My startled husband stuffed a pillow over my face for fear of the neighbours phoning the police , which didn’t help. Some flashbacks last days. On one occasion I had a flashback of being drugged. I felt stoned for three days. The most excruciating episode was a three -day pain flashback which I likened to drug-free childbirth. Valium did nothing to reduce the pain. Flashbacks like these are rare and increase in intensity and duration when the victim actively seeks integration. More commonly, repressed memories surface as comparatively mild physical sensations including: headaches, migraine, isolated external head pain, chest pain, limb pain, weakness, fatigue, sleepiness, racing heart, shortness of breath, dizziness, unsteadiness, vertigo, fainting, chest tightness, shaking, itchiness, sweat ing, nausea, stomach aches, numbness, tingling, surreal sense, choking sensation, hot flashes, cold chills, blurred vision, ringing in the ears, and irregular heartbeat. Victims, therapists, and doctors are typically clueless regarding the cause of these symptoms, so t hey treat them with drug s instead of identifying and treating the trauma that caused the symptoms . Other symptoms of survivors include grand mal epileptic seizures with a temporary cessation of breathing. Doctors managed to strap one survivo r to an EEG machine in the midst of a seizure – his brain waves registered normal – in other words, the fit was not a true grand mal, but a body memory of electric shocks years after the torture occurred. 475 State -Dependent Memory Flashbacks are triggered when the victim returns to the state of mind they were in at the time of the original trauma. This mechanism is based on the concept of state -dependent memory which determines that memory retrieval works best when a victim is in the same state of consciousness they were in when the memory was created. In 2015, researchers identified a brain mechanism that can (a) hide traumatic memories, and (b) retrieve those repressed memories. 476 Scientists administered to mice a drug that stimulates extra-synaptic GABA receptors. These receptors alter the brain's state and can make a person ‘aroused, sleepy, alert, sedated, inebriated or even psychotic.’ The drug made the mice mildly inebriated . The doped mice were put in a Skinner box and electrocuted. When the mice were returned to the same box the next day, they did not recall being electrocuted and so behaved normally. However, when scientists drugged them before putting them in the box again, the mice froze in fear. The mice remembered being electrocuted afte r they were returned to the same brain state created by the drug. 475 Alex Constantine (2014). Virtual Government: CIA Mind Control Operations in America.

Nature Neuroscience , 1 8, 1265 -71."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":" 429 This experiment demonstrates that: (a) extra-synaptic GABA receptors help to encode trauma memories and store them in the subconscious memory system; and (b) trauma that occurs while extra-synaptic GABA receptors are activated can’t be remembered unless the same receptors are reactivated. In lay terms, this study indicates that drugs and electrocution can be used to create, and then access, repressed t rauma memories. If a child is drugged while being electrocuted, the drug reroutes processing and forces the brain to store memories in the implicit system where they can’t be consciously accessed. To access the implicit memory, the brain must be returned to the same state of consciousness as when the memory was stored - the same emotional mood, physical place, activity, drug -induced condition, or hypnosis-induced dissociative state. The mice study suggests something else – that triggers may be used to retrieve repressed memories. Triggers are Treasures Trauma causes the child’s brain to create a neural pathway that is managed by the instinctual part of the brain. This lower brain area assumes control over brain and body functions including the fight-flight response. The new pathway is maintained by reminders of the original trauma. These reminders, or triggers, can be smells, tastes, sounds, sights, situations, or body movements. When exposed to the trigger, the child responds as if being traumatised again, and shifts into fight-flight mode. Perpetrators regularly retraumatise the victim throughout childhood and adulthood, to keep desired neural pathways open, unwanted neural pathways shut, and the final programming structure intact. The CIA and their complicit organisations employ agent scum, informants, and provocateurs to continually harass, set-up, and retraumatise adult victims. To the outsider, this highly organised, standardised operation looks like the victim is either paranoid or - as one of my friends labelled me - a ‘shit magnet.’ Victims of ritual abuse and mind control are conditioned to avoid triggers. People place trigger warnings at the start of videos and articles about the subject. Therapists are careful not to trigger their DID clients. In the early 1990s, therapists were taught to ‘respect patients’ defence mechanisms, ’ which was another way of saying, do not trigger clients. This avoidance of triggers is another means of keeping victims stuck in their trauma cycle. Since 1991, I have swum against the ignorant tide and encouraged victims to bulldoze through their defence mechanisms and embrace triggers. Triggers are the key to memory retrieval. Consider: when you lose your car keys, your memory must be triggered for you to recall where you left them. It’s a common-sense, right -brain concept. Triggers are the key to memory retrieval . Here is an email to my therapist which provides an extreme example of how I used triggering to retrieve my memories. My co-consciousness allowed me to steer the therapy process. Using EMDR as an ignition, I could dive into my subconscious mind, target specific memories, fish these out and draw them into my conscious awareness. _____________________________________"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":" 430 20/02/2015 3:08 PM This is what I need to do – I need to deal with the attachment violation.

I knowingly, stubbornly flogged my body to its limits. I could have suffered a heart attack while processing the worst of my memories. Ideally, I would have had a medical team on standby during this stage of my healing and completed the most intense work as an inpatient in a suitable clinic with nursing staff and therapists who knew what they were doing. But this does not exist in Australia, so I winged it. Integration is a dangerous, painful process, the risks of which should be car efully considered before commencing. Besides the risks associated with abreaction, know that memory recovery triggers the programmers’ built-in defence system. Each program is connected to a trauma incident which, when remembered, destroys the program. Consequently, programmers do everything to stop victims remembering their trauma. The programmers protect each program with a booby-trap which, when triggered, initiates conditioned pain, OCD thought loops, depression, anxiety, flooding, flashbacks, suicidal ideation, or the desire to self-harm. It is crucial for the victim to realise , these are not her thoughts, behaviours or will, but externally imposed thoughts and feelings. The victim must be relieved of the guilt and blame associated with artificially induced thoughts, feelings and behaviours. This includes being turned into a Manchurian Candidate and made to commit criminal acts they would otherwise shun from had they not been brainwashed zombies. Therapist Choice Integration starts with a suitable therapist. The last thing a victim needs is a lousy therapist who ditches them mid-integration. To maximise your chances of successful integration, select a therapist with a minimum 10 years of experience as a trauma-focussed practitioner. Ensure they possess advanced EMDR training and regularly update their skills at trauma-relevant workshops. You want someone stable who has worked on their own crap, and who entered the industry because they like helping people rather than to fix their own issues. Avoid someone who started off enthusiastic but has since become disillusioned with"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":" 432 the industry. Ask them how and why they ended up in psychology, and whether they themselves have experienced therapy. If they become defensive at your probing, wave goodbye. A therapist must be intelligent and intuitive enough to work with bright victims. Psychologists gained an idea of their IQ level while learning IQ testing. Ask your candidate therapist what their IQ is. If it is under 130, they will prove too left-brain dominant and narrow-minded, feel threatened by victims, not understand your cognitive style, and relish at every opportunity to disprove your intelligence. Sounds immature, but it happens all the time. Some therapists will even use the power imbalance to punish victims. You need a therapist who is open-minded enough to appreciate that reality stretches beyond the limits of their own experience, so they do not mistake our legitimat e experiences for insanity. You want someone who understands the spiritual dimension without erring toward the occult. Genuine Bible -believing Christian therapists are by far the best, but these are rare. Christianity is the cult’s favourite cover. Most churches are social clubs at best, child trafficking operations at worst. For this reason, avoid most church -based counselling services. Therapist Gender For all victims, there are benefits to experiencing both male and female therapists at different stages of their healing process. But the implications of therapist gender should be considered. Many therapists have sex with their clients. And I am not just talking about male therapists. Female therapists will seduce male or female clients. I know of a female therapist in my local area who had sex with a dissociative female client’s child alter. I researched the predator to find she was a proud member of the Freemason Order of the Eastern Star. Sometimes an unsuspecting therapist can be seduced. The sexual adv ances of a young, attractive female specifically trained to target and arouse men can be hard for male therapists to resist, since the male brain shuts down at a certain point during arousal. This is one way a victim will test the therapist. If he fails the test, he will likely meet a less attractive personality with combat skills. So, I recommend female victims engage a female therapist until the Beta alter is an integrated conscious brain component. Therapist Commitment Embarking upon the integration process is akin to boarding a roller coaster. Once the ride commences, the individual has three options: endure until the end when integration is achieved, be captured by the cult and reprogrammed, or jump. The therapist must commit to supporting the victim for the duration of the ride before it begins. Pulling out half-way can kill a client. It is the therapist’s responsibility to ensure they have the knowledge and skills to do the job, and not chicken out the moment things become uncomfortable – as they surely will. Trauma and Attachment The impact of trauma is buffered by a child’s attachment bond to their parents. If the attachment bond is missing, the child stops depending on others for help, and she can’t regulate her e motions. Consequently, she becomes anxious, angry, and long to be cared for. Perpetrators intentionally destroy the child’s natural attachment bond using torture to cause"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":" 433 overwhelming trauma. They then take advantage of the child’s longing for caring by using love bombing to create artificial attachment bonds between the child victim and her perpetrators. The bond between therapist and mind control victim is unique because it is influenced by the attachment violation perpetrated against the victim at a young age. The child’s natural attachment to their biological mother was purposely and viciously severed. The victim was artificially bonded to a surrogate mother, the Grande Dame. My attachment with this person was particularly strong, considering my Grande Dame candidacy which made her my mentor and confidant. To further complicate the usual therapeutic relationship, most abusers are psychologists or psychiatrists. All this guarantees the victim will displace their feelings for her abusers, plus their attachment issues, onto the therapist. Subsequently, apart from the standard cult harassment and threats, the therapist’s greatest challenge is managing the client -ther apist bond which must be firmly established before any major integration work starts. Therapeutic Bonding The therapist provides a substitute attachment until the victim can develop a secure internal attachment. This process took me 18 months and it was a terrifying act of trust. Bonding with a therapist is essential for memory access and brain integration. Once the bond occurs, and all personality fragments agree to trust the therapist with their lives, the victim automatically transfers all feelings for the perpetrators onto the therapist. The upside to this situation is, the therapist is granted unprecedented access to the victim’s mind and memories. The victim responds to the therapist’s voice and instruction like a robot. Such passivity enables the victim to be pacified during times of extreme distress, by the mere sound of the therapist’s voice. The downside to this bonding is, the victim is totally dependent on the therapist for as long as the portal to her past is open. At each trauma, bout of excruciating pain, wave of fear or terror, the victim seeks the therapist’s voice - like when a screaming baby settles upon hearing her mother. If that voice does not come , the victim’s pain and panic escalate. As in a mother-child relationship, the victim is pacified by just knowing the therapist is contactable. Much internal chaos can be avoided if the therapist is merely available. A sense of availability reduces the number of times the victim needs to physically contact the therapist. If the therapist is largely unavailable, if the victim must demand, beg and work for every minute of productive therapy received, this exacerbates the victim’s frustration, anger, exhaustion, and the sense that she is losing her mind. As part of the bonding process, every front personality fragment will manifest and test the therapist, to determine whether they are intelligent, ethical, caring, humble, and spiritual enough to see the process through to its conclusion. Even after the therapeutic relationship is established, the victim will test the therapist at regular intervals, to check they are sufficiently committed for the victim to progress to the next level. The therapist may be challenged on every aspect of their existence. This makes the victim demanding, yet her demands are purpose driven: t he victim is checking whether she will die during the encroaching integration process. The bonding process is exacerbated within the client if the therapist maintains an us- and-them mentality toward clients. All the above can be avoided if the therapist presents as"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":" 434 an equal to the client and discards the elitist attitudes typically fostered in therapists at university. Therapy only works once a mutual relationship, akin to friendship, is formed between the victim and therapist. Effective Therapy Approaches The therapeutic goal is to cut new neural pathways that allow the brain’s systems to work together. Effective therapy stimulates bilateral processing, releases the content of implicit memory, and lets the left brain transform right brain implicit emotional learnings and visual and somatic experiences into explicit verbal events. Effective therapy enables the victim to identify and verbalise their em otions and make logical sense of the trauma experience, so they can cognitively respond rather than emotionally react to triggers. Responding involves the victim consciously recognising they have been triggered and taking practical steps to stimulate their vagus nerve and calm their sympathetic fight-flight system. The therapeutic goal is to make all brain systems work together. The Integration Process ‘Phase-orientated’ therapy for DID follows these set treatment stages: 1. Establish safety, stabilisation and symptom reduction. 2. Contain and process trauma memories and feelings. 3. Integration and rehabilitation. 477 Treating DID that stems from ritual abuse and mind control is not so simple for two reasons: (1) Our abuse is ongoing due to constant targeting ; and (2) Our brain splits were intentionally, not organically, created. If you can follow this neat pattern – great. I could not. My treatment was a messy blur. I did identify a sequence to the memory retrieval process. I repeated three basic steps for each trauma incident: 1. Remember 2. Articulate 3. Abreact. If I processed a memory according to these steps, it never bother ed further . Sometimes revisited the same event that I experienced in more than one state of consciousness, in more than one personality state, or from a different physical position. For example, I processed being near drowned in a ritual pool in a cavern system beneath ANSTO and Holsworthy. Years later, I had to process this same experience, only this time it was a memory of being suspended in the air above the pool. My brain had somehow stored the single event as two separate experiences. 477 International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (2011): Guidelines for Treating Dissociative Identity Disorder in Adults, Third Revision, Journal of Trauma & Dissociation , 12:2, 115 -187."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":" 435 Trauma memory recall typically starts with the victim experiencing a nightmare, emotion, visual image, or body sensation flashback. The victim then attends therapy which focusses on that symptom. Effective therapy accesses the visual images of the trauma incident, body sensations, and emotions experienced during the childhood trauma. The victim must verbally describe the trauma incident. At some stage, she must feel the repressed emotion that occurred with the abuse; this may be delayed, hitting the person the following day. Ongoing therapy intervention and aftercare are essential to the integration process. Drawing the abuse incident provides further detail and clarity. Swimming aids hemispheric digestion and soothes the sympathetic nervous system. According to this sequence, I processed the first half of my memories using art therapy, and the second half using EMDR in conjunction with drawing. Internally, the process of art therapy and EMDR feel similar. Both bypass the unethical hypnosis, ECT, and drug effects to access implicit memory. Both allow victims to resurface and process trauma material at a manageable pace and intensity level. The brain only brings up what it can cope with at the time. The brain only raises what it can cope with at the time. Art Therapy Art therapy is both a learned skill and an intuitive artform. Anybody can acquire basic skills, but it takes innate creative ability to read a drawing like a brain scan and direct the process. The victim does not need artistic ability to do art the rapy. If they can draw stick figures, they can do art therapy. Besides, they soon free up and surprise themselves. The only material required are fat crayons in a range of colours and a pile of copying paper. It is important for the client to know that it does not matter whether what they draw is an actual event or a product of their imagination. All roads lead to Rome. The unconscious memory content will seep out in either symbolic or concrete form. Telling the client to ‘just guess’ what might have happened to them, accesses implicit memory and stimulates intuition. And I found that repeating an instruction at least three times helps to bypass unethical hypnosis. EMDR When I first heard about EMDR, I dismissed it as a hypnosis offshoot. Like hypnosis, EMDR is a form of bilateral stimulation. Unlike hypnosis, it is non-suggestive. There are two main ways of delivering EMDR: (1) D irected eye movements, or (2) A lternating bilateral hand taps. I experienced both. When dealing with the strongest memories in the lead up to integration, the therapist would wave a hand back and forth across my eyes. I would then sit back and wait for whatever came to mind. My next therapist had me place my hands face down on a pillow and alternatively tap the tops of my hands. During EMDR memory reprocessing, memories are retrieved from implicit memory, processed in working memory, and re-stored in long-term memory. The left brain reprocesses and reorganize the implicit trauma experiences; i t sequences the ev ent, applies context (time - date-place ), and finds language to describe what happened. The pivotal trauma memories must be retrieved and fully processed, including re -experiencing, or abreacting, the emotions."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":" 436 EMDR cognitively processes traumatic events. 478 The underlying neural mechanism of action of EMDR remains unknown. EMDR does not appear to produce the altered consciousness state associated with hypnosis. 479 EMDR may act as hemispheric synchronization. 480 The psychologist in charge of the Monroe Institute advertises EMDR as a form of hemispheric synchronization. Neurobiological models suggest EMDR increases interhemispheric communication via the corpus callosum. The most recent hypothesis is that EMDR simultaneously increases connectivity between the two he mispheres, plus within the right hemisphere. 481 482 Trauma memories are disseminated into the right hemisphere as meaningless, dissociated fragments, like pieces of a shattered mirror. The goal of EMDR is to reassemble those visual, auditory, and somatosensory fragments. Abreaction Freud coined the term abreaction to describe the release of the strong emotion associated with a repressed trauma memory. The emotion became stuck in time at the point of the original childhood trauma and is being properly processed for the first time, though abreaction. When a victim abreacts implicit trauma memories, the mind and body react as though the childhood event is presently happening. So, when I abreacted being flatlined at age 10 years, I was in danger of my heart stopping again in adulthood. EMDR pioneer Shapiro devoted a significant portion of her original clinical manual to defining and describing abreaction, and to providing guidelines for using EMDR to accommodate abreaction of repressed emotions. 483 On page 96, the author specifically addressed the inherent risks associated with reprocessing near death experiences and torture by electrocution. Shapiro described how practitioners prepared for extreme cases by having resuscitation equipment and medical staff ready. Abreaction is essential. Presently, I see no other way of processing the emotional trauma associated with extreme abuse. Yet mainstream therapy is changing the definition and therapeutic role of abreaction. One of my therapists argues that abreaction is too traumatising and has no place in the EMDR reprocessing experience. They prefer to focus on how I feel now about my childhood trauma, as an adult reflecting on the abuse, instead of at the time of the childhood abuse. This is the denial approach pushed by Antony Kidman and the APS guidelines on repressed memories. Flash EMDR was devised to address concerns about clients like me whose trauma memories are extremely intense, and who dissociate during EMDR. Flash EMDR produces favourable results in relatively minor trauma cases that involve natural dissociation and adult 478 M. Pagani et al. (2012).

It does not effectively process developmental trauma stemming from forced dissociation. Do not compare ritual abuse, trauma-based mind control, and ongoing cult and government harassment, with anything less. The intensity of repressed emotion and subsequent abreaction is proportionate to the severity of the trauma to which it is attached and must be treated accordingly. Abreaction intensity is proportionate to trauma severity . The Vortex I clearly recall the moment the vortex to my past opened. It was during an initial EMDR session. I was suddenly struck with a memory and I nearly leapt from the chair. I describe the vortex as a deep, jagged wound, shaped like the opening an old-fashioned can opener cuts into a tin can. It remained open for 1.5 years and closed the day after Richie Benaud’s death at Easter 2015. My brain informed me the moment it closed, by sending me a soft yet clear image of a thin veil of fresh flesh covering the wound. The opened vortex allowed unprecedented access to my memories and let me relive and feel the pain associated with my child abuse. During therapy, my memories usually emerged as faint visual images followed by a flood of thoughts and feelings that I experienced at the time of the abuse. I would describe what I saw, before being struck with the repressed emotion. I abreacted the emotion and felt the physical sensations as though the trauma incident were presently occurring. I relived torture, spinning, drugging, unethical hypnosis, and electrocution. I felt the pain as though the torture were happening today. I once heard a radio interview with a leading USA neurologist. He hypothesised that psychological pain registers in the brain as physical pain. The problem with nervous system pain is that others can’t see it, and therefore they are likely to dismiss its severity. My pain was akin to having one’s physical body smashed up in a car wreck and left to rot without anaesthetic for 1.5 years. When a memory began surfacing, unless it was immediately processed my symptoms would exacerbate and I became increasingly at risk. The moment I finished processing my memory via EMDR and abreacted the accompanying feelings, the symptoms dissipated, and that memory immediately ceased to bother me. The most critical times during the therapy process occurred when Gittinger’s suicide programming was activated. Outside of the vortex being opened, and my being triggered, I was not a suicide risk. I did not even contemplate the notion of harming myself. However, mind control programming is layered with commands to involuntarily suicide. Memory recovery was a violent experience that commenced with vertigo and ended with mild brain damage; it included memory loss and extreme light sensitivity. I suffered vertigo, nausea, chest pain, and cardiac dysrhythmia. The most critical 18 months of memory processing included Mengele’s Core split plus Gittinger’s attachment violation. These months took such a toll on my body, on several occasions I required physical nursing, which was non- existent. "},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":" 438 Grounding Despite being EMDR trained, my therapist knew nothing about grounding. I innately grounded myself to the present, to stop me becoming stuck or lost in the trauma memory. Visiting the past feels like dropping through a chasm in the floor , while holding someone’s hand makes me feel like I will not fall. One time when I needed to wake up out of dissociation, I told my therapist to take my hand and squeeze it very hard. Although co -conscious during therapy and aware that I am not actually back there, I’ m still at risk. I once got stuck mid- abreaction such that I looked at my therapist in terror and exclaimed, ‘Don’ t leave me here! ’ At other times, when I needed to retrieve a deeply buried memory, I ensured no-one touche d me. Hypnosis I used hypnosis long after I integrated my Core , and once I felt sufficiently stabilised. Hypnosis returned me to the state of consciousness I was in at the time of the abuse, thereby granting me unprecedented access to my hypnosis-related memories. I found it beneficial for processing deep, residual memories. My therapist combined hypnosis with EMDR, which accessed the deepest buried memories. If you could undergo hypnosis with a clean expert like Corydon Hammond, I’d say ‘go for it.’ Find Hammond’s astounding Greenbaum Speech on YouTube and consult his hypnosis handbook, 484 to gain idea of the base hypnotherapy skill and understanding required to work with ritual abuse and mind control. Review Shapiro’s comparison of EMDR versus hypnotically induced abreaction. 485 Read Secret Don’t Tell: The Encyclopedia of Hypnotism (1998) by Carla Emery, for a comprehensive overview of the history of unethical hypnosis. If a therapist does not know or agree with this reading material, move on. Voice Dialogue is part of the Hearing Voices approach that I discovered via a retired therapist who had success treating adolescent youth labelled schizophrenic (i.e., ‘traumatised’). She trained in trauma and Voice Dialogue and adapted this to working with the dissociated parts of mind control victims. I was thrilled to finally have an alternative therapy technique I could recommend to ritual abuse and mind control vict ims labelled psychotic, schizophrenic, bipolar, or personality disordered who were subsequently thrown in the ‘too hard’ basket. Psychiatry reduces everything to an illness originating in the victim, which is just another form of victim blaming. The Hearing Voices approach emerged from realising that peoples’ environmental experiences are meaningful and determine the thoughts and behaviours that psychiatrists label symptomology. It explores the person’s internal dialogue and how they make sense of the world, rather than what the DSM describes. The Voice Dialogue method recognises that the right hemisphere’s unconscious processes are more dominant than the left’s conscious, logical nature. It focuses on attachment style, which develops and continues to motiv ate behaviour at an implicit level. 484 Hammond, D.C. (1990) Handbook of Hypnotic Suggestions and Metaphors .

"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":" 439 The method is influenced by Transactional Analysis and recognises that everyone has different components of self, such as internal child part and an external parent part, that interact to cause conflict. Treatment consists of identifying these parts and their roles, and changing the relationships between parts, to facilitate emotional awareness and collaboration between the fragmented selves. When a client hears voices, that is usually an indication that a part of self has become disowned by the system and is screaming to be heard. It is easy to see how the Hearing Voices approach is readily adapted to working with a dissociative victim of ritual abuse and mind control who has multiple personalities. The goal is to dialogue with the parts that hold trauma memories, dissociated feelings, emotions and sensations. The method allows the therapist to facilitate the processing of a trauma memory held by a part, without the Core person being exposed to the trauma memory. Voice Dialogue is about changing the relationship between the Core person and their dissociated parts. It also involves negotiating between the parts so that they do not assume dominance over the Core person, so that everyone is working together. It involves recognising that each part played a crucial role in helping the Core person survive extreme trauma. Another objective is to assign each part a new meaningful role, to replace the role imposed on them by perpetrators. I intuitively engaged in the process of role reassignment by taking up Judo, classical singing, and shooting. I engaged in Voice Dialogue and used it as a therapy gap filler. I found one-hour therapy sessions insufficient; they left me dissociative and distressed, and my trauma-focussed therapist never recognised or addressed my front alters. So, after my weekly therapy session, I typically phoned my retired therapist friend who worked with me for another few hours to finish what my therapist had only just started. She would ask to speak with the alter who is aware of the trauma experience causing the symptoms, and simply ask what that alter knew. In response, I would download copious amounts of information stored in implicit memory. All someone ever had to do was ask me the right questions. ‘I’ Before ‘We’ There is a place for alter recognition, but this must be limited and purposeful. Alters are real, mini personalities with their own neural circuitry, who experienced and hold the memories of trauma. At some stage, alters and their trauma need to b e acknowledged, validated, and relieved. Therapists mainly need to know front alter names and roles. Each front alter represents a myriad of back alters, so if you win over the front alter , you cover the alters hidden behind them. My front alters were namely Soldier Alice, Intellectual Alice, Ritual Alice and Glinda . Sascha and Angel were also front alters, but more hidden. Soldier Alice protected my internal system and co-operated with Intellect Alice to manage interaction with the environment. Ritual Alice stored the implicit trauma experiences and pain in her memory circuitry and threw childish tantrums in response to trauma triggers. Glinda took a back seat after I left the cult and Kidman cursed my creative endeavours. Sascha endured the physical ar dour. Angel guarded my Core. I did not allow my parts to identify themselves or speak until long after I integrated my Core , and I refused to ever refer to myself as ‘we’ - because overindulgence in alters is"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":" 440 unhealthy and inhibits integration. All alter attention and communication should be for gaining system trust, releasing trauma memories, and encouraging cooperation and integration. Which is why I recommend victims strictly address themselves as ‘I’ instead of ‘we.’ Too many therapists seem titillated by the notion of multiple personalities; they waste precious therapy time and money familiarising themselves with, and indulging in, every alter they can possibly find. The worst example of alter overindulgence occurred at Colin Ross’ conference s where organisers provided a preschool playroom, stuffed toys, and colouring-in activities to entertain child alters. One victim’s system may contain thousands of splits, and it would take many lifetimes to get to know every alter. Instead of mapping an entire alter system, and trying to speak with every alter, effective therapy focusses on identifying and processing the trauma incidents which that created the alters in the first place. A single torture session is used to create multiple alters within the victim. Therefore, if a victim processes the memories of a single trauma incident, they will integrate up to hundreds of related alters in one go. Therapy must be Trauma-Focussed, not alter -focussed, to integrate a system. Effective therapy identifies the trauma that created the alters . Reaching the Core is Key The greatest integration shortcut of all occurs when the victim remembers the trauma incident that split their Core. As I said, instant integration occurs when a victim’s Core personality meets her splits. Victims often tell me they have no Core, that their therapist can’t locate their Core, and they ask me, ‘What is my Core?’ Your Core is the you that existed before perpetrators touched you and messed with your brain. For some, this began in utero and so the victim has no memory of their personality being intact. The Core is your soul, spirit, or consciousness - the part of you that leaves your physical body when you die or astral travel. Consciousness exists apart from the physical body, which is why mainstream scientists are currently working on ways of transferring the soul or consciousness to other physical vessels, such as cloned or synthetic forms. Thereby the wealthy elite responsible for MK -ULTRA plan to cheat death and avoid judgement. Bilateral Stimulation During the most intense phase of my memory recovery process I swam a kilometre per day, six days a week. I found swimming crucial to integration for several reasons. Freestyle lap swimming is a bilateral action which stimulates the brain hemispheres to work together. I felt swimming digested the cognitive load I experienced during a therapy session. Swimming soothed the extreme autonomic nervous system arousal that occurred during therapy, and seemingly c ountered the dangerous impact therapy had on my heart. Mid -lap one day, I was struck by an inaudible sentence, ‘You heart is regenerating.’ The laps usually felt effortless and I physically sensed the integration. An examination of left-brain Western plus bilateral Eastern conceptualisation helped me understand how and why swimming proved so essential to my integration and trauma recovery. The vagus nerve starts at the brain stem and connects to ‘mini-brains’ found in the"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":" 441 body’s major organs including the mesentery which wraps around the gut. The vagus nerve affects the heart, lungs, stomach, immune and endocrine systems. When stimulated, the vagus nerve activates the parasympathetic nervous system and calms the sympathetic system responsible for the ‘fight -flight ’ response. The vagus nerve is stimulated by touch, movement or breath, such as deep diaphragmatic breathing, prayer, exercise, laughter, massage, and cold-water immersion. Swimming covers three of these. The Chinese have long recognised the importance of the mesentery. They say the human body runs on Chi, which we know as electromagnetic energy, and the mesentery is the battery. This battery must be charged for the body to maintain energy. Caffeine is an artificial way Westerners charge the mesentery battery, while Chinese recomm end deep diaphragmatic breathing as an appropriate mesentery stimulant. I found classical singing relaxing and therapeutic because my singing teacher employed the intercostal diaphragmatic breathing technique. Typing was another bilateral activity that he lped me to cognitively digest trauma between therapy sessions. I hand wrote letters to my first two therapists, and typed emails to my last. Being a bilateral activity, typing felt more integrating than handwriting. My emails began as a simple exchange of basic information about appointment times. As my situation became critical, I began using email as a journaling process. Even if my therapist did not immediately read my emails, knowing they were immediately received was key to pain relief. I tried journaling to myself, which proved an ineffective substitute. Herbal Medicines Herbal medicines did what no drug ever could - settled my nervous system pain within one hour. You need live herbal tinctures made by an experienced herbalist, as these are far more potent than dried herbs. The Australian drug authorities and medical doctors are eliminating herbalism in Australia. There are no more courses in pure herbalism, and Australia will not recognise overseas qualifications. I completed a short course in live herbal manufacturing which taught me more in one week than students learn in a four -year naturopathy degree. Throw out your TV EEG studies show that television converts the brain from Beta to Alpha plus near Delta wave activity associated with a mild trance-like state. TV reduces our ability to verbally communicate and to think critically. It suppresses our left brain and allows information to pass unedited into our right hemisphere. This is just more brainwashing and a reinforcement of MK -ULTRA programming. Therefore, it is important for the person trying to integrate from mind control to throw out their TV. No computer games either; read David Gillespie’s book Teen Brain (2019) about the detrimental impact of screens on the developing brain to understand why. In fact, read all of Gillespie’s amazing books. He was the first person to damn refined sugar and expose its connections to obesity , heart disease and mental health. It is helpful for victims to understand how fructose switched off the part of the brain that tells us we’ re full, and that alcohol, the worst thing for neurological damage, is sugar and so has a similar effect. "},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":" 442 * * * Destroying the Matrix Writing this book served as a double-edged sword. It continually triggered my memory for my abuse, which made me violently ill, but simultaneously allowed me to access and process and integrate more sections of compartmentalised neural circuitry. While I foresaw the assassination of asset Issac Kappy, I did not anticipate his murder occurr ing at the same time as the death of my pedophile perpetrator Bob Hawke. That was a triggering combination. I entered therapy the following week too depleted to relay the weeks’ events. I positioned myself on the couch and asked my therapist to combine EMDR with hypnosis. ‘Why am I doing that?’ he asked. ‘Because you devised the technique and I think it’s a good one.’ ‘But why am I doing this today?’ ‘Because my right hemisphere always knows what it’s doing, and it wants to do this.’ ‘So, you’re going with your gut instinct?’ ‘No. The mesentery has its own mini brain, but it is the right hemisphere that processes implicitly and tells me what to do without adding the reason why. I just wrote a book chapter all about it.’ ‘How’s the book going?’ Nope. Was not going to discuss that either, as it was tied into a long week . ‘No words. Just do the therapy.’ He agreed, and soon I was dissociated enough to enter Mengele’s induction routine. I self -induced as usual, spiralled down the water channel. I surfaced in the Dagon ritual pool. Only, t his time was different. Usually there were no characters. This time there were guards at the doors which opened automatically to reveal Dagon seated on his gold throne. I bowed on one knee to the entity, placing my arms overhead in the shape of a bishop’s hat. Suddenly, I barged through the left red ritual door and marched through the rows of caged blonde children, bellowing, ‘Someday I am going to save ALL of you!’ I opened the door to Mengele’s lab beneath the US Embassy in Canberra rushed toward the Jabb a The Hut lookalike, shoved my fingers around his throat – and choked him. I exited via the blue door in the corner and began running toward the escape hatch when suddenly I detoured to a program. I took a back door to the blue, soldier programming area where countless programs were stacked to the ceiling, represented by a myriad of ancient and modern military costumes from various countries. I took a long sword and began smashing everything in sight. When that proved too time consuming, I smashed at the walls and toppled the entire room in one go . Then I realised I was Angel , wielding a samurai sword. Real pain struck my head. Not this time ! I asserted, and visualised walking through my brain and slashing open blocked pathways to allow electric current flow through. The pain instantly disappeared. Next I was hit with genuine vertigo and nausea. A gain, I pictured slashing open the closed neural circuitry. I saw the micro flesh, the multiple openings, and the flash of electric current as they opened. The vertigo disappeared immediately. Then I was assaulted with verbal thought loops.

I was replicating the visualisation technique that Mengele used to create the neural pathways and programs in the first place. Finally, I climbed up Mengele’s blue soldier room and emerged through a vent onto the manicured lawn of the US Embassy. ‘When you’re ready,’ my therapist droned. I described the carnage. ‘It’s like the final scene of The Matrix. I can destroy their programming because this is in my brain and I can do as I like. I am taking control.’ * * * "},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":" 444 Dirty Doctors People are bastard-coated bastards with bastard filling. – Scrubs (Ep. 407) Fundamentally, your chosen therapist must not be a network operative. I have communicated with countless child abuse survivors including victims of ritual abuse and mind control. Their testimonies plus my own experience formed my conclusion that most therapists are either perpetrators or being handled by perpetrators. Dodging dirty doctors is a trial and error process. It is important for vulnerable victims to not trust therapists just because they are high profile , lecture at seminars on trauma and dissociation, and write books on DID and MK- ULTRA. These are all CIA operatives. Think about it: the clean ones, like Corydon Hammond who presented the famous Greenbaum Speech , invariably get death threats and are quickly and permanently forced out of the industry. I will now detail my personal experience of two Canadians therapists considered experts in ritual abuse, mind control and DID, to drive home my point: Trust no-one. Colin Ross George Bergen compiled a massive dossier of evidence against Colin Ross including copies of signed affidavits. 486 While I do not agree victims should follow Bergen’s concluding recommendation to consult CIA doctor Richard Ofshe, his evidence is relevant to my experience of Colin Ross. Here is a summary of the dossier content: From 1985 to 1991, Canadian psychiatrist Colin A. Ross worked at the St. Boniface General Hospital, University of Manitoba. He employed suggestive questioning, hypnosis, and age regression, and commonly prescribed overdoses of Halcion (triazolam) and sodium amytal injections. Ross also performed experimental drug testing on patients for large Drug Corporations. Roma Elizabeth Hart was a patient of Colin Ross from 1986 to 1991. In a 1998 signed affidavit, Hart testified that all of Ross' MPD patients at St Boniface Hospital became suicidal, and that Ross encouraged his drug-induced patients to commit suicide. Hart named the 1991 death of Wanda Davenport as one of five wrongful deaths Ross caused at the hospital. Colin Ross was dismissed from his position at St. Boniface General Hospital in 1991 for causing the wrongful deaths of five patients. This dismissal was covered up, permitting Ross to register in Texas. In July 1998, Texan authorities charged Colin A. Ross with fraud, gross negligence, fraudulent concealment, and conspiracy to commit fraud. Charges were also filed against Ross in the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench in 1994 and 1997. Numerous complaints against Colin Ross were submitted to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba, Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, Royal College of Physicians of Canada, and Canadian Psychiatric Association. I was aware of Colin Ross’ background when I agreed to present at a 2016 Trauma and Dissociation conference at the Radisson hotel in Seattle, and I knew that Ross was speaking at the conference . I did not know that Colin Ross sponsored the event. His ownership of the 486 George Bergen (1998). Evidence Against Dr Colin A. Ross, Vol.1 . [archive.org]"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":" 445 conference explained why it amounted to a marketing opportunity for therapists. Speakers who paid to attend and be heard were rewarded with stalls inside the hotel from which they peddled cards, stickers, $45 books and fridge magnets to vulnerable DID victims. It also explained why the Seattle conference also served as an advertisement for Colin Ross’ Institute where clients entered non-suicidal and left in a box. It is normal for conference organisers to send speakers (especially international ones) a contract outlining what is required of the speaker and what is being provided to the speaker. This was promised but never delivered to me. Originally, I was told that my presentation was going to be professionally filmed. This never occurred either . I was also promised a plenary speaking session first thing Friday morning when the conference began. Plenary means speaking in the main, large room with no other competing sessions. Colin Ross’ daughter Dana was given my spot instead. Victims and I had not heard of her. The conference organisers hid me away in a tiny room at the end of a hall. The conference schedule was formatted such that it prevented people from finding me. Some attendees could not find me at all because my biography and presentation synopsis were missing from their folders. All folders were individually named, so in theory organisers could control who did and did not know I was speaking. Even when my information was in the folder, it was well buried. Technical set-up of the conference rooms occurred on the Thursday. I was scheduled to speak early the following morning. Come Thursday evening, my room was not set up; i t had no podium, no projector, no microphone, no computer, no cables, and no technical support. I could not deliver my presentation without basic equipment. I approached the conference organiser and asked why my room was not set up. She alleged she had specifically instructed the technician to do so, and to go phone him. Being Australian and having just arrived in the USA, I had no phone. I eventually found the technician who told me the conference organiser never instructed him to set up my room. Meanwhile , the other speakers, aware of my plight, openly boasted of how glad they were that their rooms were set up for the next morning . Most of them accompanied Colin Ross to a posh seafood dinner at Seattle’s famous fisherman’s wharf. I was not invited. Besides , I was too busy trying to remedy the deficiencies of the conference organiser. I approached the senior Radisson hotel staff member assigned to the conference and requested a spare podium. The man contemptuously told me Radisson did not have another podium , pointed to a 50cm high coffee table , and spat, ‘Use that!’ Thirty minutes remained before the Radisson locked the ir conference rooms for the evening. It was time to show the Yanks what Australians are famous for. I stole the essential equipment from another conference room belonging to the woman feeding her face with lobster after boasting the loudest about how pleased she was that her room was prepared. I demanded the conference organiser help me carry the equipment to my speaking room. Radisson staff locked the speaking rooms for the night. I retired to my room for a delivered burger and crap American TV. The following morning, I quietly smiled to myself as the hotel foyer echoed a woman’s hysterical cries: ‘WHERE’S MY PODIUM?!’ Oddly enough, Radisson staff immediately found that speaker a spare podium."},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":" 446 I delivered my talk to a keen audience which doubled in size once word got out about who and where I was. Following my two-hour presentation, a victim encountered her own therapist in the hall who exclaimed, ‘I am so angry at Fiona’s talk! I am so angry that no one has ever told me that information before!’ Several victims voiced how angry they were for having made no progress following 20 years of therapy. My second conference session was an opportunity for the audience to ask me questions. I commenced this with a scathing attack on the conference . ‘How are all those books and stickers helping you?’ I challenged them. ‘ How far along the healing path are you? Some of you have been in therapy twenty years and got nowhere! Why?’ After this, one therapist pulled me to the conference organiser in the foyer and practically shouted at her , ‘Why wasn’t Fiona in the main room?! She should have been a main speaker! She’s amazing! What she said was amazing!’ Multiple attendees asked me to write the content of my presentation down, asked for my book, asked me to write a book, asked me when my book was being released. I had no book, I told them, nor any intention of writing one. Another therapist approached me and said that her client, who was not suicidal, ‘committed suicide’ at Colin Ross’ Institute. It should be impossible to commit suicide in such a facility . That is the point of a hospital for potentially suicidal DID clients. ‘Do you trust Colin Ross?’ I asked. ‘I don’t know...’ she responded tearfully. Only two fellow speakers introduced themselves to me over the entire four days. Most speakers glared or stared oddly at me and the victims who flocked to speak with me. My attendance had been used to market the conference and draw victims from all over, including Las Vegas, who came specifically to see me. The true reason for inviting me to the USA came next: Alaska. Alison Miller A Tacoma Police social worker lured me to Alaska under the guise of assisting with a two-week intensive intervention with an alleged DID client. My assistant, Nicky , had been harping on about visiting Alaska, so the decision to go seemed an obvious way of pleasing her. So, I swapped my plans to visit my family in Canada, for Autumn in Alaska. Nicky and I travelled to Anchorage at our own expense. Canadian psychologist Alison Miller was the DID expert supervisor in this case. Nicky and I were placed on a roster of volunteers who ‘baby-sat’ the client at night. We were collected from the airport in Anchorage by social worker Kimber Olson who drove us to a remote cottage in Eagle River Valley. Nicky and I were not briefed or given a chance to speak alone with Kimber, prior to being left alone with the client named Sarah. In fact, we never got to speak with Kimber about the client. At the cottage, Kimber told Nicky and I (again, in front of the client) that Sarah was prone to self-harming by cutting. Kimber placed four rolls of cloth bandages on the table and told us what to do in the likely event Sarah cut herself. W e were to bandage Sarah’s wounds but not contact the hospital or the police because both departments contained members of the offending cult who ritually abused the client. The large collection of kitchen knives, and the hunting knife sitting in one of the cottage bedrooms also struck me as counterproductive."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":" 447 Kimber did not remove these in preparation for Sarah’s stay, nor did she suggest they be removed. Nicky later removed and hid them of her own volition. Nicky and I had no transport. The cottage had no cell phone reception. It did have a landline and internet access. Kimber said she would phone us with the internet password. She instructed me to provide the internet password to Sarah who worked in IT at a local University. Her being allowed computer access seemed to contradict the expressed goal of isolating the client from her alleged cult perpetrators. Kimber also permitted the client to go out with a friend (her former therapist) one evening , which also seemed counterproductive to severing external contact. Why, then, are we in a cabin in the middle of nowhere? I wondered. Yep, t hat is the point where I should have returned to Anchorage for some halibut and home-brewed root beer. But then I would not have the following awesome story, or dirt on Alison Miller. The Eagle River cottage was situated in wild bear and moose territory where, I was later told, r esidents had been attacked while simply taking out their trash. Nicky and I were not warned of the potential risk associated with man-eating wildlife. I specifically asked whether it was safe for us to hike, whether there were bears, and whether I needed bear mace. I was told we were safe from bears and did not need mace . It was akin to my assuring visiting Alaskans it’s safe to swim in the Aussie ocean at night. So, the following day, Nicky and I went hiking on a nearby trail. The next day, I hiked for four hours to the top of a nearby mountain. . . alone. I noticed fresh berry-flavoured bear scat all over. Wide-eyed locals later told me I certainly was at risk of being attacked by a bear - or even a moose, and that the safest thing to do was make a lot of noise as you hike, to scare off the bears. I inadvertently did this. Knowing I was trapped in a setup, I began dialoguing with God out aloud during my solo hike . I was on a remote mountain in the middle of Alaska with no-one to call me nuts. So, I went for it, voiced my anger aloud. ‘Meet me at the top of that mountain!’ I shouted at the sky. ‘Come down and have it out with me, face to face!’ Every time I reached what I thought was the peak , my shoulders slumped at realising it was another optical illusion behind which the genuine peak teasingly sat. I repeatedly fell for the same deception. I pressed on, pointing at what must be the actual peak, and yelling at God like a lunatic, ‘Meet me at the top of that mountain!’ Eventually , I reached the top. I was metres from the tip, and breathless, when something big, black and silent blocked out the blue sky. It buzzed directly over my head. Once it passed me, I hear d the familiar hum of chopper blades. My gut dropped. Oh no! A black helicopter – the type you only read about on conspiracy websites. The mechanical beast stopped nearby, turned sideways to me, and just hovered there , looking at me . They got me ! I’m dead! I surveyed the scene for fresh ideas, knowing I was trapped. There was nowhere to hide. A dozen excuses for my death flashed through my mind - Stupid Aussie tourist fell off remote mountain during loan hike... Suddenly, the took off toward Anchorage. I lifted my tablet and began filming its departure. Once it was out of sight, I looked around for somewhere to shelter. There was nothing except a small cleft in one side of the mountain top. I pressed myself against the cleft while I gathered myself."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":" 448 The sound of chopper blades returned. I stretched my head around the corner to see a green army helicopter with a long thin gun on its nose. The craft travelled up the valley a little further, before turning around and returning to base. That’s more normal , I sighed with relief, but filmed it anyhow. Then I started my decent . It was getting late and the Alaskan freez e would soon set in. That evening, I watched in wonderment as my dissociated right brain had a little chat with the CIA asset we were babysitting. I smiled sweetly and warned Sarah: ‘I’ m confident my training more than equips me for whatever you think you have planned.’ Nicky and had already endured two sleepless night when the asset descended the stairs at 1am. She growled ‘cunt’ at me, turned off all the lights, and chanted : ‘The shedding of blood for the atonement of sins.’ Sarah entered the kitchen, pulled a large 40cm that she pre -planted in a drawer, and pointed this at Nicky who stood nearby. I approached, and Sarah began waved the knife back and forth between Nicky and me . Then I stepped between Nicky and the psycho. ‘Drop the knife !’ I demanded while mentally preparing to grab the nearby chair and smash it over her head. Sarah froze. The knife fell from her raised hand. I switched on the light. I spent the night chatting with Sarah in the lounge room. I also emailed Kimber Olson and relayed what had just occurred. The following morning, I phoned Kimber Olson . During our conversation, Kimber told me she had expected something like the knife incident to occur . She said Alison Miller had advised her not to spend the night with the client, and in her next breath she asked me to babysit Sarah alone in the cabin for one more night. Kimber acted surprised when I declined. I asked Kimber for Alison Miller’s phone number. I phoned Alison who played down the knife incident, concluding the client would likely have used the knife on herself instead of us. I disagreed, as did the Seattle homicide detective I described the experience to, who pointed out the obvious clue - the knife was aimed at Nicky and I, not Sarah. Alison Miller also expected Nicky and I to babysit Sarah another night. I emailed Kimber Olsen and told her Nicky and I were at risk and would leav e with her as soon as possible. Kimber emailed me and said she would be collecting the client, and that Nicky and I may as wel l stay at the cottage another night. The set-up had become ridiculously obvious . Kimber repeatedly asked me whether I was going to inform the aggressive knife - wielding asset that we were leaving. I refused. Despite the critical incident, Kimber delayed collecting Nicky and I until the following evening . This was disturbing because during the day, the client became increasingly agitated and aggressive toward us. S arah berated me for speaking with Alison Miller about her. I responded, ‘Pulling a knife on us was a game changer .’ When Kimber Olson arrived, I asked to speak with her alone. She pulled a mocking face as though my request was strange, amusing even. During this conversation, Kimber said she had a bad gut feeling about staying overnight with the client. Kimber then informed us she would drop Nicky and I off at a hotel before taking the client back to her office for therapy. I did not want the client (or Kimber) knowing where we were staying, so I asked if we could instead use the internet at Kimber’s office block to locate a hotel. But Kimber dumped me and Nicky in the carpark outside her office block and made it clear we were not welcome"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":" 449 inside to use her internet. It was dusk, below freez ing, and we had no means of finding a hotel in Anchorage’s commercial district before sunset . We began walking. The following day, I presented to a group of therapists who were undergoing training in trauma and dissociation under Kimber Olson. The talk was well received. ‘How long have you been speaking at conferences?’ They asked me during question time. ‘This is my first time.’ ‘Really? You wouldn’t know it. Tell people three years!’ they insisted. I laughed. Two experienced psychiatric workers spent the next few days showing us some well appreciated Alaskan hospitality. They fed us home -caught halibut and chartered a private boat to tour the glaciers. I wondered to the health professionals whether things were ‘done a little differently in Alaska.’ ‘No,’ the horrified professionals informed me . Their colleague had severely breached Alaska’s ethical standards and protocols. The two women continually checked whether Kimber Olsen had contacted us yet. Nicky started showing signs of a trauma response , and the usual protocol was to debrief victims of a critical incident. Yet Kimber never even asked us asked us what happened, and never contacted us again. So, upon returning to Seattle, I arranged for the Tacoma Police Social Worker to take us to debrief with Alison Miller in nearby Canada. Miller agreed to this arrangement but cancelled at the last minute for unconvincing reasons. Alison Miller never communicate d with us again. * * * When I returned home to Australia, I relayed my Alaskan adventure to former Special Forces soldier , Tim Roy. I did not say what I thought the black helicopter was. I simply relayed the details and then asked for Tim’s opinion. ‘Fiona, ’ Tim said, ‘ that black helicopter was exactly what you thought it was.’ I knew the helicopter intended to pick me up on that mountain top. I knew the moment its back belly passed over me . I knew it from its peculiar movements, the way it seemed to baulk and reconsider. What stopped it from picking me up? I puzzled - until it dawned on me. When the helicopter ’s occupants looked down at me, they did not see a lone figure atop that mountain. They saw someone with me. God had met me at the top of the mountain after all. * * * ‘Do you know Michael Salter,’ the Alaskan therapists questioned me after my presentation. ‘Never heard of him before the Seattle conference ,’ I responded. The Tacoma Police social worker had shown me some texts between her and Salter that I found irritating. Fellow Australian Michael Salter presented on DID in Seattle and Alaska in 2015 and said the opposite to what I said: that the Australian government has never been"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":" 450 involved in organised child abuse, ritual abuse or mind control, and that his studies concluded this type of abuse was non-existent. ‘I will deal with Michael Salter when I return to Australia .’ Michael Salter describes himself a s an ‘expert’ in ‘complex trauma,’ ‘organised child abuse, ’ ‘complex forms of victimisation including organised abuse and technologically - facilitated abuse .’ Salter wrote articles with titles like, ‘ Why does it take victims of child sex abuse so long to speak up?’ and co-authored an article on DID with Warrick Middleton (who said ritual abuse is a ‘metaphor for incest’). Michael Salter sits on the ISSTD ( International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation ) Board of Directors, and he is an Associate Editor of Child Abuse Review (journal of the British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect). He previously sat on the Blue Knot Foundation Board of Directors (the organisation Tim Roy says sabotaged his case against VIP perpetrators by refusing to hand police copies of his evidence.) I phoned Michael Salter on 11 April 2018, and introduced myself, ‘Hi Michael, this is Fiona Barnett. I’m writing a book and I called you to clarify something. I spoke on trauma and dissociation in America, and the therapists I spoke with in Seattle and Alaska said they heard you speak previously, and that you told them there was no government involvement in ritual abuse and mind control in Australia. Is that right?’ Salter : ‘I think they’re referring to 2015 when I spoke on organised and ritual abuse. I talked about my research with forty or so survivors who, when describing electro-shock and other methods, did not do so in connection to the Australian military. It’s a different situation to the US where there have been credible, consistent reports. Colin Ross has obtained evidence under FOI. We always have a challenge when allegations are not documented, when we go public with some things we think we know but can’t prove. The trauma industry has suffered from people going public and making public claims about people and organisations which they couldn’t prove. There is a need for evidence more than survivor testimony.’ Me: ‘You say there’s no evidence of CIA mind control in Australia. What about MK - ULTRA Subproject 84 that was conducted at Sydney University in 1960 under the supervision of Martin Orne? Orne and Evans subsequently published an article about that research in a major journal. MK-ULTRA research was conducted at every major Australian university.’ Salter: ‘A few subproject names thrown about. That’s just hear say. That proves nothing.’ Me: ‘In their published articles, these people acknowledge that their research was financed by the Human Ecology Fund - which was a CIA cut-out for funding MK -ULTRA research, as recorded in the US Library of Congress. That’s called a paper trail! I’m in contact with James Rothstein who was appointed to the first taskforce in the US to investigate organised pedophilia. He discovered a VIP pedophile ring that went all the way to the Whitehouse. He said Watergate solely concerned trying to obtain VIP pedophile records being held at Democratic headquarters. He said they discovered an identical pedophile ring in Australia that involved Australian prime ministers, and he is placing me in touch with Australians who worked on this same ring. He said that every time he got somewhere, arrested or charged a VIP, it was shut down under national security. He said every cop who took this above street level was shut down. The same thing happens in Australia. That’s exactly what happened to Reina Michaelson when she tried to expose this in Victoria.’"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":" 451 Salter raised his voice, ‘I had a lot to do with that case and that is not what happened.’ Me: ‘I know all about that case too. Reina told me that she was placed under something she called a D-notice , and when I saw her in Sydney, she said she was under surveillance by ASIO.’ Salter: ‘This is an area that puts people under a lot of pressure, causing them to become paranoid. Reina talked about electronic weapons and people following her...’ Me: ‘You mentioned Colin Ross. I spoke at his conference, only I didn’t know it was his conference because that was hidden. When I was there, a therapist approached me and told me her client suspiciously died in Colin Ross’ clinic. Then a retired detective told me he researched Colin Ross and found out he had a dubious background including being fired from a hospital for ethical breaches and having a disproportionate number of patients die in his care. Then victims complained to me that Ross mocked them during his conference presentation.’ Salter: ‘Colin Ross is a weird dude! He’s just weird! A lot of paranoia often arises in this field. Everybody currently working in this field is accused of being a perpetrator. That’s the first accusation made. I’ve even been accused. Avoid exaggeration. We must be careful what we take public, what we can’t prove.’ Me: ‘What constitutes evidence?’ Salter: ‘What are we proving? We can use victim testimony to prove that people are using electrodes.’ Me: ‘So, you say you interviewed forty victims and concluded solely from their witness testimony that ritual abuse and mind control exist. Yet you dismiss the testimonies of victims who witnessed government organised child trafficking. What’s the difference? How can you believe one witness testimony but not another?’ Salter: ‘It’s a big jump from making general claims to saying agencies are involved. Stepping forward with the VIP story gets us nowhere without the evidence. One reason perpetrators get away with it, is because the public don’t know the basics. The basic process of education is needed because people are stuck in a conspiracy mindset. Ninety -nine percent of professionals are good people. Most of my students want to become police officers. Police need to be trained in how to interview DID victims.’ Me: ‘That’s not the problem.’ Salter: ‘Yes, it is! Police need to recognise what to do when a victim starts switching mid-interview.’ Me: ‘I attended police interviews after I had integrated. The cop who took my statements was clean. But I was cold called by a lawyer who told me the cop above the one who took my statements, the one in charge of my investigation, was involved in the child trafficking network. Sure enough, she stopped my case. A lack of training may be a contributing factor, and it may be a tactic employed to prevent victims being helped, but the main problem is getting police to take our statements in the first place. Victims like me never get anywhere in the first place.’ Salter: ‘I interviewed fifty survivors of severe abuse including ritual abuse, and many of them made statements and some saw their perpetrators convicted.’ Me: Oh, fifty now? ‘You must be dealing with a different population.

Proving anything from thirty years ago is almost impossible.’ Me: ‘That reminds me of the Royal Commission who told me to my face that they had no intention of helping current victims, that they exist to help future victims. My response to that is - current victims are the future.’ Salter: ‘There is no organised child trafficking network. It’s like drugs, lots of people and small groups all over the place deal in drugs; it’s the same with pedophiles. There is no organised criminal hierarchy trafficking children.’ Me: ‘There is a hierarchy - because I witnessed it. So, you’re saying victims shouldn’t bother reporting historical crimes?’ Salter: ‘I’m not adv ising anyone to do anything.’ Me: ‘I put in a historical complaint to the health board against Antony Kidman. He was dead within a month of my notification. His security team told the press that he was immediately placed on suicide watch following my compl aint. See, I was not the first to complain about him.’ Salter: ‘That’s great!’ Me: ‘The Daruk boys’ home is currently under investigation because of my efforts. I pursued that matter, publicised it and harassed the police until they had to investigate. ’ Salter: ‘That’s great!’ Me: ‘My winning tactic was to come from a position of experience where I knew that I was dealing with a criminal hierarchy. And I achieved that outcome through what I published on my websites and YouTube. You say victims of organised pedophilia should not make police statements and should not publish our witness testimonies online. So, what you are effectively saying is - victims like me should not have a voice. I went and made police witness statements knowing they would go nowhere, b ecause it was healing. Ask any genuine victim and they will tell you the most important thing to them is justice. All victims have a right to justice.’ Salter: ‘We have a different standard regarding the public domain and publishing what you are unable to prove. Like, saying that you have different brain structure , reduces your credibility.’ Me: ‘Sorry?’ I asked incredulously, ‘Are you talking about the scientific research published in peer edited journals, in which functional MRi scans show that both brain hemispheres light up when high IQ people perform cognitive tasks, as opposed to when someone with an average IQ performs the same tasks, only the left hemisphere is activated?’ Salter snidely repeated, ‘Saying that you have different brain structure reduc es your credibility.’ Me: ‘Are you familiar with the work of Linda Silverman, with the research I studied in gifted education and psychology?’"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":" 453 Salter: ‘When you say something that contradicts history, you lose credibility. When you say Whitlam and Kerr, wh o were arch enemies, were in a homosexual relationship, you lose credibility.’ Me: ‘Firstly, a mainstream journalist wrote an article saying exactly that.’ Salter: ‘A dodgy journalist.’ Me: ‘Secondly, I witnessed them having sex at a pedophile orgy at Parliament House, along with many other men from opposing political parties. Their public façades have nothing to with how these politicians act behind closed doors. And, who appointed John Kerr to the position of Governor General in the first place? Gough Whitlam did, against the better judgement of his party. So, Whitlam and Kerr certainly were not enemies at that time, were they. I spoke with a journalist who wrote favourable articles about me. He said he once spoke to a couple of spooks who told him that all senior politicians are pedophiles because that is how they are controlled, and he asked me if that was my experience. Do you know David Donovan who edits the Independent Australia journal that I wrote articles for?’ Salter: ‘I know of him.’ Me: ‘There’s a reason he believed my story. Do you know the film Muriel’s Wedding?’ Salter: ‘Yes.’ Me: ‘That film is mostly based on a true story that occurred in my local area. The character in the movie called Diedre Chambers is based on a real-life woman who ran a local post office with her husband; they had twin boys. David Donovan met one of the twins when he came to pest-control his house. When he realised David was a journalist, he said he had a story for him. When this twin was young, local mayor Tom Hogan (fil m-maker P.J.

Michael, I just think that when you tell people at conferences that you interviewed forty or fifty victims , and because they didn’t say anything about government involvement, you conclude there’s no evidence of government involvement - I think you’re better off saying nothing at all, otherwise you are only discrediting victims like me.’ Pause. Salter: ‘Sorry to cut this short, but I have to get some work done. And sorry things got a little heated at the end.’ Me: ‘That’s okay. This has been a very prod uctive conversation. You have just shown me the weaknesses in my story that I must address. You have shown me the exact direction in which I need to take my book. Thank you for that, Michael.’ Salter: ‘Oh, err...okay. Goodbye.’ ‘Bye.’ I phoned the USA to bitch about Mr Salter with David Shurter who concluded, ‘You’ve been triggered because he just spoke to you the way our perpetrators did.’ Then I bitched to James Shanahan who told me Salter was a gay lawyer, and that he was one of the ‘40 to 50’ victims Salter interviewed for his PhD.

In the first of a two-part update, pedophile ring survivor Fiona Barnett shares her experiences since testifying before the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse, including involvement in a documentary, the discove ry of key abusers and her ongoing fight to have authorities investigate her allegations. I left my 2013 Royal Commission hearing with dashed hopes and a reignited need for trauma counselling. So, I applied for counselling through NSW Victim Services, who allocated a psychologist at Living Well Psychology and Counselling. Following my initial consultation and the disclosure of my Royal Commission statement, the psychologist wrote in a report to Victim Services that police investigated me for murdering the relative who abused me as a child — my step-grandfather and Nazi war criminal Peter Holowczak. (This pedophile actually committed suicide in Sydney whilst I was residing in Brisbane.) The psychologist’s bizarre allegation contradicted everything I said during our initial meeting, plus the content of the Royal Commission statement I had shared. My subsequent complaint resulted in the psychologist appearing before a professional conduct panel. NSW Victim Services subsequently approved a replacement psychologist. Soon after commencing therapy with me, my new therapist was allegedly stalked by thugs who followed her home one night from her clinic to her remote property and circled her car. Saunders consequently provided a formal witness statement about the incident to Detective Terry Frost of the Tweed Heads police. The same men simultaneously stalked my two friends who also reported their experiences to police. The thugs then tailgated me to my daughter’s primary school, but I cut their car off and photographed its number plate. I was again stalked and tailgated on the day of perpetrator Antony Kidman’s funeral (see pictures above right). Journalist Jonica Bray, accompanied by a photographer and makeup artists, visited my home to interview me for a potential Woman’s Day magazine story. This team and my family witnessed, photographed and spoke with the two me n who allegedly admitted they had been hired to ‘ keep an eye on’ me. Since my 2013 hearing, I have fought to make formal witness statements to police. In May 2014, my husband accompanied me to Tweed Heads police station where I spent two days detailing multiple crimes of child sex trafficking, abduction, rape and murder. Detective Terry Frost omitted many crimes involving perpetrators known to have since died. He concluded that while he found my allegations ‘left field, ’ there were numerous unsolved"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":" 456 historical murders in the locations I identified. He said he would immediately send my statements to Sutherland Shire police. Prior to making these statements, I had spent a year reliving my childhood abuse with my psychologist. The incidents of crime were so numerous and the therapy process so gruelling, my physical health was severely impacted. To illustrate, the therapy triggered vertigo and heart problems. On one occasion, these symptoms struck me in the surf and I nearly drowned. Consequently, my therapist was reluctant to work with my memories. This slowed the process down, so that by the time the precious opportunity to make witness statements with Detective Terry Frost arose, I had not finished processing everything. So I avoided addressing many crimes duri ng my initial statement making, aware of my legal right to include them later under my allocated event number: 54671514. My subsequent attempts to report the remaining crimes were thwarted. My emails and phone calls to police were stonewalled for a year. Further, in contravention of my legal rights as a victim of crime, NSW police did not inform me of the progress of the statements I had made. On 6 March 2015, I wrote to the NSW Police Commissioner and requested a chance to complete my witness statements. The Sex Crimes Squad replied on the Commissioner’s behalf, informing me that my initial statements were now with Sutherland Shire detectives. Also in March 2015, I contacted the Federal Police regarding the crimes I experienced in Canberra — including being prostituted under the name ‘Candy Girl’ to Parliament House and to an international political leader in the back of a military airplane at Fairbairn Airport. My communication was ignored until I appealed to the Federal Police Commissioner. An Operation Attest officer named Louise Hawke contacted me and requested I email her details of my abuse. I did this and attached numerous crime scene illustrations. The officer subsequently phoned me and said that, while she believed my account, the historical nature of my complaints made them too difficult to prosecute. Officer Hawke assured me my information had been placed on file for future reference and referred me to ACT Victim Services, who said I qualified for counselling services but not compensation, because t he ACT crimes committed against me had occurred prior to their 1985 cut-off date. Last July, Australia’s 60 Minutes aired a story about a Westminster pedophile ring titled, Spies, Lords and Predators. I was abused by an Australian equivalent of that UK ring, yet there are notable differences. I was trafficked to international VIPs both within Australia and overseas. This ring involved elements of the Australian military. My perpetrators operated in close collaboration with the USA government and they employ ed sophisticated methods for keeping their operation hidden. Following the airing of their UK story, 60 Minutes were inundated with phone calls from Australian pedophile ring victims. A leading child abuse advocacy centre nominated me to 60 Minutes who are now working on an Australian version of their UK ring story. 60 Minutes told me they had narrowed their list of Australian victims to 30 possible interviewees. So, somewhere out there sit 29 alleged fellow victims of the same Australian VIP pedophile ring that abused me. I urge those potential interviewees to contact me via IA. It would be nice to have my memories validated by another human, instead of being constantly bashed by ignorance and denial."},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":" 457 As requested, I sent 60 Minutes reporter Ross Coulthart the information I had so far supplied state and federal police. Whilst interviewing my friends and associates, Coulthart questioned the validity of my testimony. He described my memory of being assaulted by a USA politician in the back of a USA military plane at an Australian military airport as far- fetched. Just what do people think international child trafficking looks like? If it is documented that the USA military and CIA have been involved in drugs and arms trafficking, would child trafficking be a phy sical or moral impossibility for these same people? Ross Coulthart also questioned my memory that a Governor -General raped me during a pedophile orgy at Parliament House, based on something that all journalists apparently knew — that this married man was a closet homosexual. Such a conclusion ignores the nature of perpetrators’ perverted fetishes and the various reasons why VIPs assault children. Within the context of the crime ring I witnessed, homosexuality, heterosexuality, paedophilia, bestiality and ne crophilia were not mutually exclusive. Perpetrators did not always engage in these activities out of personal desire or preference, but rather as a means of exerting power and humiliating their victims. This year, an independent documentary team began rese arching my child abuse experiences. These producers quickly found ample evidence to support my allegations. They discovered the identity of the man my siblings and I were instructed to call ‘Dr Mark. ’ Leonas Petrauskas was the adopted son of a Lithuanian opera star, and he played basketball for Lithuania. (My Nazi war criminal grandmother was Lithuanian and friends with Petrauskas.) Petrauskas owned and worked at the Engadine Medical Centre on the corner of Boronia Ave and Old Princess Highway. The documentary team obtained copies of Petrauskas’ family photo albums, passports and Nazi papers. These documents show he was the Nazi doctor who matched the description of him I have been supplying to institutions for 25 years. Dr Petrasukas’ crimes were so numerou s, evidence of them erupted wherever we looked — and even where we didn't. During the documentary excursion, I approached a couple in the Engadine McDonalds' car park and asked them for directions. Within minutes, the woman told me she was another victim of Dr Petrauskas, who referred her for deep sleep treatment with Harry Bailey at the notorious Chelmsford private hospital, which has reported links to Dr Ewan Cameron’s unethical electroshock experiments in Canada. Dr Petrauskas attended Sydney University at the same time as another key perpetrator, Dr Antony Kidman. The documentary team located Antony Kidman’s former North Sydney home at 16 William Edward St, Longueville. This matched the description I provided the NSW Psychology Board in my complaint against him. Via realestate.com, I recognised the lounge room and pool in which I was sexually assaulted by Kidman and his famous stage actor friend who is still alive. The assault occurred during a post-production party held at Kidman’s house. My researchers located and interviewed another perpetrator — a woman who assisted Dr Petrauskas while he performed an abortion on me. I witnessed this same woman lure, drug and murder a young male surfer at a remote Kurnell beach. If that is the type of information amateurs found in their spare time using a $60 internet connection, imagine what the NSW Police could achieve."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":" 458 My documentary producer contacted the NSW Police media liaison officer and asked why police refused to take my remaining witness statements. The Det ective who took my initial statements immediately contacted me and said he would not take my remaining statements until he had heard what Sutherland Police were doing regarding my initial statements. I argued that I had far more information to add to the content of my original statements. The detective finally directed me to travel to Sydney to complete my witness statements there. Consequently, I approached a Sydney officer I trust and offered to attend Police Headquarters at my own expense. I am currently liaising with a Sutherland detective and have made tentative arrangements to meet her at Police Headquarters next month to finish my witness statements. I hope this occurs and that I can achieve some kind of closure to my child abuse history. Upon finding the identity of Leonas Petrauskas, as well as another offending medical doctor who is still alive, I contacted the NSW Coroner and suggested he investigate every birth and death certificate these doctors ever signed. I said I had witnessed Dr Petrauskas f abricate medical documentation to cover for crimes including murders. The NSW Coroner said he could not conduct such an investigation without the direction of the NSW Police. So I forwarded the NSW Coroner’s response to the NSW Police Commissioner, asking him to direct the coroner to investigate my allegations. The Commissioner thanked me in writing for supplying the information and assured me it had been forwarded to the appropriate designation. ‘What, the paper shredder?! ’ quipped my current Victim Services counsellor. The corroborative evidence that my documentary makers continue to find in support of my allegations has been offered to the authorities. If the authorities are not interested in this evidence, perhaps the public is. My documentary, Candy Girl, is at the editing stage. * * * FIONA BARNETT: THE CANDY GIRL, THE ROYAL COMMISSION & THE NSW POLICE Fiona Barnett, Independent Australia , 23 October 2015. In the second part of her update, Fiona Barnett details the shocking mistreatment she has endured from certain NSW Police – and others – since testifying to the Child Abuse Royal Commission about her experiences as a victim of an international child sex trafficking ring. The Child Abuse Royal Commission has invested government dollars in an initiative called 'Message to Australia': ...an opportunity for the people who have bravely told their stories to the Royal Commission to send a short message to the Australian community about their experience and their hopes for creating a safer environment for children in the future. Select victim messages will be published and stored in the public library — under ‘BS.’ If my message were selected for inclusion, it would read:"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":" 459 Don’t come forward as I have done! Don’t place your trust in investigative bodies, police and therapists. It’s not worth the risk to you and your family. If you insist on attending professional counselling, do so under a pseudonym and pay cash. Here’s why: At my 2013 hearing, I made some reasonable requ ests: witness protection, a chance to provide my testimony to police and for police to investigate my allegations. Two years on, I am still waiting for these requests to be fulfilled. I have not heard from my Royal Commission case manager since March 2014 when I provided her with additional information. Instead, I have experienced an increase in police indifference and harassment. Certain NSW Police dismissed my witness testimony against a VIP pedophile ring as unworthy of collection and investigation. Howe ver, they simultaneously used the witness statements I provided them as grounds for suspending my pistol licence. On 24 December 2014, its Firearms Registry gave me two days to surrender my licence or face possible criminal charges. Their deadline counted Christmas and Boxing Day as working days. It appears that Tweed Heads Police sent my witness statements to the state Firearms Registry (located in nearby Murwillumbah) instead of to Sutherland Shire detectives. When I confronted the detective with whom I made my statements about this action, he exclaimed: ‘I didn’t do that!’ I told Detective Terry Frost I knew he was innocent. During a recent conversation with the Sutherland detective inspector in charge of my case, I was informed that she only re cently requested my statements from Tweed Heads Police and that she has not yet read them. I heard from the Firearms Registry months before NSW Police told me whether my witness statements were in the hands of Sydney detectives, or if my allegations were b eing investigated. Bettina Walker, manager of the NSW Police Firearms Registry, informed me that she had served 20 years as a police officer and: ‘I know from experience the content of your statements is true.’ She said that I must undergo a psychiatric ev aluation, based on my statement content, to determine whether I was a risk to myself or the public because of the crimes perpetrated against me in my childhood. This response from the NSW Police reminded me of AHPRA’s similar treatment of my child abuse history. Members of the Murwillumbah Pistol Club said they had not previously seen police target someone’s registration as they had mine. They concluded it was retaliation for my whistleblowing against an international child trafficking ring. Certain NSW Pol ice further contributed to my harassment, by ignoring my requests for their assistance. During Halloween 2014, I arrived home to find my child’s dog baited and lying in a pool of blood. Days following the baiting, my next-door neighbour approached my prope rty in a rage and started smashing at our locked front gate. He screamed at me: ‘I should have killed that dog! I’m gonna kill that dog! ’ He motioned to jump our fence. A friend and ex-police officer was visiting my home at the time. She instinctively intervened and managed the neighbour’s violence. It took her five minutes to make him leave my property. She called the police who attended and provided an event number: 56705529. The police promised to at least caution the neighbour - but did not."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":" 460 I am convinced the neighbour would have assaulted me, because he previously assaulted my brother without provocation. Shortly after moving from Wollongong (a major centre of my childhood abuse), the neighbour approached my brother, who was entering his car to attend work. The neighbour ambushed him from behind, grabbed him by the throat, and pinned him to his car. The neighbour, who my brother had not previously met, grinned and dared my brother: ‘ Go on! Hit me!’ By Easter 2015, harassment of my family reached unprecedented intensity. Our problem neighbour targeted us via his umpteenth vexatious complaint to local authorities — this time regarding a fence we legally erected years ago. Then another one of my high-profile perpetrators died, triggering another adverse reaction. Soon after, I suffered a mild head injury in a bizarre car accident. Not long later, our family therapist caved under the unique pressures of working with an incomparable case of ‘complex trauma.’ Losing our family therapist at such a critical mom ent, the timing appeared orchestrated. Just after our therapist emailed her sudden decision, our problem neighbour intentionally coated our property in asthma-inducing fibreglass debris for the third time this year. Immediately after that, local police targeted our young daughter. Police attended our family home after 8pm on a Friday. They claimed a pink iPhone 4 had been reported missing three hours earlier and that the Find my iPhone app had determined it was located inside our home. The senior investigating officer dogmatically asserted that the phone app constituted infallible technology and was accurate to within two metres. She immediately concluded our 10-year-old daughter had stolen the phone, dismissing any testimony, evidence or suggestion our daughter might be innocent. The officer was defensive, aggressive, sarcastic and evasive. She could not provide us with an event number. She threatened to visit our home and interview our daughter to \"jog her memory\" concerning the phone’s whereabouts. She communicated to us that her questioning would frighten our child into confessing she stole the phone. I told this officer she did not have permission to interview my child and that she would have to obtain a warrant. I went without sleep for two day s while I placed my daughter in hiding and lodged a number of complaints to relevant authorities, including to the NSW Police Commissioner. This was not the first time I had been forced to hide my children. The offending officer effectively accused my child of committing a crime while in the care of her school. Consequently, the school became heavily involved. The school's principal phoned police and told them it was impossible for our child to have come into contact with the missing phone. The senior investigating officer hung up on the principal who subsequently labelled her , ‘... a disgrace to the police force.’ My complaints resulted in a formal investigation – which is ongoing – an apology of sorts and a police show bag being presented to my bewildered 10-year-old. Every investigating officer who attended our home said they had not witnessed the screen shot evidence. I have yet to be shown the alleged screen shot. I do not believe the evidence exists. When I challenged the offending officer, by asking whether it was possible for someone to fabricate the screenshot, she agreed it ‘could be a possibility’ but that in 20 years of policing she could not see why that would occur. After ten years of intense harassment from a variety of course, including the polices, I fully appreciate why someone would seek to fabricate evidence against my family."},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":" 461 Such as when police ambushed three family homes and held guns to my husband, I believe the iPhone incident was fabricated as a means of re -traumatising my family and silencing my witness testimony. Police demonstrated far more enthusiasm for investigating a missing pink iPhone 4, than the countless incidents of child abduction, rape and murder I witnessed as a child victim of an international sex trafficking ring. In Se ptember 2015, despite having been warned three times by the Tweed Shire Council not to, the offending neighbour again deliberately coated my home in fibre glass debris. A lawyer subsequently advised me to attend the local Court and apply for an AVO. I followed this instruction. Tweed Heads Court staff asked me whether my children would be included on the AVO, to which I replied: ‘Absolutely.’ The Court then told me that only the police could take out the AVO. I said the police refused to do this. The Court instructed me to immediately march next door and ask the Tweed Heads police to take out the AVO on behalf of my family. I followed this instruction also. A senior Tweed Heads police officer told me there were insufficient recent incidents for police to tak e out an AVO, that what the neighbour did in October 2014 constituted sufficient grounds, that he could not understand why officers did not do so in 2014, and that I would have to wait for the neighbour to build up a ‘dossier ’ of offences and commit a serious act of violence against me or my family before police would act in our defence. The officer provided me with yet another Event Number to add to my dossier: 61680488. He suggested that the neighbour continued to commit crimes against my family because I was ‘reactive.’ His theory for criminal motivation is inconsistent with the neighbour’s surprise physical attack on my brother who had never previously met the offender and so no reaction could have preceded that assault. In short, the NSW Police have instructed me to wa it for a violent man to successfully seriously injure me or my children in another surprise, unprovoked assault. Forget Al Qaeda. Our family lives with the tangible threat of being intermittently terrorised by certain police and random citizens. People, including police and therapists, have offered glib remedies to our predicament: Just move house. Just act normal and polite when police turn up. Just ignore the neighbour. If you know you’re going to be attacked, just go on holiday. We’ve tried all of that — and it doesn’t work. Such advice demonstrates ignorance of how elite crime rings operate. There is no avoiding an infinitely resourced network that has infiltrated every level of the Australian political and judicial system, as well as all the major establishment institutions. There is no reasoning with its members, whose confidence and arrogance stem from knowing they are protected. The Australian public often say of child abuse victims: Why didn’t they speak up? Why didn’t they go to the police? If pedophile rings are as widespread as victims claim, why can’t the public see any evidence of it? Perhaps, after reading this article, people will better understand why. I have endured decades of the types of incidents I describe here, including pet killings, attacks on my family and bizarre mistreatment from health professionals. I have experienced random, unprovoked attacks from complete strangers, an undesirable element within the police force and violent neighbours who suddenly migrate from significant childhood abuse"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":" 462 locations. To the uninformed, these events appear to be mere coincidences or the result of something I must have done wrong. But to those with knowledge and experience, this is a recognisable pattern — the modus operandi of a powerful, well-funded child trafficking ring with a vested interest in silencing witnesses like me. Therefore, when you see victims publicly testifying before the Royal Commission, or you encounter a masturbative collection of warm fuzzies boasting the title ‘Messages to Australia, ’ spare a thought for the voiceless mass of victims like me, whose testimonies were indeed reported but will never be publicly disclosed or addressed — thereby preserving the myth of the existence of such abuse. * * * On Monday 2 November 2015, I took a 6am flight from Gold Coast airport to Sydney. I was scheduled to complete two days of police witness statements with two Sutherland detective s at Surrey Hills police station, beginning that day. During the flight, I sat in front of ABC 4 Corners television presenter Kerry O’Brien who served as PM Gough Whitlam’s press secretary. The day before this flight, Kerry O’Brien launched his biography about his good friend of 40 years, Paul Keating. My press conference , which focussed on Paul Keating and Gough Whitlam being pedophiles , was held the Thursday before Kerry O’Brien’s weekend book launch. So, my press conference cast a shadow over the book launch of the journalist seated behind me for the next hour . (And people say there is no God.) Nicky Davis, Australia’s SNAP representative, was currently negotiating with ABC 4 Corners who expressed interest in interviewing me on television. They subsequently expressed greater interest in interviewing another victim of Bob Hawke who had come forward, the daughter of Bob Hawke’s architect Kevin Borland (who had family photos featuring Bob plus two sisters who were willing to testify that she immediately disclosed Bob Hawke’s assault to them). I turned to the guest seated behind me and smiled, ‘Hi, Kerry. I’m due to appear on your show. ’ ‘Oh, really? Which story is that?’ ‘The VIP pedo ring. I’m the one who delivered the press conference last Thursday.’ Kerry O’Brien gasped in horror and dropped his gaze into the magazine on his lap. ‘I’m on my way to Sydney to make two days of police witness statements.’ He stared in horror at his reading material, nodding out of synch with my words. ‘Don’t worry,’ I assured him, ‘The police will probably want to gag me from further media exposure anyhow.’ Kerry O’Brien announced his retirement from ABC Four Corners four days later. After landing in Sydney, I spent the day providing witness statements in the company of Australia’s SNAP representative, Nicky Davis, plus Sydney’s top court support worker. The first day ended on the most traumatic part of the two days. For the first time in my life I described the crime scene where former Prime Minister Paul Keating raped and murdered a young blonde bo y on a remote Kurnell beach, and doctor Leonas Petrauskas made me dig up the body. I began to sob. It took a moment for the three women to notice. ‘Fiona are you okay?’ they chimed."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":" 463 No, I was not okay. I was contemplating the incident in depth for the first time in my life, simply because no one had ever asked me to detail it before. No therapist. No cop. No- one. No-one had ever cared enough to simply ask me what I saw. Soon a fter, I floated out of the police station in a cloud of dissociation and headed toward Central train station. Nicky ’s voice was a distant echo as she insisted on accompanying me to Marrickville, an inner Sydney suburb where I was to meet Dr Reina Michaelson. I had booked accommodation at the Travelodge Hotel opposite Hyde Park in the city, but I sensed danger and cancelled at the last minute. I asked Reina to find me alternative accommodation and tell no one, including me. That way, I figured, if I did not know where I was staying, neither did anyone else. But ASIO already knew. The government obviously didn’ t want Reina and I speaking privately and comparing information, because ASIO began stalking Reina again from the moment we spoke . Reina even confronted an agent staking out her house in a w hite van. Reina had planned for us to meet at a café just outside Marrickville train station. So, I was surprised when she met me on the platform. We hugged. Then Reina’s face went from smile to serious. ‘ Fiona, they’re here for you.’ My gut dropped. ‘ Who’s here? ’ knowing full well who she meant. ‘There are two men stalking me. They’re waiting for you outside the station.’ Nicky, Reina and I remained on the platform as we discussed our options. My training had already kicked in. Just then, a man brushed past us, growling menacingly. ‘That’s one of them! ’ Reina exclaimed. I sized him up from behind. Military haircut, clean pressed blue work shorts, clean work boots, high viz yellow bib, off -grid communication device in his right hand. They were ASIO-T4 pr otective security thugs – and he was the ringleader . Must protect Nicky and Reina , I thought. I noticed the smart phone in my hand and announced: ‘I’m getting a photo.’ I ran after the stalker and took several photos of him from behind. Then I got as close as possible to his back, positioned my phone, and yelled: ‘Hey!’ He turned around and I snapped a full-frontal shot. His face was clean shaven, his work clothes clean and crisp. It was 5pm and this guy had certainly not been at work all day. I spun around with the agility of an acrobat and took off toward Nicky and Reina. ‘He’s coming!’ the girls exclaimed. We quickly exited the train station, but the stranger caught up with us just outside. His hands were tightly clenched , and his veins popped out of his outstretched neck as he struggled to contain his rage. I braced myself for a physical assault. I guarded my cell phone so he couldn’t snatch it from me. His demeanour was reminiscent of the Holsworthy military thugs from my youth. ‘Why did you take my photo!’ he yelled at me. ‘I was just returning home from work!’ I took a step forward and thrust my finger at his ugly face: ‘You have been stalking her! (I pointed at Reina) and now you’re stalking me! I’m calling the police! ’ He flinched. ‘No, I’M calling the police! ’ We exited the platform with Nicky at rear.

We sat at a table. ‘There will be a fourth one standing across the road there, ’ I pointed across the road, ‘observing the operation from a distance.’ ‘Yes, there was!’ Reina and Nicky chimed. ‘ We saw him.’ A police car pulled up at the train station entrance whic h was out of our view. A young female officer began speaking with two of the ASIO agents. Nicky and Reina expressed their concern that the stalkers were trying for ‘false arrest’ against me. I noticed additional police cars circling us like sharks. ‘Those guys only need one police mate,’ I warned, ‘and I’m stuffed.’ I had asked the Sutherland detectives for their cell phone number s in case something like this occurred, but they declined. I phoned Sutherland police station and asked for the detective who took my statement. The desk officer had no idea of my case and I had no time to explain it to him. ‘ Ma’am, stay there and we’ll send an officer to you! ’ No , I thought, there are plenty police officers here already. Reina pe eked around the corner again, to gauge what was happening. ‘I’m out of here, ’ I told Nicky. ‘No! You can’t go!’ ‘I know what I’m doing. I must go now.’ ‘No, no! You can’t go!’ ‘You’re not listening. It’s time for me to go.’ ‘Okay,’ she resigned. ‘Meet us at the Travel Lodge hotel.’ ‘Okay,’ I lied. In Nicky’s words, she turned her head for a moment, looked back – I had disappeared into thin air. I fled down a small backstreet at a brusque pace, but not so fast as to arouse suspicion. I turned right into the first tiny lane, to lose sight of the cop cars circling the main street . I t was a dead end. At the far end of this lane, I pressed my body hard up against a slither of protruding brick wall and swapped my pink shirt for beige. I caught my breath and thanked God I had been swimming daily for the past two years. I spied two shopkeepers chatting from their back porches. They were obviously wondering what I was doing. I offered, ‘Have you watched the news lately where they mentioned three prime ministers were pedophiles?’ ‘I heard about that, ’ responded one woman. ‘Well, that’s me. I’m the witness. I’m in Sydney making police statements and now I’m being chased by bad men.’ ‘You go to police!’ her Asian friend demanded. How could I explain? ‘Err, not really. That’s not the best thing right now. Some police are helping the pedophiles.’ Enough time had passed for me to move. I surveyed my options: scale a 10 -foot brick wall at the dead end of the road or return the way I came. I’m too old for this Jason Bourne shit! I moaned. I’m 46, not 26 . The women read my mind. ‘You can go through that gate, ’ one pointed to a spot behind me, ‘ through their back yard, up their front veranda and out their front gate.’ ‘Thanks, ’ I waved and ran off. I traversed the suburban streets until I found a safe place to hide, from where I could monitor the passing traffic. My phone rang. It was my detective."},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":" 465 I explained I was in a state of shock, trauma and dissociation, and I had to flee because I didn’ t know whether the cops who turned up at the train station were good or bad. I asked her what my legal rights were concerning photographing a stranger on a station platform. She said she did not know but advised me to send the photos to multiple locations and delete them from my phone. ‘I’ve already done that, ’ I said. The detective tried to convince me to contact Nicky and Reina and reunite with them, otherwise there would be police looking for me out of concern for my safety. ‘Look, ’ I explained, ‘unless you can convince me I’m not going to have some bullshit charge slapped against me by these pedo stalkers – I’m on the first flight out of here! ’ ‘No, don’t do that. We want you back tomorrow to finish the statements.’ ‘From my perspective, I know it only takes one bad cop to cooperate with those stalkers. I need you to phone Marrickville police and sort this out. Then phone me back.’ I called my friend who lived in a nearby suburb. ‘What’s happening?’ she asked. ‘I’m in trouble. They’re after me. I’m hiding in the Marrickville backstreets.’ ‘I’m at work. I’m forty-five minutes away. Can you get to my place?’ I hung up my mobile which immediately rang. It was my detective. She assured me I was not in trouble and that everything had been sorted with Marrickville police. She had contacted the female officer who responded to the stalkers’ call. ‘The men said they were perplexed that you took a photo, and that they were just innocently returning home from work.’ ‘No. That’ s not what they were doing. That’ s not what two credible witnesses saw.’ ‘The officer did suspect there was another side to the story. I’ve asked for her to send me her report.’ I emerged from my hiding place and walked down the street. I spied a man closing his business for the day and approached him, ‘Can you please call me a taxi from your phone? I don’t want to do it from mine. ’ I explained my situation and that I was on the run from some unsavoury men. He explained that there was a taxi depot nearby. ‘Can you please walk me to it?’ He agreed. ‘If you carry my bag for me, ’ I held it out for him, ‘ we will look like a couple.’ The stranger nodded and slung my black duffle bag ov er his shoulder. We walked several blocks to a taxi repair depot where my new friend instructed the m to get me a taxi. Within 30 minutes, I was safe in the home of a prominent Sydney barrister . That evening, I watched as ABC Media Watch presenter Paul Barry personally attacked me for daring to speak at a press conference about my child abuse, instead of critiquing the media’s coverage of my press conference as he was supposed to. Reina Michaelson later phoned me and commented, ‘You were amazing. Everything you did was perfect.’ ‘When will this end, ’ I sighed. ‘Fiona, I think this is a life sentence.’ "},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":" 466 * * * The NSW Police promised to visit my home and take an estimated five more days of witness statements.

(1 Peter 3:15) Bond University destroyed my career in October 2010. For two years leading up to that moment, I juggled study with debilitating stroke symptoms, rehabilitation, excessive scrutiny, sabotage, and my own children’s special needs. Then suddenly my life was still. Suddenly I noticed I was deeply exhausted. Suddenly I had the time and headspace to sleep. I slept heavily most days. When not asleep, I watched Christian satellite television, listened to the Bible, or prayed. I prayed continually for three specific things: vindication, compensation, and reinstatement. Three weeks into my hiatus, I fell into a deep sleep in front of the television. A n hour later, I suddenly awoke. I was wide awake. I went from the deepest sleep, to being as awake as anyone could be. My eyes remained shut as I heard a TV evangelist announce: ‘GOD HAS HEARD YOUR PRAYERS!’ I immediately fell back into a deep slumber. Sometime later, I awoke again. My eyes stayed closed as I listened: ‘DO NOT FRET ABOUT YOUR SCHOLASTIC CONCERNS.’ I fell deeply asleep again. Then I was suddenly alert, my still eyes closed. ‘YOU WILL BE JUSTIFIED!’ I slept again, and again woke up to the pastor’s loud voice: ‘YOU WILL BE RECOMPENSED!’ Dead asleep. Then wide awake: ‘YOU WILL BE REINSTATED!’ I fell asleep again. I awoke in time to hear the pastor’s final words: ‘I had not intended to give this sermon. I had something else planned. I don’t know why I gave this sermon. Perhaps there is someone out there who needed to hear it.’ Jon ignored me whe n I tried to tell him that God spoke to me through the television set. So, I relayed the strange experience to my psychologist friend Luciana who laughed at my exhibiting classic signs of the very thing Bond tried framing me with. The following Sunday, I awoke at 6am and could not fall back to sleep. I then did something I never usually did, I went into our lounge room, turned on the television and flicked through the Christian satellite channels. Jon then did something he never typically does. H e emerged from the bedroom and joined me. We caught the end of a story about a university student who took a moral stand against something she believed in. The student was consequently victimised by university staff. What started as something small snowbal led until the university was eventually investigated by a powerful external body. In response, the student said, many of the offending lecturers chose to resign instead of implementing the recommended changes. The remaining university lecturers approached the student and admitted she had been in the right all along. Jon’s mouth dropped open and he glanced at me like one of those rotating fairground clown heads that devour ping -pong balls."},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":" 468 ‘See, ’ I smiled, ‘ I told you the television was talking to me.’ I phoned Luciana and handed the phone to Jon who confirmed, ‘Yes, Luciana, the television talked to me too.’ ‘Fiona, ’ Luciana marvelled, ‘You’re like a clairvoyant or something. People think you’re weird because you say all these things without any evidence for it, and it makes you sound paranoid and crazy. But then, months later - it all comes true!’ * * * Anything Except the Biblical Jesus Christ In today’s Western society it is acceptable to embrace all kinds of weird spiritual beliefs. It is fine to be a Zen Buddhist and believe in reincarnation, or to consult an Indian guru for advice on mantra. It is cool to embrace the Mormon belief that they will populate their own polygamist planet, or to experience Shamanic visions and communicate with animal spirits, or to dance naked in the forest and chant to Mother Earth. It is acceptable for people to gather in the mountains and wait for visitations from alien UFOs. It is normal to consult mediums and spirits to find out how your dead loved ones are faring in the afterlife. It is acceptable to speak of the ethereal concept of a ‘Christ consciousness.’ It is even okay to be a Satanist and attend conferenc es and ritual orgies. In fact, all these beliefs and practises are deemed ‘culturally acceptable ’ by mental health practitioners. It is hip to be anything these days – except one thing: it is not okay to be a Bible believing Christian. If I say I communicate with my God, or if I experience strange events in the context of my Christian beliefs, then that apparently makes me crazy. I am labelled a crazy right-wing fundamentalist because the people doing the labelling are Luciferians who hate God and who strive to achieve the opposite of everything the Bible says. My Secret Source of Strength I was asked on social media: To what do you attribute your ability to not only survive the unspeakable but thrive? You seem to be thriving to me. You are powerful. Firstly, I do not always thrive. My supporters simply do not get to witness my private meltdowns. I too was once fragile and frightened, and at times I still feel threatened and anxious; hence I still suffer with Complex PTSD. But I get what people mean. I seem to thrive relative to the condition most victims of extreme abuse are seemingly in. Many victims are curled up in foetal positions in the corner of some psychiatric ward. Or they have committed suicide already. But those are the visible victims. People do not realise that through mind control the filthy rich elite have created an invisible population of survivors who appear to function within society. These victims walk around oblivious to the content of their implicit memory systems. Their core issues manifest as numbness, or mental health issues for which they take prescription medicine, or else they drink, sex, or work to distract themselves from the unspeakable reality. Mental health issues only overcome those in conflict with their implicit involvement in clandestine cult and network activities. And yes, I was born with innate abilities that helped me survive. The qualities that John Gittinger and his vile associates selected me for are the very same ones I employed to fight their programming. Their training is what I used to defend myself against their agents. I"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":" 469 turned their skills on them and bit them on the arse like an angry dog. But I am only what God made me, and what Gittinger tampered with. God created me an introvert like every other member of my large family. Gittinger changed me to an extrovert. If Gittinger had not changed me to an extrovert, I would not have been able to speak publicly and interact with victims the way I have. It is as the Bible says: But as for you, you thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive. My survival is testament to the existence and authority of Jesus Christ. My belief in the Biblical God and His only son Jesus Christ is the fundamental reason I managed to recover my memories without cracking or dying. That is my big secret. That is my source of hope in the face of adversity. That is where I found the courage and strength to defy my abusers and dare to heal. Deep down I know that Jesus Christ is Lord, that this world is under the temporary occupancy and rule of Lucifer and his vile minions, and that there is a real, tangible afterlife as described in the Bible. Yes, I am a crap Christian. My abusers specifically targeted my childhood belief in God and made it near impossible to relax, pray, concentrate on reading the Bible, and trust in an all-powerful, all-knowing, ever -present Creator. My survival is testament to the existence and authority of Jesus Christ . It has been difficult to reconcile why this same God allowed one innocent child to experience so much pain and terror . I sometimes ask, why did God let one little girl experience more hell on earth than ten thousand lives combined ? What is the point to all this? Why does God let bad things happen to innocent people? Why am I still he re? It is not enough to just survive, with my head barely above the flood waters. I want a break. I want peace. When will God avenge me? When will he silence and destroy my enemies? Where is my vindication, compensation and reinstatement? Where is my Job-like ending? Job’s life was a picnic compared to mine. His calamity struck all at once during his adulthood, and he had a stable childhood development to fall back on. I had no such base. These are the questions and arguments I share with God as I stomp around in frustration, anger and anxiety. Why Do Bad Things Happen to Innocent People ? I was in my early twenties when I grasped the story and meaning of Job. Job was a wealthy, righteous and socially respected man. God and Satan had a wager at Job’s expense. God instigated Satan’s focus on Job by asking him whether he had considered Job and how upright he was. Satan responded by accusing God of wrapping Job up in cotton wool, and he challenged God by betting, if God took everything from Job, the man would curse God. So, God gave Satan permission to rob Job of his possessions, then his kids, then his health. Even worse, Job’s wife began nagging him. Then Job’s mates accused Job of having done something wrong to attract such calamity. In all this, Job still did no t blame God. For many Bible pages, Job debated with his three friends. He challenged God to appear so that he can have it out with Him in person, like I did atop that Alaskan mountain. Finally,"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":" 470 God did appear before Job and his three friends. At this, Job dropped to the ground in terror. For many pages, God asked Job many questions about the natural world. God asked Job whether he is able to feed all the wild animals, control the weather, or physically wrestle wild beasts. Job crapped himself in awe and admitted he knew nothing about such things. Finally, God told Job: ‘Listen, there is more going on in this world than you can imagine. So, until you know how to run the physical world, don ’t tell me how to run the spiritual world.’ In the end, Job was restored, in a sense. He had a second family of kids who were the most handsome in the land, greater wealth, and was publicly vindicated before his mates. Justice is Coming People discredit the existence of the Biblical God by saying a loving God would never throw people in Hell. They also question why a caring God would let such horror happen to innocent children like me. Here is my understanding of such matters. Firstly, God gave humans free will to do as they choose. The things some people chose to do, the Bible says, are so evil that they never entered God’s mind as being possible : And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. For a person to be judged and sentenced to prison, they must first commit the crime. God allows perpetrators to rape, torture, and kill children because if they did not physically act on their potential and desire for evil, they could not subsequently be judged and eternally punished by God, and so they would qualify for Heaven. I don’ t want to spend eternity with Luciferian pedophile scum like Kidman. God showed Ezekiel a vision of the priests secretly performing cult rituals inside the Temple, and asked: Is it nothing to the people of Judah that they commit these detestable sins, leading the whole nation into violence, thumbing their noses at me, provoking my anger? Therefore, I will respond in fury. I will neither pity nor spare them. And though they cry for mercy, I will not listen . God then instructed an angel to: Walk through the streets of Jerusalem and place a mark upon the foreheads of all who weep and sigh because of the abominations being committed in their city. God then instructed five more angels to: Follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked. Show no mercy; have no pity! Kill them all – old and young, girls and women and little children. But do not touch anyone with the mark. Begin here at the Temple. So, they began by killing the 70 leaders... "},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":" 471 God said: The sins of the people of Israel and Judah are very, very great. The entire land is full of murder; the city is filled with injustice. They are saying, ‘The LORD doesn’t see it! The LORD has abandone d the land!’ ...I will fully repay them for all they have done. God hates the satanic ritual murder of babies. Human sacrifice is the ‘abomination that causes desolation’ which will occur in the Third temple. Luciferian ritual and sacrifice are the root cause of social decline . The Old testament is simply a history of God’s chosen people oscillating between worshipping the Biblical God and worshipping Lucifer. When they served God, the Jews prospered. When they practised Satanism and sacrificed their babies to Moloch, their society fell apart. So, it is today. The 350,000 strong Belgian march against their government’s child trafficking operation proves that people power can’t fix this. Only the direct intervention of God can clean up the mess Western society is in for throwing out the Ten Commandments, school prayer, and Christian morals, in exchange for witchcraft and pornography, drugs and divorce. That is why another Passover is coming – to end this evil age . I nstead of painting lamb’s blood over their door lintels, an invisible mark is placed on the foreheads of those who believe in the Lamb of God. Those spiritually marked by God will be spared from the coming holocaust in which the Bible predicts two thirds of Jewish people will die. I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to damage earth and sea, saying, ‘Do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have marked the servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads.’ God will exact justice. He will issue the death penalty. His order of vengeance will mimic that recorded in Ezekiel. It will start at the Temple, with allowing the Luciferians to perpetrate another holocaust against the apostate Christian churches and Jewish Synagogues, before turning His sword of justice against the Luciferians themselves. What can we do to help? People often asked me on social media, ‘What can I do to help the plight of victims?’ I am only one voice , they think. How can I possibly make an impact on such a vast operation? As the above Ezekiel vision shows – the most important thing is to care. If y ou care, that will influence your every action and at least prevent you from contributing to the problem . God marked and spared those who felt anguish over what the Luciferian pedophiles have done to mankind. We have only two sides to choose from: good or evil , no shades of grey. This is increasingly evident as the Luciferian pedophiles make their move for global control. I have tried to relay in this book how this has come to be, and how their system of control works. Hopefully, this book helps to make sense of everything that does not make sense. Jesus Christ instructed His followers to be witnesses for the truth. A witness takes the stand and tells the court what they personally experience d. Christians were not asked to play judge, jury, prosecut or, or defence attorney. We are not here to argue and prove. We are"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":" 472 here to testify to what we believe and why, to explain the reason for our sense of hope when people ask. A pastor asked me whether I was going to get someone reputable to write a forward in this book and so vouch for my credibility – and by extension, my sanity. I responded, ‘Who do you suggest will raise their hand to have an ASIO target painted on their head? I have a psychiatrist who was the Royal Commission’s first choice of expert witness to publicly testify regarding the impact of child abuse on adults. But she would be stripped of her registration if she endorsed this book. And who am I trying to convince anyhow? If people aren’t convinced of my story after reading Relevance of Intelligence which contains complex , previously unpublished information - nothing will convince them. If people don’t want to believe me, then my book is not for them. They are not my target audience. In fact, I don’t want them to read my book. ‘My target audience are the victims who recognise my testimony because they themselves lived it. My target audience are victims who don’t dare respond to me on social media for fear of being detected. My audience is the pe rson who writes to tell me: “You are the reason I get up in the morning ,” or “I believe in God because of you.” Do you think I care what the public say about me? I am very experienced at being hated: I’ve been defamed on national TV by the ABC, I was slandered to the Psychology Board, I was continually vilified on social media. I just soldiered on through their incessant attacks, which is the reason I got so far with my story - I did not crumble at their insults. So, as if I care now what people, who don’t want to know the truth, think of my book.’ ‘Your story is hard to swallow,’ he conclud ed. ‘Then they are going to have a hard time swallowing what the Bible says is coming next. My book is just the appetiser for the main course described in Revelation. The Bible says men’s hearts will fail them for fear of what’s coming. What do you think could cause people to drop dead in fear like that? If people can’t handle my book, how will they handle it when what I witnessed under Pine Gap manifests and enters their own homes? My job is to just tell people what I experienced. Their choice how they receive it. Duty of care fulfilled.’ I left the most unbelievable things out of this book. I have taste d the spiritual and seen things that I can’t begin to share here, things which prevent me from denying the existence and authority of God. My supernatural experiences of God’s authority and power are relative to my experiences of the most vile and evil darkness. That is a fair balance. I understand that God’s nature is softer and gentler than I thought. I know that He only bothers disciplining and changing the character of those He cares about. I know He never pushes us beyond what we can endur e but squishes us right up against that line. I know that somehow God weaves everything together so that in the end, it will all make sense. I know that God can take what people intended to harm and destroy me and turn it into the best thing that could hav e happened. Yet intellectually knowing and emotionally feeling are two different things. Life hurts. Life is pain. Happiness stems from a word meaning ‘luck.’ Happiness is a transient state of being which depends on current external circumstances. Joy, however, transcends our physical surrounds , and is a result of belief and faith in God. I might not be happy with my worldly situation - extremely unhappy. I’m not that joyful either. But I do have a sense of hope. They can rob me of my social reputation and standing, destroy my career, kill my every interest,"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":" 473 ruin my finances, break my marriage, threaten my kids, poison my pets, turn my family against me, take my friends, decimate my physical health, and publicly mock me in the media. The one thing they can never destroy is my belief in Jesus Christ. True ‘transhumanism’ and eternal life are attained by simply believing in Jesus Christ, believing that He is who the Bible says He is. Remember the thief hanging next to Jesus during the crucifixion? All he said was, ‘Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.’ Jesus replied, ‘Sure thing.’ All the thief did to gain what these Luciferians have been struggling to invent themselves was believe and ask. No Kundalini serpent crap, no legalism, no exchange of money, no dressing and speaking the right way, no secret doctrine, no ten steps to this or eight steps to that, no magic, alchemy or technology. Just belief and request. I believe God can restore me if he chooses. I believe He will indeed vindicate, compensate , and reinstate me. But exactly how He will do that, I have no idea. It will likely not occur in this life. And in the great scheme of things it does not matter. What matters is that Heaven and the Lak e of Fire are real, tangible places – just as real as what we physically perceive right now. Have you ever sat too close to a campfire so that it became uncomfortable? Have you ever experienced a traumatic accident? Have you ever felt the pain of losing a loved one? Take every horrible thing that could happen to a human being and multiple it - and continue increasing it. The result does not begin to touch on what awaits our enemies. Justice does exist. God’s justice will ultimately prevail. Belief in God’s omnipotence , omniscience , and omnipresence is my secret survival tactic. That is my source of hope within. * * * "}]
