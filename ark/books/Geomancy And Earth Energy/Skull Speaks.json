Dennis Miller was there when needed and put in a great deal of time and effort. Jackie Field lent her support in the beginning and helped pioneer the way as we delved deeper into the unknown. Ann Emerson offered help and encouragement in the field of \"Psychic Archaeology\" pioneered by her late husband, Professor Norman Em erson, long time Director of Archaeological Studies at the University of Toronto. Others we have met through Sammy Mitchell - Hedges and her magnificent Crystal Skull include the late Sheila Conway and her daughter Kathryn Conway - Dickson, Caroline Boddie , Laura Smith, David and Shelley Brady, Bill Drysdale and dozens more including so many wonderful people at the Edgar Cayce A.R.E. Foundation in Virginia. Gerry Jennings has given so much of his time and help in putting this book into print. Without h im, it would probably never have happened. Last, but by no means least, our thanks and praise to the late Miss Cynthia Cowles: Secretary, Companion, Guardian and, for many years, a very dear and trusted friend to Sammy Mitchell - Hedges. She was truly th e \"Keeper\" of \"The Keeper of the Crystal Skull\". AUTHOR’S ADDENDUM: For this updated E - BOOK edition, I wish to thank Edward Hofman, a young computer ‘genius’ who put it all together, D’Arcy McHayle, an old friend who helped edit many of my earlier mistakes, and W. Paul Blakey, from distant British Columbia, for his most friendly and generous advice.  "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Introduction This book is the result of many \"trance - medium\" sessions in the presence of the Mitchell - Hedges Crystal Skull through which the Medium - Carole Davis - answered a variety of questions posed to her by the author: Questions that have puzzled mankind over countless centuries. Neither Carole, the author - nor anyone else for that mat ter - can vouch for the authenticity of the information received or that it actually came directly from the Crystal Skull. However, we ask the reader to evaluate each and every answer to the questions posed and to critically assess the other information vo lunteered through the Medium. Whether or not it did come directly from the Crystal Skull, from the mind of the Medium herself, or from a Higher Dimension may be secondary to the actual information itself. Knowledge is, after all, knowledge whether it comes from \"out of the mouths of babes and sucklings\" or from the Wisest of the Wise. Carole Davis is a highly respected \"Psychic\" with an international track record in many areas of the paranormal. That this book is being published at all is an indication that we believe in her sincerity and integrity. However, it is both her wish and ours that you ignore her role - her \"personality” - in all of the communications and concentrate your intellect solely on the material received.     Brian Hadley - James "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 The Discovery of the Crystal Skull Anna Le Guillon Mitchell - H edges actually caught her first glimpse of the Crystal Skull in 1923, but it was to be several weeks before she was to know just what it was she had found. Sixteen years old at the time, young Anna - nicknamed \"Sammy\" by F.A. \"Mike\" Mitchell - Hedges, th e English explorer/archaeologist who had adopted her six years earlier - had spotted a glassy - looking object lying just out of reach glittering under the earthquake tumbled walls of what had once been an ancient Mayan temple. Left in the care of a local Ma ya Kekchi Indian family while her adoptive father and the rest of the white members of the expedition had returned to civilization for supplies and additional funding, young Sammy had been warned never to move any stones until they had been plotted and cha rted in accordance with the archaeological procedures of the day, and - being an obedient young lady - she had followed her instruction to the \"T\". The ancient citadel, in which the Crystal Skull lay, was discovered by \"Mike\" Mitchell - Hedges in 1919 wa s, at the time, the largest, in terms of area, of any that had been found in the New World. The expedition he led had been granted a seven year licence to carry out an archaeological \"dig\" by the British Honduras (now Belize) Government in whose jurisdicti on it had been found. Mitchell - Hedges named it \"Lubaantun\" - a Mayan word which meant \"The City of Fallen Stones\". Sammy was rejoined by Mitchell - Hedges and the other members of the expedition shortly before Christmas (1923) but it was to be several more weeks before she could persuade him to start the men working in the area of the fallen temple."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 One by one the giant slabs were gently removed as the crew sought to uncover the large object which lay gleaming beneath the rubble, but it was not unti l January 1st, 1924, the day of Anna's seventeenth birthday, that the final slab was lifted and the upper portion of the Crystal Skull finally retrieved. As Mitchell - Hedges held the Skull high for all to see, the Maya Kekchi workers suddenly went wild with joy. Laughing and crying, they kissed the ground, hugged each other, and acted as if an ancient memory had suddenly been triggered; that each of them knew of the crystal icon that it was a significant part of their past - and now, after countess cent uries, a deity was once more returning to their lives. They built a makeshift altar and, as Mitchell - Hedges placed the Skull upon it for them, their drums and whistles began sending out the message of joy, summoning every native for miles around into the p resence of this completely unscathed, exquisitely beautiful relic, from their mysterious and distant past. The celebration went on for days bringing all work at the dig to a complete halt. Unable to persuade the Mayans to return to the job, Mitchell - H edges struck a bargain with the Chiefs. He offered to give them the Crystal Skull if they would continue their tasks. The deal was struck and the following day the Kekchi natives resumed clearing the site. It was not until three months later that the detachable lower jaw was discovered, also completely unscathed, and the full impact of the skill and workmanship was realized by Mitchell - Hedges and those around him. Made out of a substance that was nearly as hard as a diamond, in craftsmanship alone the Crystal Skull was a masterpiece, probably one of the finest man - made artifacts ever found, yet who, among the ancient people of the Americas, could have possessed such knowledge and skill? Or did it, as Mitchell - Hedges believed, come from a civilization ev en more ancient that the Mayan? Fifty seven years later the same questions remained unanswered. For the next three years, from 1924 to 1927, the Crystal Skull remained in the possession of the Maya Kekchi Indians while the dig continued through to th e end of the Mitchell - Hedges' exclusive mandate in Lubaantun. During the seven"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 years they had been there, thousands of rare and beautiful artifacts had been unearthed, painstakingly cleaned, and then catalogued before being shipped to the British Museum a nd the Heye Foundation in the United States. Finally, the last artifact was crated, the camp struck, and the expedition prepared to leave the site for the last time. For Sammy, now a young, sun - bronzed woman of twenty years, it was especially hard to part from the native family and MayaKekchi friends with whom she had remained for seven long years. She had grown up among them, sharing their homes, their food, their joys and heartbreaks without once having returned to civilization during the entire period. I t was to be a sad farewell tempered only by the excitement she felt at the prospect of seeing the world she had left behind. The final departure of the Mitchell - Hedges expedition was a great loss to the Maya Kekchi people. Not only would they be losing their contact with the outside world, they would also be losing the work and income that had enabled them to purchase modern tools, utensils, and so many other items which eased their lives and had given them a toehold on their climb into the Twentieth Ce ntury. In addition, Mitchell - Hedges had provided them with modern medicine, medical attention at the hands of visiting physicians, and continual nursing care by members of the expedition. All of which helped to alleviate so much of the suffering they had e ndured prior to the discovery of their ancient citadel. It was by way of showing their love and heartfelt appreciation that the Chief, along with his Medicine Men, made the supreme gesture just as Sammy, Mitchell - Hedges, and the rest of the party were abou t to leave. They presented Mitchell - Hedges with their most treasured possession, the Crystal Skull, as a token of their gratitude for all he had done. Buried for centuries amidst the ruins of a once proud and flourishing civilization, this enigmatic me ssage from an ancient past was to begin its long and eventful passage into the future. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 Session #1 May 9th, 1982 INT: Interviewer, Brian Hadley - James VOICE: The voice of the Crystal Skull, as transmitted throug h medium Carole Davis VOICE: We understand that you come seeking in quest of the beginnings of man. We wish to tell you that you have to cast your eyes not down, but up. We wish to tell you that the civilization which you will eventually bear a part in bringing to the attention of the world was definitely that which resided off the coast of Bimini. We wish to tell you that there will be a discovery within this area. The beginnings of civilization were created upon your earth - as far as we can jud ge the time - over fifteen thousand years before the discovery, and before the acknowledgment, of that which you call Atlantis. Atlantis did not merely exist in one area, but covered a vast continent. There will be many discoveries pointing to the acknowle dgment of man within the next... five... ten... fifteen... twenty years. This will so confuse, and cause so much disharmony, that it will bring about the separation of life and ways as you know now. We have told you before that there is... will be... and h as already begun, a great change within your Mother Earth; through that which is of natural cause. We urge you again: Make known to mankind the things which we are to give you, in hopes that the holocaust can be prevented. They cannot be changed but they c an be diffused. You wish to know in which certain continents new discoveries will be made. As far as we can understand your timing and geography... we shall give them to you: In South America... in Australia... and within the Sinai Desert, towards the end of the year 1983. Within this year there will be discoveries beneath the oceans. Within the year... in the month of July... within the year... within the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 month of September... there will be more rising up of land masses... and there will be more destru ction brought about by atmospheric intervention, [see Appendix #1]. You ask if there are any more secrets to be unlocked within the pyramids? Within the Mayan... within the Egyptian... we wish to tell you that your civilization with all its knowledge, has grossly misunderstood the use of light and sound. Therefore you have only uncovered that which is closest to you. You have been called from reincarnated memory to bring knowledge and understanding. You were - in your incarnation at the time of the Atlantean Empire - a communicator. You did not communicate with speech... you did not communicate with the written word... for these were not of your knowledge then... you communicated through the atmosphere. You have the name \"Telepathy.\" You also see k understanding of the origin of man. From other dimensions into this dimension we came to experience. Our \"world\" or dimension was without pure emotion... pure emotion... not that which is experienced now. For this purpose, we undertook... [Carole begins to experience great inner turmoil during this section. At one point she tries to articulate but no words come. She makes mantra sounds: long, drawn - out sounds similar to the Yoga \"Ommm.\" These mantras are used to help clear the channels of communication wh enever Carole feels distressed, or when the vibrations which are used to create the thought patterns become \"scattered.\"] [Now in a strong, masculine - sounding voice] VOICE: My...my...name... [another long pause]... we... then... took upon ourselves the physical form which is recognizable to you. We understand that there is difficulty with communications due to the pressure of a Mayan priest with the name May - jee... May - jac. He was responsible for the use of this tool [the Crystal Skull] in controlling an d governing unto the needs of the people of his time. He is anxious that you should know his story... [The voice begins to become strained, and louder] He is anxious that you should recognize his life... He is anxious that his personality be represented."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 [Just as the voice reached a peak, an antique clock struck the hour of four, effectively stopping the communication in mid - sentence. She paused briefly then continued.] The use of this artifact [the Crystal Skull] was to control weather... to cont rol growth... to control personality... to heal... to soothe... to comfort and to command. It is not difficult to understand that light refracted through this artifact becomes power. The power source that is well understood. You would consider this, in your language, to be a \"computer,\" and when the right vibration is produced, it will give you the information you require. The earth life of this artifact is seventeen thousand years. It has been handed down from generation to generation. Polished wit h hair and sand, its true life was as part of the \"Great Crystals\" [of Atlantis], and within it are locked many minds. They - combined with the right vibration - will predict much. The Crystal Skull will also unlock many mysteries, for it is constant and l iving and it is fed with energies you do not yet understand. But we are willing to show you. We hear your questions but we can only answer them if you will keep this one thought in mind. How may we help you? INT: You can help me by giving me informa tion on the origin of the Crystal Skull and the origin of the crystal... and perhaps, the geographical location from which the raw crystal... or the Great Crystal... was taken to form the Skull. VOICE: The origin is the great crystal of Atlantis. We did not take, we cultivated. When we realized there were those who had forgotten their original purpose in incarnation to this dimension and this world... and that there would be a catastrophe... many of us chose to leave behind the legacy of our minds knowin g that we would not again reincarnate. We chose to remain in other realms until such time as your knowledge and your seeking and your spiritual progression - would turn you toward this path. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 The Crystal Skull was well guarded. It was born of sea and fi re: There will be others found, for no one man - and no one mind - were given all knowledge. When all are placed together, you will be \"Keepers\" of wondrous knowledge. But the time is not yet. Mankind still seeks to better all the original destruction of o ur time. INT: What level of civilization had been attained at the time the Crystal Skull was formed? VOICE: It was formed by a pre - Mayan civilization. Our level of civilization, at that time, was far in advance of that which you now have by certain f actors. We were able to use that which you call your body as a further adjunct of our minds. Much as you would use your hand to grasp, we used the flesh to experience, for the mind cannot fully experience. But there was our downfall. Experiencing isn't as great as... [The voice becomes somewhat emotional] desiring... and soon there were those who were slaves to their own creation - the body - and had forgotten their original thought. INT: Does this coincide with Edgar Cayce's material relating to the \"So ns of the Law of One\" and the \"Sons of Belial?\" VOICE: \"Sons of the Law of One\" we understand... we do not... [pause]... Yes, we understand. In part... in essence... this is so. INT: In relation to the continents as they exist today, can you give us the location of Atlantis, or the continents of Atlantis, as they existed prior to the destruction? VOICE: The greatest discovery of such, has been and will be, in the area of Bimini. But you will find traces of our civilization through most parts of yo ur land masses, for travel was an easy acquisition. We did not need vehicles such as you have designed for yourselves. Our energy was that of the sun, and the water, and the moon. INT: Did the continent of Mu, or Lemuria, also exist? I"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 VOICE: We do no t recognize these sounds. But there is much beneath your oceans. The oceans that we claim are known as the Atlantic, the Indian, and that which you call the Dead Sea. There, closest to your earth's surface and soon to be discovered, are remnants of our civ ilization [see Appendix #2]. We were not vast in numbers, but vast in mind. Do you understand? Not vast in numbers but vast in mind. INT: I believe I do, yes. VOICE: For thought can be transferred and planted. All it needs is a fertile mass. INT: What are the functions now of those who you say were former Atlanteans? VOICE: Because of the disasters upon this planet, you will be needed to call upon your reincarnational memories to heal, to counsel, to guide and to love a world gone mad. A worl d without knowledge, without hope, where the fire of destruction will reign. Your technology and your knowledge, with which you left our time, will be needed, for the world, as you know it, will not exist. Even now, your Governments play with toys that they do not understand. They play with light and sound, and rain havoc and because the reaction is not immediate, they continue and continue until this very planet will erupt and destroy. INT: Are there any of the ancient \"Masters\" among us today? VOI CE: Yes. INT: Where can they be found? VOICE: India, South America, North America, wherever there is a mind willing to open itself to their instruction. But, of course, in your third dimensional thinking, you wish to know, \"Are they in body at this time?\""},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 INT: Yes. VOICE: Yes, there are those who are yet preparing. And yes, you will find them in all the \"Light Centres\" of the earth, preparing...preparing... INT: Would you explain the term \"Light Centres?\" VOICE: Your earth will be covere d in darkness and there will be certain geographical locations which men will migrate to. Wherever the Crystal Skull resides will be a Light Center. There will be seven... all of which will be given at a later date. INT: Will there be a so - called \"Secon d Coming\" of Christ and, if so, when and where? VOICE: We do not....[pause] You ask an esoterical question. The force of God is everywhere. It was never, and is never, given to one and one alone. There will be many. INT: It is said there are reposito ries of knowledge in different places on this earth. Can you enlarge on this information? VOICE: Egypt... India. Mountains... mountains... high in the mountains. Beneath the ocean... [whispers] It's dark... [Voice shows signs of distress] INT: During a previous session, you gave a \"Mantra\" that you said would \"open\" the Great Pyramid. Can you repeat that for us now? [Voice continues to show signs of distress. Carole tries to articulate but cannot for a while] VOICE: In that which you call your des erts will be found much knowledge. There is much interference. We wish you to explore the ocean bed. We will direct you. We will show you that which you call a \"Temple\". It was an area of communication between the earth and other solar systems.

You will be brought into contact with an entity, and you will proceed to where you are shown, by us. You will be instrumental in unlocking one area of communication.

You will receive comm unication of an expedition that you will join. We will make the way clear for you. This mind is fragile [Carole's]. It will not venture below the earth's surface. How strange... how strange! INT: Will you clarify what you mean by \"this mind\"? VOICE: The mind which we now use to communicate with you. INT: Are you saying that I will not go beneath the surface?

VOICE: We have placed it in the mind [Carole's] and the consciousness will give it to you at a later date. We can only communicate with this mind by \"visualization\" but it refuses to be put in that position, beneath the sea. When we push, we are rejected. INT: I understand. Can you teach certain gifted people the art of healing, or weather prediction and control? VOICE: Locked within the Crystal Skull is everything you need for healing... weather... growing. It is merely a tappi ng of energy and, as you know, a crystal is living energy. [Pause, then answers emphatically] Yes! It can be awakened in each and every mind. We understand, from looking further, that this entity"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 [Carole] will not accompany you, for it is in fear. But all that you need will be given. INT: Thank you. [Pause] I have brought Miss Mitchell - Hedges a suggestion regarding the formation of a Foundation to take care of the Crystal Skull instead of it eventually being placed in a museum. [See Appendix #3] Are you aware of this and, if so, what are your feelings regarding the suggestion? VOICE: This receptacle [the Skull] will not reside in such a place where it cannot be used. This receptacle, along with others, will be used to give pertinent information to the leaders of the world; those you call your scientists, and those you call your healers. If it is placed in the wrong hands, it will destroy itself. Never fear, it has been guarded and guided for many an age. No harm will come to it. This receptacle is a com municator and when the right minds are brought together, regardless of the \"informer\" [the communicating mind], there are many who can do what this mind does. Our knowledge, crystalized here, will be imparted. Each will be given as each can use and each is needed. No one person, no one mind, no one entity, will be given all. We must now release this mind for it is in distress. [This ended Session # 1] Additional Information after Session # 1 Phone Call - 8:30 a.m. on May 10th, 1982. [Carole phoned to say that she had received information from the Skull during the night that she felt must be added. This information was recorded over the phone.] VOICE: You have asked for the origins of man and, due to communication difficulties, we were unable... [Record er snaps off for a moment] As we have instructed you, your reincarnational function is to bring to the general populace instructions as a Teacher. We ask you, please, to bear with us in that the \"Time - Relationship\" is very difficult for us in this dime nsion."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 We came to your earth from a different Galaxy. We came, experiencing, and needing to experience, density. That which we first heralded had nothing of the density of what you call a \"body\". We were aware of life on this earth plane, but life was i n its primitive form. We thought only to bring knowledge and enlightenment, and to experience it [materialism]. We did not confine ourselves to one geographic location; there were many, and many of our relics and many of our teachings are to be found scatt ered amidst your land masses and your sea masses. Much of the world that we created, we created with \"mind\". Mind creates matter. When we sought to infuse the knowledge that we had into the minds of those that we found on earth, we had to start with ve ry basic and very primitive ideas, which caused much havoc and, indeed, we were responsible for the annihilation of the people when we tried to procreate in your earthly way. There were those who overreacted in their desire for learning. They enjoyed what you call the \"power of being superior\", and it is only on a very small scale that one can be advanced enough to override this. You will find this tendency now amongst the earth's populace. It is, indeed, fact that there was a place given the name, \"Atl antis\". Atlantis was, as you may understand, our \"Headquarters\", our \"Governing Body\". It was there that we grew crystals for our light. You will understand, and crystal technology will be given to those who understand it in more detail, that a crystal i s a 'living' substance and you can infuse mind with matter. That is what we did, knowing that the destruction of our planet was soon to be coming upon us. We have given details in previous communications [to other enquirers] as to where in the Galaxy we we re to be found. But still you cling to the idea that we are of the 'third dimension', and you still cannot grasp the idea that there are also those that you call the fourth and fifth and sixth and seventh dimensions, each varying in that which it produces and that which it needs. You will be instructed as to where and when you are to investigate the findings in the area off the coast of Bimini. [see Appendix #4.] You have asked where, on your land masses, you will find other communications, and we tell you, Africa... South America... Brazil... Egypt... almost anywhere where there are traces of ancient civilizations. You will find traces that we left for those whose"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 spiritual knowledge, and those whose incarnational duty it will be, to instruct others wh en your earth moves from its axis. For this is what caused the Great Flood, and this is what caused the destruction of many a landmass. This has happened already, the destruction. Something has already taken place, for you have, with your primitive kno wledge, started something which now cannot be reversed. It was started through your scientists playing with and bending sound and light waves into your atmosphere. You will have noticed that there are many destructive waves now hitting your planet, from wi thin and from without (See Appendix #5} and masses will appear; land masses will disappear. There will not be one great 'Final Day'; but the only 'finality' will be in man's thinking, and it is then that you will be needed. There will be horrendous mind i njury and body injury that your science has no way of counteracting. It is then that the 'Healing Temples' will be needed before the healing will take place. Within the Crystal Skull, and that which we have left you, lies everything that you will need. The part of the planet in which you now reside [Ontario, Canada] will be an area of 'light', for there will be great darkness that covers your earth. [This could be referring to such volcanic ash clouds such as those that were strewn into the atmosphere from Mount St. Helens in the U.S., and other volcanoes in Mexico and Java which, like those from previous geophysical eruptions and giant Meteor collisions in the past, covered the globe in a blanket of darkness]. If our communication appears somewhat repetitive, it is because we have no way of understanding, no way at this point, of knowing how much, or how little, was given to you at the time of yesterday's communication. You must remember that the object of communication, the Crystal Skull, has many minds, and it is only with one mind that we can override or control what is given in speech. There are great difficulties, for this mind [Carole's] is more used to communicating on a lower, and more acceptable, level to the personality. We will instruc t you in the subconscious state, or in repose, as to more details that you will need for your printed words. You will find that the Atlantean subterranean tunnels will be communication Centers of learning. Also, how it is"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 possible with the aid of the Cryst al to impart from mind to matter that which you call 'psychometry'. This is what you will find, and this is what will be found in all parts of your planet. It only takes a 'like mind' to interpret. Do not fear for yourself that the 'other party' came to h urt you, or hinder and mislead you, for they cannot. [He was probably referring to the Priest Entity who had tried to intrude his personality into the previous session. He had once been a 'Keeper of the Skull,' which seems to have left him with an in flated ego. The voice continued.] Their mind was not in that which you call 'yourself', and it struggled to retain its hold on the Skull. It had difficulty communicating in the fourth dimension of the Priest. There, in the fourth dimension, you will find those entities who still think their function is that which brought them honor and glorification of the 'self 'in their former incarnations. [Thus ended the taped phone call.] "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 Session #2 October 30th, 1983 [ Carole took a fairly long time to slip into a trance state on this occasion. After a while she began repeating a portion of the material she had already delivered to those who have attempted to reach the intelligence which lies within the Crystal Skull. This transcript picks up the material given after the initial preamble. ] VOICE: We feel an intelligence. How may we help you? INT: A year and a half ago I came to you and you said, at that time, \"We urge you to make known to mankind the thin gs that we are to give.\" Well, I am now here to fulfill that obligation and, after a great deal of soul searching, I feel it is necessary - with your help - to write a book and to pass on this information to others. Are you willing to co - operate in this endeavor? VOICE: We affirm your obligation. You have been summoned. We are here, this time, to give. INT: Thank you. In order to get the point across to the world at large, or those who will listen, I have a series of questions which I later want to develop into chapters for this book. The first question is: What is Time, and how does it relate to other dimensions? VOICE: Your understanding and our comprehension of Time are very different. In other dimensions we do not comprehend or understand your meaning of Time. However, since we have existed in your slower vibration, we can perhaps help you with this concept. Time can only exist when there is no thought of continued existence. You, and other people of this third dimensional space, have been cond itioned to believe"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 that Time exists because, upon this space, you will only remember your 'being' while the mind operates within the structure of your 'body'. The concept of Time and Relativity has been placed within the consciousness of those who govern a nd those who would destroy. We will teach you that time is a nonexistent factor. The dimension you understand - of speed and light and change of vibrationary energy - is our understanding of Time due to the magnetic poles of the Earth's tedious progres sion towards extermination. We, who were here before, left this understanding within the 'Collective Consciousness,' for to change - to be able to change - a vibration at will would be, for those who would destroy, a powerful tool of domination. The 'E ssence of Time ' is an illusion. When the axis of your earth is changed, you will understand even more deeply that Time has been created, in fact, by a Higher Intelligence as a form of control upon the brain and function of the body image. Time is a sa feguard against corruption but, in essence, is non - existent. The illusion of Time must remain for a period. Do you understand? INT: In the general sense, but only in the general sense. Since we are discussing Time, what about Infinity? Is there Infinity in Space... in Time? VOICE: Where there is no end, is there then a beginning? There is no 'Infinity'. Again, you look for a measurement for thought. 'Thought' needs but energy to exist. To place a limit on thought is impossible. 'Thought' will remain lo ng after the destruction of the body... long after the destruction of the brain... long after the destruction of matter. 'Thought', then, is a form of energy which is immeasurable but which can only be seen in the demonstration of achievement. In space we do not need to create matter with 'Thought'. 'Time' is the creation of matter. INT: 'Thought', therefore, is non - molecular?"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 VOICE: [Puzzled by the definition] ... is... non - molecular... is non - molecular? We will search... [Pause] 'Thought' is without 'Time'? [Pause] Your understanding is correct. INT: Then thought is 'pure energy'? VOICE: We affirm. INT: These concepts are very difficult for us in the third dimension to comprehend. [Pause] Destiny... what is 'destiny' if there is no such thi ng as time? VOICE: The words given seek to define a beginning and an end - or 'thought', again achieving - of 'thought' turning to matter to obtain. Thought - pure energy - seeks only to return after having 'collected' other energies which you call 'Und erstanding'. There is no destiny of one; there is only the destiny of All. 'It' seeks itself to be at one with itself and with the ultimate creation. Destiny of one individual, of one personality, again defines the link with Time which was left with yo u as a safeguard. We ask you now, would it be acceptable to all on your earth plane to know you were All at One! INT: By \"All at One\" do you mean God? VOICE: God... gods... masters... teachers... pure uninterrupted energy of Mind. The concept of an i ndividuality known as 'God' was a governing idea left with you in the hope you would seek your way back. A thought so strongly permeated in your earth's atmosphere that you sought to worship it as One. Your concept of God was not individualized by those wh o came originally to this dimension, rather it came about by the slowing of vibration and the taking on of matter. What we sought to leave you was the concept of 'Oneness' - a concept left to permeate, encircle and cover your small earth with a 'Collective Consciousness' that would feed your earth the idea of Love and Growth. When you entered your temples to worship, it was hoped that you would be 'at one' with each other - to send out that pure energy into the atmosphere to nourish your planet - to create life upon your planet - vegetable, animal - but the concept"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 was misguided. Therefore we reinforced this concept with individuals who came upon the earth to walk amongst you. But still, those who would destroy were stronger. Those who would dominate and hav e power... and use this power - this energy - for self - gratification... fed upon these individual personalities. INT: Was Christ such a 'personality'? VOICE: There have been many. We will seek. [Pause] We affirm this, there was such a one within your \"time\", by name, to us...[Pause] You would have known him as \"The Nazarene.\" You would have known as \"Teachers\", seven. Seven there would have been in number, Seven. INT: Can you name these Seven for us? VOICE: We do not see you in your Space and Ti me. We will tell you that each has been worshiped for 'personality' when, truly, they came to bring and enforce the concept of “The One”. Each was destroyed in a negative way by those still left who took upon themselves a reincarnation of 'force'. We will tell you there is yet one more. INT: Has this entity been born into our present time? [Long pause] VOICE: Not as an entity of one, but as an entity of four. Two walk about your space now. One is nearing the time of leaving and one is yet to come. All are one and the same. You will find one upon your globe in the farthest reaches of the mountains. [Pause] You will find the fragments of consciousness of many being summoned to this place at this time. INT: Define 'this place', please. VOICE: Wherev er in space you find this receptacle, the Crystal Skull. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 INT: Thank you. [Pause] Regarding Time, and Time in our dimension. Prior to the Great Flood - or the last great flood - people reportedly lived to a great age; in fact for hundreds of years. Is t his true? VOICE: We spoke earlier of the ability to take on and discard the 'material' - that which is known as the 'body'. It could be left quite comfortably in an altered state which, we understand, you call 'sleep'. While the body was in the altered state, we could then carry on the instruction and the preparation for entities [the souls] of those to come. We could then carry on with the task we had come to this 'Dark Planet' to undertake. There are many, and still are many - even in this space - who , in your understanding, will live to a great age. For your understanding of 'living' is, again, either destruction of the material body or existence of the \"mind.\" There were, indeed, many who could leave their bodies at will. Even here at this session y ou will find one who is able to accomplish this with small effort [Note: Referring to Carole Davis]. INT: Who, then, were the first Homo Sapiens? In what type of 'body' did they first reside? VOICE: You talk again of two “Intelligences”: One which was nurtured in the earth's atmosphere, and one that came with intelligence from an 'outer' atmosphere. You talk of 'Two of Man'. You talk of the 'Soul' and you talk of the 'Personality'. There were those who took on the mantle of 'Man' that had already b een created on this slow, dark planet, and you talk about that which came from another galaxy. There was never a time when Intelligence did not exist either on this small planet or without, in other galaxies.' INT: Do all creatures have Souls? VOICE: All that is, is part of the whole. You have created your earth. You have created your life, be it animal or vegetable. You have given life to all that is perceived by you, whether it be negative or positive. All eventually returns to One. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 INT: Thank yo u. [Pause] If I may pass on to another subject. 'Sound'. You've talked, in the past, of Sound. We need to know a method of harnessing sound - high and low frequencies - to form an energy power source that we can use. Can you give us any information on thi s? [A long pause ensues followed by an emission of long drawn out 'sounds' as Carole Davis gradually undergoes a 'personality change'. When next she speaks, her voice takes on a flat monotone]. VOICE: You have come seeking technology that, in the ha nds of the wrong intelligences, would bring about a path of destruction on your earth greater than you can ever imagine. [Short mantra] You have asked for precise instructions for a device to emit that which can cause disintegration of the material. You ha ve asked for precise instructions for a device which, used in the wrong context, would cause your intelligence to scatter to the winds. [Pause]. However, we will assist. You must bring before us those that are in harmony with the living crystals. You m ust bring before us those who would understand instructions on how to use the crystal to oscillate and vibrate. We would show you then that with different currents of power of a...

With the mind only, we will show then one such individual who has been summoned and who will come into your understanding when your year is new, before your weather h as turned the cold to the heat. If you take the living crystal and place it in a magnetic comparative you will find that, already, it emits a sound. You do not hear the sound of the Crystal and it is created by a fast friction of the Crystal.

To stop any possible damage to the Skull, the interviewer changed the subject]."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 I NT: Thank you for this information.

There are still some that have not been given 'life'. There are some whose energies are still to be tapped. You are, we believe - as we seek out your understanding - going to another part of your earth in a space of time you know as \"very shortly\". We ask you to look for that which is called the \"Stone of Green\". You will find much history attached to this small article; placed in a time when it wo uld be hidden from the general intelligence of mankind. But even now it is being investigated.

You will find, within that atmosphere, one that has written about this stone. [Pause] Library ... library... library... storage... storage of knowledge... of knowledge.... INT: In London?

If you wish to release her, please feel free. VOICE: [Begins a short mantra] Your question concerning other \"Receptacles of Mind\", which you asked at an ea rlier date, will be found. [Referring to the Session of 1982]. You were given precise instructions. If you show the mind (Carole's) that which you have, she will be able to inform you as to the whereabouts of another receptacle of knowledge left for your i nstructions. INT: You have said that it would be found off the coast of Bimini. VOICE: There will also be one that will be delivered when Atlantis rises to you. We look at it within your space now and we believe this rising of land is imminent, if no t already taken place. We would give you one also where we left markings upon the earth. INT: Nazca? [Meaning the Nazca Plains in Peru which are covered with enormous geometric designs]. VOICE: This feels affirmative. We would tell you also that with in the Great Pyramid there is one also. We would tell you within the birth place of this mind [Carole's] there is one also. [Referring to Wales.

"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 INT: Do the other receptacles take the same form as the Skull, or are they in a variety of forms? VOICE: There are forms that are the same and there are forms that are different. INT: The \"Keeper of the Skull \" (Miss Mitchell - Hedges) found a crystal statue in the Bay Islands many years ago. Is this one? VOICE: This is also a \"Receptacle of Mind\", this is Spiritual Knowledge of mind. This is a \"concept of God\", of God, of One - ness. This was put into the recep tacle with personality. On the other hand, this receptacle, the Crystal Skull, has no personality input. INT: Should it be searched for, or has it already been found? (Referring to the Crystal Statue). VOICE: It has already been discovered. It has be en temporarily manufactured into an area where it will not be disturbed until the right intelligence comes for it. It is already emanating so therefore you will soon be able to bring the right intelligence to it. At any given time these receptacles, when t hey feel the pull of Earth's atmosphere, or the pull of \"like - minds\", will emanate from themselves and those like - minded people will be summoned to them. Do you understand? INT: Yes, I do understand. I have one question of burning interest and concern a nd that is the well - being of all of the Intelligences, the Intelligence of the Crystal Skull and all of the other receptacles. Obviously some of us have work to do, this has been made very clear. How are we to do this work? How are we to gather together to carry out this work? Can you give us any hints, any leads or guidelines? VOICE: Since you have now been summoned and, in your own words, you \"searched the soul\", then the way will be made clear for you. We have understandings of materials which are nee ded in third - dimensional life. Emanations are now being given out from this receptacle at this time to bring"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 within your understanding – indeed within your handclasp - those which will help you. This will then form a chain, a link of one to another. Do not worry. [There is a momentary interruption as a second tape recorder shuts off automatically. Her voice becomes slightly derisive]. VOICE: (conts) Your primitive recording devices! Your mind is far more important than the spoken word. [Resumes] Even now you are receiving emanations from this receptacle which will bring about the third - dimensional materialism that you need. First we work upon that which is the creator, the Mind, and then it will manifest itself within the third - dimension. [Gently and with compassion] We have an understanding of your life... we have an understanding. We are here to help. INT: Thank you. (Pause) Do you have any other information to give us at this time prior to release? VOICE: Receptacles are placed in the four corners of your earth, within the four pillars of your earth, within the seven seas of your earth, and we ask you to think on receiving of emanations. This will activate the \"life - force\" within the crystal receptacles and, as you know, \"like - mind\" attracts \"like - mind\". Should you seek, then the Teachers will come to you. You will have to be the seeker. We ask you to 'think out', for even now we activate all crystal receptacles. We are activating all of the \"Receptacles of Mind\" that they might, at this time an d in this space, be used for the betterment and the collectiveness of \"one mind\" of your small, dark Earth. We came and we left, but before we left those of us who had come as we were bidden left a small part of our Intelligence that it might be of benefit in time of great tragedy upon your earth. The tragedy is not the destruction of the material world; the tragedy is the separation from One - ness. Seek now to join, for the receptacle seeks to find you.

Since the last session (Oct. 31, 1983), when you gave me a great deal of information, I have followed t hrough with your request to search for information regarding the \"Stone of Green\" and, so far, have tracked down where it is. What would you desire us to do as far as the next step is concerned regarding the \"Stone of Green\"? VOICE: Communication with t hose who handle the receptacle. Communication and meeting of minds... written words... spoken word... contact of minds... need for understanding. Their understanding is not correct. They are seeking you, you must contact them. You must be brought together. Each will vitalize the other. [Pause] You will be accepted. INT: Thank you, I will start that as soon as I get back to Toronto. I have a list of questions again which are the outlines of chapters for the book. May I pose them now?"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 VOICE: We are read y. INT: The first question is, \"What is Love and how may it be used to help all of mankind?\" VOICE: \"Love\" belongs to the compassion of Spiritual self. It is the vibration highest and clearest in its most potent form. It is energy... [Louder] It is e nergy used to clarify and separate the \"gross\" from the material, from the spiritual. It is the energy that is used to create life upon your planet. It is a form of energy used to create life on other planets. It is a wave length of communication. It is en ergy in its purest form. [Mantra] It is not the energy that was put into the \"grossest\" form of life that we found here upon this Dark Planet when we arrived. It was something we brought with us as a means of connecting the Self and keeping the \"One - ness\". You have diversified this energy until its potential power no longer exists. You have taken a pure form of energy and fragmentized it until it is of very little use to you here in the dimension you now find yourselves. It was a way for us to communica te with each other and to that which we belong. [Mantra] Were you to know the true value of this energy you would see how it creates your Universe, your Planet, and all that exists upon your planet. An element of Love is in everything that you have created . Were there more Love you would have a far more beautiful planet. INT: Are Love and Thought synonymous? VOICE: Love and Thought are One when used correctly. Love is the energy used to materialize Thought. INT: Thank you. [Pause] What, then, is the \"Life - Force\"?

It is the pure energy, the pure thought, which you have"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 not yet come to understand. If you take the very nucleus of your being, you will find the energy called Love. INT: Thank you. You said, in the last session, that there was a Master, a Teacher, an \"Entity of Christ\", that could be found on earth at this time, in \"the farthest reaches of the mountains\". Can you be more speci fic? We seek this entity... Can you direct us to this Person? VOICE: This Entity is, at present, shielded by what you know as \"radiation\". He resides now in this barrier, and behind this barrier, as it is not a time for Him to come forward. He communica tes with a receptacle such as the Crystal Skull and He communicates with the pureness of Thought. You will find Him... He will find you. He is seeking you and there will be communication, including a meeting place of minds, when your earth is turned warm. INT: Is this the period of the \"turning of the Earth's axis\"? Or is this before the turning of the axis? VOICE: This is at that time, the time of change within this Small Dark Planet. He will make Himself known to you, but by then He will have divide d Himself into Four. You will meet with the Four. INT: Thank you. You talked of the \"Collective Consciousness of Man\". Is this the same as the Universal Intelligence? VOICE: [Mantra] This is what is needed to create and sustain Life within this Small Dark Planet and your life is about to become much disrupted for lack of this. [Pause] This is affirmative. INT: Thank you. We like to believe in, to invent and create, so called \"original concepts\", etc., but are we merely tapping the Universal Intelli gence? VOICE: The Universal Intelligence, in your understanding, is part and parcel of some of yourselves. There is a residue left in your atmosphere that can be reached when pure Thought or the energy of Love is extended. You also carry"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 within your con sciousness the key to this. Let me explain further for your understanding. When we arrived upon this Small Dark Planet it had, trapped within its atmosphere, all thought forms that were of a negative vibration. The density of this planet being slow, and th e surrounding atmosphere being thick, it had trapped within it all negative thoughts from other galaxies. Therefore life had begun upon this planet in a very gross, dense, and non - intelligible way. When we arrived it was decided that we would impart, as yo u would understand it, a Soul within this gross and negative intelligence. We thought, for our own sacrifice, to amalgamate ourselves with that life which we found here upon this Small Dark Planet. We then discovered that it would mean the severing of our consciousness, our \"Love Vibrations\", with that from whence we had come. There were many who so sacrificed their Thought Consciousness in order to amalgamate, to be part of, the first man - as you would call it - upon the Earth. It was then seen th at it could not be tolerated within the Grossness of this receptacle. Once joined, it had become more or less a Gross and outrageous - and not pure - Thought Form. There was no way to amalgamate the Higher Self with this Life Form; too many eons of time ha d gone into the negativity of this Gross Being. It was then decided that, since we could not purify or enlighten this Gross Being or change the vibration of such to our higher level, we would place in every nucleus and into every cell the concept of Ti me. As a result there would be the diminishing of this Gross body and Time in the next dimension for \"purification. \" There were those of us who went through this \"purification\", known to you now as Death, who spent time in the Astral to become more re fined. As we have explained to you, the concept of Time was something we programmed into the Gross Body so it could diminish... could die... and the mind, the Soul, could be more refined in the Astral. There were those, of course, who did not amalgamat e with the grossness of this planet. They decided to remain as long as they could hold onto their"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 vibration and link with those of their own realm to teach... to guide... to refine the planet and the life therein. It came time for them to leave when they n o longer could hold onto this energy. Do you understand us? INT: Yes, I do. Thank you. However, there is one question I must ask. If there are two forms of \"Man\" on earth - the Intelligent Form that came from another Galaxy and the Gross Form that came from within this atmosphere - which of these \"Forms\" are our ancestors? VOICE: All those that can understand, and do understand, the Time factor and the factor of being \"Now\" and \"Here\", are those that would be known as the Gross Form. These \"beings \" have no understanding, cannot accept and will not accept, that there is anything outside of their own consciousness, which is very limited, and will not be able to grasp any concept of \"other\". They do not see beauty... they do not hear music... they do not communicate. You will call them \"Gross Beings\". They will not allow - nor do they seek - to have any change within this Small Planet of refinement. They will not allow you and your influences near them for it would be such as a shining light and it wou ld burn and burn their consciousness. You will make these bodies physically unwell when they are close to your vibrations. They are known as \"The Other\". All those that are drawn within the presence of the Crystal Skull have decided to join the conscio usness of the Love and the One vibration. Collective Consciousness creates Life. You have decided to save the life of this Small Dark Planet. INT: What is the concept of \"good\" and \"evil\"? VOICE: Energy has no conscience. INT: What about \"negative \" and \"positive\" forces, then? "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 VOICE: Negative and Positive forces must exist in this Time and Space in this atmosphere. Your planet is so dense that only the negative is recognized. It is very difficult, almost an impossibility, for this mind to reach out to you. The concept of energy, pure and simple, is much hampered by the density of all that it finds around it. INT: Thank you. [Pause] If you were to give us, today, a \"Modern Creed\" - a new list of \"Commandments\" such as given to Moses - what wo uld it be? VOICE: You ask us to define for you a \"law\" by which you must abide? We would say to you that the Law has been given... and still you fail to recognize it. We ask you to think of only one Creed: \"Collective Consciousness Creates Life. Sep aration causes annihilation and death.\" We do not talk of death of the physical body, which is a small thing and necessary for the refinement and purification of, as you would know it, \"Soul\". We talk of much greater things... The death of this Small D ark Planet. You have built around, in your atmosphere, such that we are finding it even more difficult now to communicate. We ask you...we beg you....we plead with you; \"Look further, look further. This must be stopped!\" All of those minds that are pa rt of the \"Consciousness of Love\", that truly can link with each other, will be used. You must cleanse your atmosphere, you must save this Small Dark Planet... we tell you...we urge you... we... we... [Becomes emotionally overcome and is unable to speak]. INT: [Gently] Some of us do understand. VOICE: [Continues crying softly]. INT: Please, do not be distressed. We do understand. [Crying is replaced by a mantra that relieves the emotional stress]. INT: (Long pause) May we pass on to another subject?"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 VOICE: [The mantra is followed by a long, drawn out groan]. We hear you... we hear you... we hear you. The mind has been released, we will continue. Request your information. INT: \"Music\". What is Music and of what use is it to mankind? VOI CE: \"Music\" as you know it - the \"tone\", and the \"tones of the sound of vibration\" - is to harmonize the Higher Self with all that is in the atmosphere. It is a means of purification used in the growth of Forms of the Body in this time and this place. Ca n you understand? It has nothing to do with the pleasantries and the \"toning\" of the mind, it has to do with the \"toning\" of each organ and of each cell, of each nucleus of the physical body. Did you but know what to do, when you play the music, then you w ould understand more fully the healing of the mind, the Soul, and the body. It is to harmonize you with that which you now have in your atmosphere. Music is for every growing, living thing. It is for animal, vegetable and, indeed, if you would think of the Crystal Skull as mineral, then it must be for mineral also. It is an \"energizer\"... it is a form of power... it is a communication such as your word \"Love.\" It is a form of energy but, of course, the energy of Love is far more potent. INT: But there ar e so many diverse forms of music; some abhorrent to some and some pleasant to some. Why is there such a discrepancy? VOICE: Again, we would remind you of the Other, that which cannot tolerate harmonization and seeks separation. Remember that \"separation \" is disruption. \"Separation cannot create Life. And it is that - a concept of Oneness: Of One Mind, One Thought, and One Soul - enjoining with another. This, [principle] accepted by each [of these components], will create. INT: Thank you. Regarding ou r history - that is the history of our race in the Third Dimension, because it is important to us - \"Mythology\", Gods, Cyclops, Mount Olympus, Dragons, etc. Did they really exist? "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 VOICE: You are talking now of other forms of life that visited this Small Dark Planet. Yes, they materialized into the Third Dimension but, because we had come to your planet by then, we did not appreciate the \"grossness\" of these Thought Forms and so they gradually faded from existence. They did not have the energy it took to sustain them, much as your \"nightmares of the unconsciousness\" do not take conscious form unless they have continued energy to feed upon to nourish, and to make them, as you would call it, “Material”. INT: Thank you. Again, to go back to our history. Ju st north of the plain where you left the Markings on our earth [Nasca Plains] ... in Peru, South America... there are ancient stoneworks and ancient buildings. Some of the walls contain geometric designs and patterns. I am asking you, are these 'Geometric Patterns a form of writing? [see Appendix #7]. VOICE: A form of communication. Everything that was left by this civilization is a form of communication. All it requires is the Key - such as this particular mind - to unlock it. If you would but close the physical ears - the physical eyes - and use mainly the “sensories”, you would find that everything is a form of communication. (Pause) Affirmative... affirmative... affirmative... affirmative! INT: Is there anyway of finding this 'Key' to understanding that writing? VOICE: You have here within your grasp one such Key. There are others. Try the mind of this one. [referring to Carole's mind] INT: Thank you, we will attempt to use the mind of this one. VOICE: This mind is timid, it must be given m uch encouragement. Only trust will unlock this mind to its full potential. You must be instrumental in seeing that this is taken care of. INT: Thank you. I will do my best. One other question: You mentioned Sound in the last session and you used the wor d \"Eeeeee - ny - an\"... \"Eeee - ny - an.\" Can you remember this particular word? [see Appendix #8] "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 VOICE: We understand the sound. INT: We have no comprehension of that sound in our language. Can you clarify it for us? VOICE: This is a sound vibration.. . this is a frequency. You must present this to a mind that is interested in the experiments in Sound Waves. INT: That has answered my question, thank you. VOICE: This will not be understood by a mind other than one that is interested in experimentat ion. We will guide your hand and your mind to such a one; indeed, there will be more than one. INT: Thank you. A question regarding Speed, Time, Space, Size, and the relationship to each other. Can you give us some idea of this relationship? VOICE: The relationship you know as Speed and Size, again, do not exist. Simply, if you make a vibration more pure (“pure\" may relate to speed) then there is no Size because there is no form. Do you understand? INT: Partially, but only partially, I'm afraid. VOICE: If you take a Third Dimensional body from its mind, if you remove its mind from the context of dimension, then it has no size. It travels at great speed but, since there is no Time, no dimension is unobtainable to it. If you take something and you speed its vibration until you cannot see it, then it cannot have \"size\" because it has no \"form\". INT: Physicists say that the hydrogen electron rotates around the nucleus at a speed of 6 million, billion times per second. Does this relate to what you have just said? VOICE: This relates in a very simplistic way. They will not understand it, and it is just as well for they are part of \"the Other\". Those that would tie you to the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 dimension of sound, shape, and size are not of our understanding. Their k nowledge is something that has been programmed into their being so that they will remain as part of \"the Other\". They do not wish changes upon this Small Dark Planet. They seek to keep it Gross. They are happy with the way they exist. INT: As far as Spa ce is concerned, how many dimensions are there? VOICE: We will show you that your concept of Space also is incorrect, but we will do that when your understanding has grown just a little more. INT: How many dimensions are there? VOICE: When there a re no thought transferences, there are no dimensions: All is One. You still seek to separate. We say to you that there are only Three Dimensions. After the Third - and the most Gross in which you now reside - there is no such thing as a \"dimension\" because All is obtainable to you. INT: [Dubiously] Thank you. VOICE: Do you understand? INT: Again, only in a limited way, simply because my mind is that limited at this stage. VOICE: We will offer you an example. We seek to enlighten you. When your mind is working you are deciding - by \"thought form\" - in what shape you would have your material surroundings. You are then working within the concepts of \"shape\", of \"space\", of \"time.\" But, we say to you: When did this \"thought\" appear to you? How d oes it appear to you, and when do you then decide to put it in its Grossest... in its material thought form? When you are given the inspiration of \"thought\", it has no \"time\", no dimension. At any given space you will receive \"thought\". You will unders tand if we give you the concept of Music. If you are close within the range of Music, you hear. If you are not close within the range, you"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 can feel. If you move even further away from the source of the Music, you are unaware that it is there - but indeed i t is - thereby making no dimension, just \"All One\". INT: Thank you. It clarifies it a little. [Pause] Can we talk about 'Healing'? I think it will be very important for us in the future. VOICE: We will change the mind. [Pause] You may question. INT : I have a question regarding a disease, or condition, that exists on earth. We have given it the name \"Alzheimer's Disease\". It is a memory, or senility, lapse. Is there a cure for this and, if so, what might that cure be and where should we look for it ? VOICE: You are talking of a disease which concerns the function of the brain; the \"computer\" of the body in the Third Dimension. This condition has already been programmed. The safest thing is for the entity to go through the passage known as \"Death\" and to pass on to a form of purification known as Astral Levels. You ask to be \"cured\" and we say to you that this entity has incurred, within the span of the Third Dimension, that which has decided it would sooner be \"without\". We then give it the id ea that it may leave the \"body\" so that it may become At One. All have Free will and, at any given time (should one seek to purify and eliminate the negative) it can pass through that which is known as the \"Death Syndrome\". You would ask for a \"cure\" - or something which should not be \"cured\" - while in the Third Dimension. But we will tell you that Sound can play a very important part with the brain, the \"computer\" of the body. However, we would also caution you to say: Do not disrupt what a Soul has t aken on! INT: Does this apply to all forms of sickness and disease? "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 VOICE: This is not in all forms, for there is not a One - ness in everything other than \"mind\". We would say to you that, in various forms of sickness and disease, it is merely the neg ativity of this Small Dark Planet manifesting itself in the Third Dimension and much could be changed by simply using the vibrations you have around you; Sound... Light... Energy and, of course, Love. INT: Is the receptacle through which you are now spe aking [the Crystal Skull] accessible through any means other than a human mind? Is there a possible way of using a form of \"radio\" or other technologically advanced method to access it? VOICE: We have placed it such that it would take only the vibration known as Love to activate all of these receptacles. We did not place it here so that \"mechanics\" could release the information, for that would mean it would be information released to all who came into contact with it. No, you would not be able to get suc h information merely by activating it with mechanical means. It has to be a mind that has been programmed to be of help within the Earth's years - within the \"changes\" (the coming Earth Changes) - and it has to be activated by empathy or, again this strang e word for \"energy\" you use, \"Love\". INT: Other receptacles... VOICE: You will be able to carry out a \"testing\" quality upon these things to, indeed, verify information. But the information needed will be given only through a mind that is in empathy with those, indeed, who have reincarnated and who were of our time and place. INT: Thank you. You have suggested, in the past, that we are to search for the other receptacles... VOICE: They have now been activated and are waiting for you. INT: Reg rettably, in our particular dimension, this is going to take time, money, and effort. "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 VOICE: Then we will assist you in all areas. Explain to us exactly what it is you require. INT: Well, first and foremost, the locations we have to go to are both d iverse and far away. VOICE: You have no means of transportation? We have means of transportation but it does take time and money. How are we to finance this? VOICE: We will arrange that you are given access. We do not comprehend your difficulties. (P ause) We will check this logical mind. We will also check your logical mind to try to understand your difficulties. [Long pause in which a gasp of surprise is emitted] We comprehend. We will assist you with location, we will assist you with the means with which you may travel and obtain use of transportation. And we will assist you by activating the minds that now are in a somewhat controlling position of other receptacles. INT: Thank you, that would be most helpful if we are to follow this through. Ther e is one more question and that is: If all of this is to be brought together we will need a Leader, an Organizer or Coordinator. Can you tell us where such an individual may be found? VOICE: Again we caution you against the use of an individual. We say to you, there must be a \"Collection of Minds\". We tell you that this mind will be very useful to you but you must see to it that there are \"like minds\" to join with them. You do not need \"one\" leader, you need many. We have found that one is corruptible, o ne can be an easy target for the negative forms which surround your planet whereas, if there are many, then the knowledge and the help is spread among you. But we understand your need for \"one\", for do you not designate your \"God\" as a \"One - concept\"? We sa y to you, then, that there should be no personification of One, but rather a group to work as One. [Note: It was the original purpose of the Anna Mitchell - Hedges Research and Exploration Association - like minds to work as a group of \"one\"]. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 End of Sessio n #3 Additional Information after Session Date: November 20th, 1983 [Carole Davis phoned with additional information that she had received throughout the day]. VOICE: Because your inquiring mind asked to know as to the Sound and Vibration known as \"Music\"; We gave you a definition for that time and space. We also offer you, now, another definition. When we came to your planet - small and dark, as we have often described it - we continued as bidden to bring knowledge, understanding, compassion, and that energy which you call Love, to offset all the \"negative energy\" that had been trapped within the atmosphere that was making this a Dark Planet. We manifested ourselves and, indeed, could only exist in the atmosphere in a Sound and Light vibration. You would now understand this sound as Music, and the Light you would understand by the refraction of light through a crystal. There were many of us and, because of our numbers, we were able to sustain ourselves and exist upon your planet. The vibration o f Sound, known to you as Music, was, indeed, our life 's sustenance, if you understand it that way. We could not have existed here without it. As eons passed, and your planet became more dense, even our great numbers were not sufficient to overcome the \"gr ossness\" of Mankind who had existed, and did exist then, upon this planet. Although we tried various methods to intermingle ourselves with this \"animal manifestation\" [Man] again and again, it was impossible. There were those, then, who decided to take on the vibration of the Third Dimension although still retaining within themselves the Light and the Sound. They existed for many \"years\", as you would call them, within this atmosphere but, eventually, even those dear Souls were overcome and decided that no benefit could be obtained in this time period. They rejected the body and returned to their sustenance - the \"Life Force\". We had at this time left many who, through devotion and Love [that \"energy\"], had decided to reincarnate and use the \"body\" and s tay within the dimension of the Earth to become, as you would call it, Man. But through the dense negativity"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 overcoming them, and being in close connection with them at all times they, indeed, began to dwindle in number. We found that as they returned to t he \"Astral\" that had, indeed, lost their Light and Love and had become almost, if not as much, \"Gross\" as the material left upon the Earth. It was then decided to sustain their growth. We understood the problem, hence we devised a way in which their So und vibration could remain upon the Earth and be acceptable to both the \"negative\" and the \"positive\". In other words, there was the \"Gross Man”, and the \"Refined Man”: The “Other”, and the “One” Man. You call that sustenance \"Music\". It was, indeed, b rought to you by various \"souls\" who would not have been considered, in your Earth time, the best examples of humanity for they had to disguise themselves greatly to be accepted amongst those which you call \"Men\". You will notice that all of those who brought you the Sound vibration [Music] either left your Earth at an early age or suffered greatly with the \"body\". This is because of the constant struggle for survival between the Other and the One - ness within the body. Hence your Musicians, your Great Masters [Composers], all left your Earth in a way less desirable than that which you call Death. [In other words they either had terrible diseases or died horrible deaths. This is another dimension and a further \"depth\" of the Sound which you call Music. [see Appendix #9] [End Session #3] "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 Session #4 December 4th, 1983 VOICE: We seek to... We seek to... [Long pause while Carole spins the Crystal Skull on the turntabl e] We wish to impart information concerning the healing of the material body. We wish to impart this information at a time when your planet will be much seized by diseases unknown to your medical men at this time. We wish to impart information that the mat erial body contains all the substance that you could find upon your planet. Indeed, there is very little difference between the body in which you now reside to that which is grown or found upon the surface, or beneath the surface, of your planet. The d iseases of the material body will find their betterment with all that is upon and within your Earth's atmosphere. We ask you now to be much aware of the diseases which will come about because of that which is destructive within your atmosphere. There will be, at this time and in this place - and within many of your countries on the planet - diseases which shall overtake mankind and which are, indeed, produced by mankind. You have, in the past, asked about future dates and of that which can be helpful. We of fer you now the thought that the healing of your fellow man will be much within your charge, for those of the \"Other\" will decide that there can be no correctable measures in helping the human body. In which case, they will seek to quickly destroy the same [the human body], unleashing \"gross minds\" within the atmosphere that can become - once released from the material body - much more harmful as they will remain close to your earth's atmosphere and build power to unleash upon the minds of the \"Other\" still left within the body. We would remind you that the Earth's atmosphere is full of that which you call \"radioactive beams of light\"... and beams produced by mankind which will work upon the brain, the computer of the material body. This will lead to disease s as yet un - named by your medical"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 men. We will tell you that the corrective measures, the cure of the material body, lie strictly within the Earth, upon the Earth, and within the Earth's atmosphere. We wish to differentiate, this time, between the dise ases and an “ill - at - ease” of the material body, and that of the mind. The mind, or the \"soul\" - or the \"governor\" - of the material body as you would have it known, cannot be helped by that which is grown, that which is made, or that which is in the Earth for this is the part that remains strictly to the force that you know as the “God Force”. The mind can only be helped; corrective measures made within it can only be done by \"like minds\". You will have to use the energies of Love and Light and Sound to make corrective measures within the mind. It can only be helped by the putting together with, as described, the Oneness. It is the mind which creates, and if the mind has been corrupted by the use of the Power of negativity, then this will, of course, destroy the material body. Those whom you have deemed to have “Extra - sensories” will, indeed, be the Healers of the future since no one will be able to understand or use the measures of correcting and of altering the diseases of the body and mind. And whe n these people [the Extra - sensories] so discern that the correction [healing] of the disease is for the benefit of the Other, there will be no correction. The Other will be released of their material body so that their minds will be overcome with positive thoughts before their release upon the atmosphere. \"Enquiring Mind\", we are here to answer your questions. INT: Thank you. Coming back to what you have just been talking about... the \"Releasing of Minds into the atmosphere\"... Are you talking about the release of the minds of the \"Gross Beings\" into the atmosphere? VOICE: That is what we are describing. INT: By ratio, how many minds are there of the \"Gross Beings\" to comparison to those of the \"Minds of One\"? "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 VOICE: The Minds of One are far les ser in number, as you understand number, but of course their strength is far superior to that of the Gross Beings and their understanding far outweighs the intelligence of Gross Beings. Remember theirs [Gross Beings] is not an intelligence which belongs to the mind... to the \"computer\". Theirs is but an elementary understanding or enlightenment, as you would call it, of the Soul or Mind. INT: How can we differentiate, here on Earth, between the Gross Beings and those of The One? Is there any physical app earance, anything at all by which we can determine which is which? VOICE: You would not recognize it in the \"being\" - or in the \"body\" - other than in the eyes. It will, be as you would sense, a sensation you will feel upon gazing into the eyes of tho se you wish to recognize as \"Gross Beings\" or \"One\", for did we not leave you the saying: \"The eyes reflect the soul\"? There is no depth to those eyes of the Gross Beings; they are the eyes of the body and not the eyes of the Soul nor the eyes of the Mind . There will always be some deficiency between the eyes of the Gross Beings. INT: In the last session you talked about the axis of the Earth turning. Can you tell me how this will happen and what will cause the axial shift? VOICE: [Spins Skull rapidl y on the turntable] You talk of the displacement of your planet. This, by degrees, is already taking place. It has been helped by those who would destroy and/or keep the same. This is a lack of growth or, in our understanding, 'Destruction'. It is taking p lace, and has already taken place, because of that which you have beamed through your atmosphere as well as the play by the Sun upon your Small Dark Planet. And indeed that which you have released within the center of your planet, and are still releasing, is known as \"Negative Force Energies\". INT: How are these \"Negative Force Energies\" created? By whom, or by what? VOICE: By man. You would know them as the releasing of forms of combustion and “inter - combustion”."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 INT: Are you talking about nuclear explosions? VOICE: We do not understand your word \"nuclear\" but, indeed, it feels to be correct. Explosions, Implosions of your atmosphere. These are not so serious as those which you now use with Sound and Light, as you do not understand the force of either these things used. You play dangerously with them and even now have caused irrevocable destruction. We cannot assist you to reverse the change. We can only assist you when the change takes place. Remember that the force of the Other is always subtle and never will it reveal itself in a way of sudden understanding. INT: Thank you. You talked, also, of \"cleansing the atmosphere\": Of all of the Minds that are a part of the \"Consciousness of Love\", or \"Consciousness of One\", that must be used to clean our atmosphere. How can this be done? What sort of \"linking of minds\" must be done and by how many, and what \"form\" must the energy of Thought and Love take in order to achieve such \"cleansing\"? VOICE: The cleansing of your atmosphere and the Small Dar k Planet will not take place until it is recognized by all of the \"Consciousness of One\" that there are the Other. The \"Consciousness of One\" must then all be collected together so that one will know the other. We would describe it thus: All those of the understanding of the One - ness will reveal themselves to each other so that at any given time, when the thought is passed between them, there will be such power released by those minds that it will enable us, and you, to dominate the Other. Therefore the at mosphere will be cleansed. You must realize that the Other still inhabit bodies and walk about your Earth. You must overcome them before their minds are released into the atmosphere. You will do this through knowledge, for they are in darkness as to Kn owledge of Light. And as soon as those of the One - ness recognize each other - through printed word and through word that is passed about your atmosphere in beams - and come to understand, \"Yes, we are One and we realize the power of creation which is withi n the Mind\", then all will understand and join with each other. "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 When this happens then you shall, indeed, release your power upon the Earth so that, as the time approaches when the Gross Beings are relieved of their bodies because of their own destruc tive forces, then their minds, going into the atmosphere, will not cause any more than a small amount of havoc upon their Small Dark Planet. INT: What will happen to the \"minds\" of these Gross Beings? VOICE: They link very closely within the atmosphe re of the Earth. In your understanding of Time and Space, we would say that they attach themselves very closely to the density of your Earth. They are not released to Higher Understanding to purification. Indeed, they stay within the close atmosphere of th e Earth to inhabit a material body within a very short period of time. They do not seek understanding - nor do they allow themselves to travel throughout the other spheres in order to gain knowledge and unification. They will not allow themselves near the Light, neither will they be seen or heard. Instead, they will creep upon your Earth and upon its surface, as they were doing when we first arrived on your planet. INT: Are they a part of the so - called \"evil\", or \"satanic\", force that is supposed to inha bit this planet? VOICE: We do not understand your word \"satanic\" but we do realize the concept. We would say that they are \"Gross Negativity\", which is an energy that can be changed into any shape or form far more easily upon this Earth because your Ear th has now become so \"gross\" that it is unable to change the \"fine mind\" (a Mind of the Consciousness of One) into Third Dimensional Purity of Love. A description of a \"being\" upon your Earth - such as the \"Teacher of the Christ Light\" (Jesus) - could not, and was unable to, retain Himself in this density and so was released. This is what we understand you to mean. There are those of this understanding (Christ Light) still upon this Earth but they are clothed or cloaked still within mystery for they wou ld also be destroyed by the Gross Negativity should they reveal themselves at this time. They cannot maintain - as this vehicle cannot maintain (Carole) - communication with the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 Higher Beings for any length of time. Indeed, their material bodies would refi ne to such a state that they would, in your understanding, disappear much as the boiling of your waters dissipate into the atmosphere, never to be seen again. And, in contrast, that which is not of Fine Mind - of One - ness - indeed manifests itself ve ry quickly in your Third Dimension in the form such as your Wars, and your killings, and that which you would know as your crimes. INT: What is the purpose ...I mean the ultimate goal... of the Gross Beings? VOICE: They have no purpose, no destinatio n. They have no goal other than \"being\". Remember they were created from all the negative \"thoughts\" of other planets, of other atmospheres. They settled here only because of the grossness of this Small Dark Planet. Then were trapped here and came into \"bo dy\". There were those who would describe them [Gross Beings] as \"The Putting Out of Negativity\"... \"The Clearing Out of Other Planets\"... \"The Releasing and Purification of Other Planets\". This took place, and that which was released, indeed, settles here upon this Earth. INT: You said that they had been here on Earth [the Gross Beings] for eons of time prior to your arrival in this atmosphere, and yet you also say that it was you who created Time... the \"Essence of Time\"... so that purification could ta ke place. I'm sorry, but I find this to be a contradiction. Could you please clarify this for me? VOICE: You are forgetting that within the concept of \"One - ness\" we always must remember \"Free Will\" or \"Free Choice\". We came to offer a choice. We came to offer them [Gross Beings] the \"Pathway\", the means by which they could be released from their Gross Being. But they chose to remain as they were. These Gross Beings seek not change for they wish to remain as they are. We offered them - as all must be offe red - the chance that they would seek also to be \"At One\", for indeed they were once one small spark. INT: Thank you, I will come back to this subject at a future date. [Pause] During the last session - or the session before - we talked about the \"commu nications\""},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 which were left in Peru, north of the marking you left [on the Nazca Plains]. I asked you if the geometric patterns of the stonewalls were a form of communication and you said, at the time, that this mind [the Crystal Skull or Carole's mind] cou ld help clarify this communication. I have brought with me a picture of one of these walls and I'm asking if this \"Mind\" can give us any insight into what the wall might be trying to tell us. May I show you? [The interviewer places the picture in front of Carole Davis on the table beside the Crystal Skull. With her eyes closed, she \"scans\" the picture with her fingertips]. INT: [Continues] It is a picture of a wall in Cusco, Peru. There, it is under your hand. VOICE: Here you have what, in your unders tanding, would be a formula of a \"Mode of Transportation\", of \"Energy\". Here you have, in your understanding, what would be \"Geographic Location\" [a map] in your Earth Planet. Here you have, in your understanding, what would be a location in your atmospher e. Here you also have information of language which is not of our understanding for we did not create this thing. It was left with the Gross Beings so that they may communicate with each other for we did not require their minds to be so open as to what you would understand as \"Telepathic Thought\" for, indeed, if they had that knowledge they would soon realize that they, too, could create at a much faster rate. [Pause] That is our understanding to what you have shown us. Show, then, to this mind [Carole's] w hen it is released and we will leave further understanding, because you require many words, and words are difficult upon this mission. INT: Thank you. [Pause] I have other questions. One of the recurring legends in our history is a Legend about Fairies, or \"Little People\", who are supposed to exist throughout many countries and continents. Will you elaborate on this and tell us the basis for such a legend. VOICE: A form of fanciful creation of the mind, for when the mind realizes it can create, indeed , there must be fanciful creations. They are merely a vibration that is put into a humanoid form by the mind."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 INT: They don't exist in material form? VOICE: All that which the mind can create can remain for as long as thought is given to it. And, yes, they would remain in material form as long as they are given the energy of thought to remain. INT: More wars... more killing... more destruction... more hatred has been perpetrated under the guise of \"religion.\" Can you expand on this and tell us why t his is so? VOICE: We would again ask you to meditate upon the thought that the 'Other' resist change. Their environment, their whole being, their mind, resists change. That which you would call \"religious thought\" was a concept of One - ness. Indeed, Love can create the thought of a personalized \"God\". \"God\" [religious thought] was also interjected in the hopes that the 'Other' would accept it as a form of discipline and would, indeed, think to itself that maybe it was a personification of some form of go verning body. But as eons of time passed and the 'Other' developed their intellectual powers, they realized that this, again, was our doing and that therefore they had nothing to fear. There would be no reason for change. Their idea of killing and warr ing is to eliminate the One - ness because they have no understanding of the areas that you have become familiar with as \"reincarnation of purification.\" Since they don't undergo this process - they simply stay within the Earth's atmosphere to inhabit a body after a very short time. They think that to eliminate a mind - or eliminate a body - will then eliminate all areas of change and that they will remain the same. INT: Thank you. [Pause] I have one last question, for I believe you are tiring. I keep as king myself, \"Why me? Why me?” VOICE: You seek information of the \"personality.\" We again say to you to look beyond the \"personality\" and the mind. Do you think that you originated within the short space of years you have been alive upon Earth? Your mi nd has been a"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 part of our mind but you decided to use the method of reincarnation as purification. You came back at the time when you will be needed. Do not question as to \"Why me?\" because you question... [Carole's voice rises] ... as to \"personality” ins tead of as to a “Mind”. You are a part of One - ness.

[H?] INT: Are you a personality within the Skull? VOICE: Information... knowledge... understanding with the elimination of a personality, personal beliefs and understanding. Knowledge in one area of your seeking, only. INT: Thank you . That means that if I have to address questions on specific subjects, I would have to address them to specific Entities. Is that true? VOICE: \"Entity\" denotes personality. You would be tapping a \"thought process\" crystallized. There are those who were \"Conductors\" - as you are a Conductor - for this mind. If you were to address this mind [Carole Davis] the personality that you know, and have kinship with, is absent. It was much the same when information was crystallized into this receptacle. We give you the naming detail [Aziah] since it is more understandable to you to have a naming detail. Therefore, at the beginning of each enquiry, you will have a Conductor. This time you have the mind and leadership of the name given: Aziah. But you do not have the personality of this one."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 INT: Thank you. In the first session you talked of the creation of matter... of how the Power of Creation is in the mind. My question is: can this be physically demonstrated, and does the mind \"assemble\" matter - or actually create it? VOICE: The mind is capable of both. But it is easier - in the dimension in which you now have your being - to assemble rather than create. The creation being given from the next dimension. INT: This brings me to a question regarding dime nsions that seems contradictory. You have mentioned that there are only three dimensions and that beyond them there are all the other dimensions. Yet, on other occasions you have mentioned fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh dimensions. Could you elaborate on this and perhaps clarify it for us? VOICE: The dimensions which are particular to the third are those in which creation - creation of thought and collection of thought into matter - takes place. There can be no collection and bringing into matter in an y other dimension... being the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh. There are areas in which no matter can exist. But within the area of first, second, third, matter of different forms can exist - and be perceived by - those whose minds are able to a ccept that this is a fact. INT: We now come to another question concerning \"Time\". If Time is - as you have said - \"an illusion created to control those in the third dimension,\" then what is the process that involves history, the ages of man, birth, li fe and death, stars, planets and other linear - related phenomena in our universe? VOICE: When questioned as to \"Time\" in this phenomenon, we would offer you that you did not perceive. You have an idea of - and you have information passed down - but if yo u would look at it from the perspective of this mind, we would say to you: \"From who, where, what, and how did this information come to you? Do you know it to be viable or, as you would say, Fact\"? Or is it the perceiving of another's mind? "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 We would also offer you the idea that anything in the third dimension has a very limited time span; the understanding of \"Time\" being very difficult for you, and the explanation very delicate since we are cautioned not to overstep the boundaries of \"Permission.\" F or in all things there has to be Permission. Permission being that which you can accept and that which will not disrupt the free will of any individual concerned in the passing on of this knowledge. It is not for us to destroy or disrupt. It is only for us to offer suggestions. When you talk about the \"histories of man,\" do you then determine, by life and death, the true histories of man, or do you think of it in the thought form? As we have offered you, there cannot be a life and death cycle without the cy cle of existence of Mind. We feel there is still an area of misunderstanding... of doubt. We will look further to see if we can clarify it for you. [Pause] Until now, your thoughts upon \"past\" have always been connected to that which you have found of material substance. It is always in looking back that you are able to say, \"Yes, I have been, and I was.\" You do not yet grasp the situation that this material body is a very limited - and self - limiting - controller of mind. We have offered you the tho ught - many times - that your existence has been upon this small dark planet for eons of your Time - Time being a mechanism that was introduced to Mind only - not to spirit or personality - to keep you bound within the perimeters of this dark planet. We of fer you the thought that your origins were \"thought\" in form, and were not of the most positive. As we explained to you, this small dark planet was formed by most of the negative vibrations of other civilizations in other galaxies. We tried to explain furt her that every thought that comes from the \"computer\" known as the Brain goes into your atmosphere. So it is with other planets. Those bodies that began to go though the atmosphere at a slower pace began to build around them an atmosphere of darkness and s o slowed down their vibrations. We offer you that anything that is of pure essence is of extremely fast vibration. Therefore, picture to yourself a creation of a third dimension, and watch it form as it passes through your atmosphere collecting, as it were, all the negative thoughts and forms around it. It then began to slow to such a pace because it"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 66 was bound within that atmosphere. And began to sustain a \"Life form\" - not as you perceive it now, but as we have tried to explain to you. There were thos e of us who felt it was becoming of us then to visit upon this planet and take from it the negativity that we had originally given vent to. INT: With this \"Negative Form\" - the \"Gross Beings\" as you have termed them - is it possible that they \"interming led\" with those of \"One\" in marriage, or in relationships, or what - have - you? VOICE: It is possible - and indeed it was hoped for - but, as is often the way, those of the One are not dominant. They are of gentler persuasion and indeed, their thought patt ern and their vibration are a higher one, and not strictly dominant nor in tune with this planet. So, in these encounters, they are destroyed. In essence, as you would understand it - indeed in their very destruction - they are released, should they requir e release. If not released, then they will return in other \"Forms.\" You have experienced their form in that which you understand as \"music\"... in that which you understand as \"art\"... in that which you understand as \"beauty\". INT: You are saying that an entity can reappear... reincarnate... in these forms? VOICE: I am informing you that the energy created by that \"Entity of One\" - having thus given all to his or her establishment of third form life - can indeed manifest, should it so desire, in that f orm. Or indeed, it may lend itself to another \"form\" for a short duration and then dissipate into - and go to - where it will seek \"itself\" in itself. INT: Is this a form of purification? VOICE: This is a form of purification of vibration that it mig ht exist where it chooses to exist. INT: I would like to ask one other question regarding \"Sleep\". What is \"sleep\"? What is its purpose?"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 VOICE: Education of mind.  INT: All creatures sleep. Are they being educated? VO ICE: All creatures are of One. All is part and parcel of Mind. You will often find it expressed within the human mind, \"They react as an animal will react.\" Indeed, it is sometimes unfortunate that humans will go into the \"state of mind\" of animals and w ill bring back... you would use the word , \"Contamination\". It all stems from the area of Gross Beings. You have also expressed that, within an animal mind, they will behave like a human mind. Indeed, they will borrow from you and they will adopt certain a ttitudes and thoughts and they will behave much as that which they have been imitating. INT: The process of \"Linking\" - as you had requested in an earlier session - has already begun. You had suggested that those who were being 'called' to the Crystal S kull - those of the \"One - ness\" - should \"Link\". We are attempting this linking process and it seems to be working. Are there any other thoughts, information, suggestions or direction, that you can give us regarding this linking process? VOICE: You will understand that those of the \"Minds of One\" are being brought within your vibration. You are not seeking them out actively by the word, you are seeking them by the thought. Therefore, they will make themselves known to you by the word. As we - who are your aid - will say to you many, many times: \"The thought is far more powerful, in your understanding, than the spoken word.\" Indeed, were we to chide you, we would say, \"You think... they speak... and the link is made.\" INT: That is understood. Are ther e any other thoughts you may wish to pass onto us before release? VOICE: We are at peace and you may continue. INT: Is there the Gross Being in all of us?"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 VOICE: The answer is affirmative. INT: Then, in the process of purification, are we atte mpting to resolve this concept with our own Gross Beings? VOICE: The answer is affirmative. INT: What is the difference between your trance - state here - using the Crystal Skull as a receptacle - and any other \"trance - medium\" state? Isn't the same inf ormation accessible whether you are with the Skull or not? VOICE: We have put \"Thought Form\" into pure language within the Crystal Skull. This way it is easier for mind to attach to mind. Indeed, were the right \"Thought Form\" not placed within the area of the Skull it would simply be a work of art. It is our belief that you, within the Third Dimension, need to see, to hear, and to touch. It is then asked that if you eliminate the need to see, to hear, and to touch, then we have proven to the mind - to t he transmitter - that we are such as we claim to be. We are then not needed to put anything within crystalized form. Here you have the essence of computer, and the essence of those which \"program\" and receive the \"program\" and then transcribe it. Yes, we understand your asking, \"Could not the same be done without the receptacle?” But this is where you run into the difficulty of personality and pre - conceived ideas coming into play. Here we are able to overrule the personality and, indeed, pass on inform ation which the personality may disagree with. INT: Is there any religious belief right now that comes close to the ultimate \"Truth\"? VOICE: We seek, and we answer that Love can conquer All. INT: My next question is rather a general one but it co ncerns the \"Occult\" - or metaphysical - aspects in some religions practiced in our world. It seems that some - such as Buddhists, Llamas, and those who practice Yoga - seem to have"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 more control over the physical world than those practicing the more mundane Western religious beliefs. Can you elaborate on this and explain why it is so? VOICE: [The voice takes on a sing - song, oriental tone] Those that seek to control their surrounding of Third Dimension by the power of thought are those that are still able, within the brain and the \"memory banks\" [residual thought], to control matter to a degree... to make it visible or to use it in a tangible force. Those that are still struggling with the conception of mind controlling matter lend themselves to such a relig ious belief. We would also offer you the thought that there are those of you who deliberately undertook to place yourselves in the area of density of the Other in hopes you may be of assistance in educating those around you. Therefore, it is far easier for you to recognize the struggle of other minds when you, yourself, have also experienced it and still are able to understand and feel, that struggling. We offer you a simplification: \"Disguise\". INT: A 'Disguise' of what? VOICE: You will be disguising your true belief and understanding in the guise of being, as it were, \"One\" with \"Another\". But deep within yourself, you will break out of the struggle and this will lead you to find where you truly belong. In other words, those involved in the religions that readily accept the idea of a \"mind\" that can control surroundings, have not chosen to put themselves in jeopardy. For their \"Thought Form\" is not as strong as such as this mind, nor of all minds that we touch within this room. You would be able to ta ke those other minds and beat them until they submitted to your way of belief. However, were you to take this mind [Carole's] and put it into the convention of the religion it was brought up within - and within this lifestyle - it will fight and it will fi ght, and consequently, of course, it will be made stronger and its true understanding eventually will shine forth. For were you to question this mind now, it will tell you, “Mind controls all... and Mind is the link with the One.\" INT: It is my belief at this particular moment that, rather than fight or try and change the minds of the \"Other\", we should concentrate on developing the minds that are of \"One\". Would you like to comment on this?"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 VOICE: This is affirmative. And this is, indeed, why you hav e all been brought together at this time, when this poor unfortunate planet will undergo its dramatic change. For it is well that you chose to scatter yourselves throughout this planet. But now you must find each other to make the \"Silver Chord\". You under stand the \"Silver Chord\"? The Silver Chord of Mind... All joined together. For you will need to surround your planet with an unbroken chain of thought - All of the Mind of One - and then you will be able to lead those that are within darkness. Yes, you mu st all find each other and link with that Silver Chord. [End of Session #5]"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 Session #6 January 15th, 1984 VOICE: [Soft, measured] We are here to assist you. How may we help you? INT: Thank you. My first question concerns \"Vocabulary\". What is th e range of your vocabulary, and is it determined by the mind of the Medium or by those of us brought to you? VOICE: When information was relegated to this receptacle, you must understand, it was not programmed with a vocabulary. It was programmed with p ure information. Therefore, it was processed into a language which would be hidden and concealed until the time when it would be of benefit to those seeking. Therefore, you must understand, that the vocabulary - both in the receiver and to those who would put it into a dimension - was taken into account. [Mantra] INT: My next question concerns ‘Astrology’. Is there any validity to certain claims that stars or constellations can influence either the Gross Beings or those of One? VOICE: We would answer in the affirmative. We would assure you that any and al, heavenly bodies influence those that are now upon this planet Earth. We would answer you thus, and assure you, that any change due to that which is produced in the Third Dimension, and that which is produced without your atmosphere, will, indeed, create a disturbance within the \"vibration\" known to you as \"the body\". And being as how you are \"All as One\" it will certainly affect the mind whether you still hang onto your \"Gross Form\" or whether you are becoming \"Refined\" or returning to that from which you came. And the mind, being the \"Conductor\", will then affect the body, and due to the slightest and"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 smallest amount of change within your atmosphere, all beings will then receive change. We would e xplain further to you ... [Mantra] You must remember that in the beginning this planet did not sustain anything but the \"negative\" vibrations of other planets. You would call them \"thought vibrations\". But this small planet, in its journey across the Outer Hemisphere, slowed to a rate that we, at this understanding, would not have recognized. Therefore, it collected within its atmosphere and became dense. All the negativity that was ushered out of other - as you would call them - planets, or \"life - sustainin g\" globes we took upon ourselves. Because of our compassion - and because of our duty - we entered into this vibration to try to help with the purification or the refining of negativity. It was not the \"Thought - Beings\" who had one Small Dark Planet to collect all negative thoughts that were, at that point in the understanding of \"Time\", floating within one sphere. Indeed, it would have been most dangerous, since then the Crossness of the planet would have turned into itself and caused much disruption. INT: Is this \"negative vibration\" the reason for the Astrological effect? VOICE: We seek here as to your understanding. Yes, this would be in the affirmative, for you will find often that the negative influences are far stronger than the positive one s of other planets of your understanding that would have an effect on your Small Planet, Earth. We then say to you that the \"New Planet\" now moving into your atmosphere [see Appendix #10] is not the one that will assist any Gross Beings. Indeed, you find i t causing a disruption within the mind of present mankind. If he is not reaching out to his finer self then you will find much separation: Man from Man, Woman from Woman, Child from Child, and Land from Sea. And Earth will undertake great changes, even the body of your planet will change as well as your weather as with all to do with Earth as you now know it. Indeed, those that cannot retain the harmony and the high vibration will leave bodies rapidly, to be reincarnated at a later date. INT: What benefi ts or effects do we derive from the experience of purification?"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73 VOICE: While you still retain your body, it is near impossible for you to derive full benefit from \"pure\" emotion for it belongs to a realm not of the Third Dimension. But to experience anyt hing in its pure form is to realize the \"One - ness of All\" If you can experience a pure, pure, pure vibration, then you have experienced it in its entirety and need not repeat the process. [Pause] The emotions do not affect the \"mind\", they are a form of \"s eparation\", something for you to experience, to take away from the thoughts. The thought, always of the body, is \"I Am\"; rather than the \"Mind\" is \"I Am\". They [the thoughts] are, as you understand it, a Key to unlock that which is in Thee. INT: You had said, in the very earliest session, that you, as \"beings\", had visited this Small Dark Planet because of the density of the atmosphere, and that you manifested into material body because you wished to experience emotions. What did you learn from all of th e emotions you experienced? VOICE: Our learning was such because we had not the ability to materialize in the Third Dimension where we were. Indeed, the vibration being, as you would understand, at great speed (in our own planetary atmosphere or dimensi on) made it impossible for us to take on the \"body\". We could not understand how the Gross Beings could not reach the same level of understanding that we had attained. We had, therefore, to reverse the process and understand why it is that you are controll ed so much by the Third Dimension, and why it is you find it impossible to reach up to the \"Thought Forms\". We experienced a separation also: We experienced that which you know as \"birth\" and \"death\". This, to us, was a learning of great value in our a bility to help refine that which we had caused in this Small Dark Planet. It is, within your understanding, necessary to realize that negative thoughts were, at that time and place, something that we had not experienced. INT: What purpose does the form of emotion we call \"laughter\" and \"humor\" serve? What is it, and why is it? VOICE: That which you seek an answer to is, in essence, a lower, slower form of the \"vibration of compassion\". Humor... Laughter... Joy... can be experienced"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 by all beings. The Gross Beings will experience their humor in a negative form, and the Higher Beings will be able to experience their humor in a higher form. Therefore, this will act as a \"Mirror Image\"... Self to Self. But the Gross Beings' humor will only inflict pain upo n another... \"pain\" being that which is known to you as \"embarrassment\", i.e. the embarrassment of another. In fact, \"Gross humor\" will slight the \"ego\". INT: Thank you. My next question is about \"Dreams\". Number one: What is a dream?... and number two: What is the purpose of dreaming? VOICE: We will change to another Conductor [pause] The energy is now sufficient. [In a sing - song voice] We are here... INT: Would you like me to rephrase the question? VOICE: We acknowledge your enquiry. We will t ry to enlighten you. [Pause] We would give you understanding and illustration to that which you call \"sleep\". We offer you this thought: When \"Time\" was introduced into the mechanism of brain to those beings who were to occupy Earth for a short time - or a long time - this state you know as \"sleep\" was also introduced to the mechanism of the brain. Indeed, to each nuclei of each cell was introduced the idea of a \"time - separation\". It was introduced as a safeguard... as a means of control, and as a means of allowing the mind to be relieved of its Third Dimension (state). We will explain further. Sleep was introduced so that you might compensate for that which was done while your mind was within the body. Indeed, the mind continues to learn, to progress, a nd to understand while it is released from the body in a state of sleep. When the body can no longer make the demands upon the mind through the brain, then the mind is freed for an amount of space - \"space and time\". Whilst you are in the condition known a s \"sleep\", you are educated. You are offered the time to repent for that which is done within the space and dimensions of the Third [The \"Matter Space\"]. You are then allowed to progress, should you wish to progress. You will understand this as the areas o f \"Astral Traveling and Learning\". Or, as you would understand, different \"levels\"."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 But, indeed, all levels are One because - once we are out of the Third Dimension of matter - there is no \"Time\". The mind is given free rein with small instruction and it is allowed to settle in a dimension where it is comfortable. It will, indeed, recall past memories known to you now as reincarnational memories, and it will, indeed, travel to that which you would understand as \"forward\" [into the future] in your \"time\" . But, being hat there is no \"Time\", it will simply expand into itself. But we built this mechanism into the “brain - factor” in such a way that it would not... indeed, could not... possibly, affect the Third Dimension in anything other than a positive vein. You will find that, within the time known as \"sleep\", much is learned, much is gained, and much is purified and refined should the mind seek to do so. But in all minds there must be the desire to do so. That which you call \"Genius\" in the Third p lane is, indeed, that mind which is able to bring into the Third Dimension that which it has learned (before), whether it be in an incarnation now or previous. It will bring with it into the time and space all of this knowledge that now exists. You would c all the release of the mind from the body the \"Dreaming - Factor\". Also, at times when the mind is released and free from its encumberment, you will realize that [in answer to the question you posed earlier] it speaks not a language, but [something else] I w ill offer you a thought upon. It is, indeed, a small but very significant idea that language again was given only to this Third Dimension. But we did leave with you a link, other than language, that links [together] all of mankind upon the Third Dimens ion in the small planet, Earth, and, indeed, minds within other galaxies: It is that which you call your \"Music\". For in Music there is [neither] word nor separate language, but all is same when played within the different concepts and understanding of \"mi nd\". Do you understand me? INT: That's a very interesting concept. "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 VOICE: We would also give you further information into that which you are inquiring [regarding] the dimensions of One, Two, and Three. You have asked us how many dimensions there are. We have told you that it is only in the First, Second, and Third. Again, we will emphasize: In those three there can be a change of matter by mind. After that, we offer you this thought which you are to pass onto other enquiring minds, minds which deal wi th numbers. There are no numbers existing after the Third Dimension. Indeed, this was again something given to the \"mind - thought\" to influence the brain because \"number\" denotes Time and Space. It is the language of Time and, after the Third Dimension, the re are no thoughts of numbers. \"Numbers\" deal with Third Dimensional energy... i.e. \"Mind over Matter\"... Matter and Mind and substance... and, after the Third - in the higher realms of concept and thought - there is no such understanding of \"Numbers\". A simplification for you, Enquiring Mind, is that \"Number\" is Time Orientated, therefore, you will have great difficulty in passing mathematical information through this mind, through this brain [Carole's] into the Third Dimensional... [realm] i.e. matter. .. plate... plate matter, matter, matter... the writing... scribing of numbers, for your mathematical information will be most difficult for you to comprehend for, firstly, the mind [Carole's] is not co - operative and, secondly, her brain was not programmed to an understanding of numbers because had it been it would have meant a regression in \"thought - form\", the state we needed to enable her mind to accept other concepts. INT: That answers my next question concerning mathematics. You have answered it in p art but I will pose the whole question in case you have something to add to your answer. What is mathematics? Is it a language, a form of communication peculiar to the Third Dimension only, or does it have also an esoteric connotation, a purpose beyond our comprehension that is \"outside\" our dimension? Is there anything you wish to say about this? VOICE: You will often find that it is expressed in this dimension that certain numbers have a \"Magic\" effect. This is only because the spoken numeral vibrates to [different] levels within the Earth's atmosphere and, by merely being spoken, it will bring about a small energy change."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 INT: May I just recap one thing? As far as \"dreaming\" is concerned... and memory... why is it that some of us have so much difficu lty accessing or recalling all of the information we learn? Whether it be from the dreaming or just in everyday awareness? VOICE: When you ask, \"Why do we have difficulty?\", we answer: \"Why do those have difficulty in discipline? Was it, then, a habit o f bodily form or is it a deliberate attempt to block certain things from this dimension which would not be helpful in your time and space?\" [Pause] You are asking for self? We will examine.... we will examine. [brief pause] We will say that the vibration t hat we feel here, at this time and space, need not concern itself with \"recall\" for, at any given time, that which is considered necessary to remember will be to the front of the conscious mind. The \"conscious mind\" being the level in which you operate at Third Dimension. INT: My next question concerns \"Prayer\". Could you tell us whether the belief, purpose, or use of prayer is anything more than an attempt at communication with what lies beyond the Third Dimension? Is prayer necessary and, if so, how sh ould it be used? VOICE: That which you ask is \"an altering of the State of Consciousness\". Done correctly, it is of benefit to all who feel it. For we would offer you, again, the thought that - done correctly - prayer is a form of \"Love\". It is a form o f \"Energy\" of the most high and the most positive, and very powerful within the Third Dimension. Collectively, done in its purest essence, you would be able to relieve and help all mankind. It is, in a form of prayer, that you will save this planet, fo r it is a linking of \" like - minds\" with One Thought. It is the Concept of One. Much has been said about the use of prayer within your books but we offer you this: That prayer is the \"Thought of One\"... All Minds linking with One Thought to overcome tha t which is Gross and Negative. That is the meaning and the true thought of \"Prayer\". "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 INT: Can it be \"formulated\", or verbalized into a formula? Can prayer be formulated? VOICE: You do not need language for prayer. It is merely the thought. Should you bring into proximity all of those of the \"Minds of One\" - as you will do as you have been guided to do - you will understand then, the meaning of prayer because each and everyone will have One single Thought at the same time. Verbalizing a prayer does no t make it more powerful. Indeed, it takes away from it. INT: In reincarnation, does the \"Soul - Entity\" choose the new body into which it is to reincarnate? If this is so, then is the choice made by race, location, ability, or physical talents of such a c hosen body? Can you elaborate on this? VOICE: It is vibrational. It has nothing to do with the thought you have just expressed. It is simply a case of \"Where does that Third Dimension vibrate within the whole concept of Now, within the concept of Time a nd Space, being that which is Third Dimensional? When you reincarnate into the body, it is often similar to seeing into, as you would understand it, the future. It is like saying, \"And, at a certain time, a certain place, this body will be in this vibr ation, therefore I choose to offer myself, into the service at this particular time. Those which do not have the understanding or, indeed, the desire to be of service, will then incarnate into lower forms, not caring whence or where they are, nor how t hey exist other than they seek to stop and eliminate change. INT: At present, our world, our planet, is undergoing a \"population explosion\". From whence come all of the \"soul - entities\" to inhabit this ever - increasing number of physical beings? Are these Gross Beings... or are they...? VOICE: These are, at the present time, the Gross Beings, for it has been given that they will try to override anything that is pure and good. But as this newly discovered planet comes into effect upon your small Earth, y ou will find them"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 separating. [Urgently] You must take heed! You must quickly gather to yourselves the \"Minds of One\" so that, indeed, if you are not able to override it, you may put \"balance\" back within the Earth. For remember, the negative forms are able to separate far more easily than the Higher Forms. INT: Can more than one \"soul - entity\" occupy the same body at the same time? VOICE: It is possible. It does not occupy the body, it shares the mind. You call it \"of split mind\". I will find the word... Schizophrenia ... the splitting of a mind. INT: The \"Splitting of a Mind\" - these different personalities - are they in constant conflict with the body? VOICE: Within the mind and within the brain. Yes, they are in constant conflict. Each see ks to dominate, for the Gross Being's purpose is to dominate completely! INT: Are all the \"soul - entities\" [in the case of schizophrenia] Gross Beings? VOICE: That which seeks to dominate is always Gross. That which seeks to harmonize and balance is o f \"One\". INT: Then the question is: Is it possible for the Gross, and the \"Entity of One\", to occupy the same mind at the same time? VOICE: Not at the same \"time\"... but to seek to occupy the mind. For it was hoped, indeed, by joining with the Gross Beings, as explained to you, we would help them in their \"progression\". So, always and forever, we seek to offer. But many of us have become weak and left the Earth for another Dimension because it was impossible to continue being separated. Indeed, as you would say, our energy levels were depleted to such an extent whereby we had to return, much as you saw this mind, in the beginning of this session, struggling for energy to free itself from the body that we might contact you. So it is with the mind and wi th the body, and without this energy input the mind and body is still. "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 INT: In this particular dimension, there seems to be great competition between people; personality clashes, \"ego trips\", greed, etc. Could you give us some insight into the reason be hind this? VOICE: The challenging of Beings... the challenging of Minds. It is because they seek to dominate. We have warned you that the Gross Beings will seek to dominate even in the smallest area, be that area known to you as \"vocabulary\" or conversa tion. Always a Gross Being will seek to dominate. Where discipline is used, refinement begins, and attempts to remove the negative and the Crossness from the planet Earth. INT: In a similar context, I now ask about \"exorcism\"... our Western Church's met hod of \"Casting out of Demons\". Is this merely a primitive form of psychology or does it have validity? VOICE: [Long pause] We understand your seeking. We would offer the thought thus: That anywhere that the Mind of One seeks to release from domination you will find that there is a purpose behind it. But we offer, also, a caution: We would ask, \"In what area does this Mind seek to be released? Where does it go when it is released? And who commands this Thought Form?\" We offer thus: That whenever any negative Thought Form - whether it be generated by Gross Beings or by the Finer Mind - is released into your atmosphere, if it cannot escape due to the density of this planet, it will seek its home in another Mind. INT: You mentioned, in a previous s ession, that there is the possibility of an Entity coming back in the form of music, or art, etc. Is the creation of any art form... be it music, sculpture, painting, choreography, etc... formed by a part of an Entity's soul? Is it a part of their own \"sel f or \"being\"? VOICE: It is part of the energy of the Mind, yes. And, therefore, once given into the Third Dimension as music or art, it cannot be used again. Therefore, we would seek to create anew. "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 INT: Could you take that a little further? I don't fully comprehend. VOICE: Once that particular energy is given, it is given and cannot be drawn again. [Pause] We will seek further. [Pause] Once the Entity has manifested Itself in a piece of music, that music stays within the realms of the Third. It ca nnot be used again. It is considered a form of energy completely spent. Therefore a new energy must be drawn from \"without\" - from the \"Highest Form\" - from that which you call \"The Creation\"... the God Force... The Vibration. And therefore it will take eo ns of your time to manifest again. INT: Can you answer a question on \"Healing\" or do I need another Conductor for this information? VOICE: We are with you still. We will give you the other Mind. INT: Thank you. Tell me when you are ready. VOICE: [Carole spins Skull rapidly on turntable] We will continue. INT: Thank you. This question concerns \"Healing\". Can \"Sound\", or another form of vibration, be used to physically alter, reassemble, or otherwise repair the human or animal body? Can it be u sed to regenerate limbs, organs, etc.? VOICE: Affirmative. And, indeed, the magnetic fields, when understood, will also produce this phenomena. Because all of your physical self vibrates with different \"sounds\", as you understand it, and also on a diffe rent magnetic field, you merely have to change or seek out the use of the electrical conductor, and the use of a magnetic attraction, and you will find that you are able to manufacture a change within the body. Indeed, this information is also being gi ven to some people right now. We tell you to seek within your medical field and you will find that this is already happening with the disease, or disharmony, known as the \"Cancerous Condition\". Indeed, the blood, the very life system of your body, can be m uch affected by sound. The bone structure can be healed, or disrupted, by the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 various use of sound. The brain itself can be destroyed or enhanced by the use of sound vibration, whether or not it is audible or inaudible. Indeed, those that would seek destru ction upon your planet are presently using this form. INT: Thank you. I will check this out. [see Appendix #11.] VOICE: This is being used from without this planet. That which circles the planet Earth [Satellites?] is being used to bombard the planet with different vibrational levels, calling on the mind and body and brain to produce strange and, as yet, unheard of disease. You will find your marine life is undergoing great change. It will be said that you have affirmed the discovery of that which is most large of beasts within the ocean [whales?]. We offer you the thought that that which is being bombarded upon the planet Earth is causing an outgrowth of life. You must be warned of such. You are killing marine life, and you are causing that which is Gross and would destroy your life system, to become more abundant upon the Earth. You are killing off your vegetation which gives ease to the ethereal body. You are allowing the Gross Beings, again, to dominate. For each and every part of your planet is to be used for the cultivation, and purification. Gross Beings are not unintelligent and understand that if you have nothing to liken yourself to - or to enhance your spiritual being by - then you will be bound tightly to the Earth. INT: That is under stood. As a matter of fact, it brings me to my next question: Life survives by taking the lives of other living things... animals and vegetables. Could you offer some insight into this \"chain - of - life cycle\"? Is it, for example, wrong to kill and eat animal meat? VOICE: It is not \"wrong\" but, as you progress through your purification process, you will find that it is not necessary. It is programmed into the brain - the mind - that it is necessary, but you will find now, as your enlightenment continues, t hat there are those who do not find it necessary to sustain their life with this form of \"flesh\" sustenance. "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 INT: Is there \"life\" on other planets in our planetary system? By \"life\", I'm talking about Third Dimensional \"physical\" life. VOICE: It can be brought about in a Third Dimensional form now. They have an understanding of how to materialize and will, indeed, try to show \"themselves\" to you in a way that is recognizable to you. INT: Is this within our planetary system? I'm talking about our o ther planets, such as Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, etc. VOICE: This is within your planetary system. Up until the time in which we found this receptacle [the Crystal Skull] it has been continuing. But, then again, it has been unrecognized. INT: What \"form\" does this life take? VOICE: It can adapt to any form. It can create that which it finds itself wishing to copy: \"Like - to - like\". It can create a form similar to yourself - maybe not exactly to the details which you seek - but it will be in a form which you can recognize as humanoid. Yes, there is a \"being\" [life form]. INT: Thank you. May I... [Carole begins spinning the Skull rapidly on the turntable]. VOICE: This mind must be released.....! INT: Very good. VOICE: This mind mu st be released...

VOICE: Information relayed to you in these circumstances is \"Truth\" known to us. Your concept of truth may be colored by your environment in your mind and space at this time. We ask you to verify all information to the best of your abilities. We ask you that you will seek in depth the truth that is given through this receptacle. We do not ask you to blindly go ahead believing that all given word is not subject to investigation. INT: Thank you. My next question is regarding \"Intelligence\"... VOICE: If there should be any area where you find investigation difficult, then seek a further explanation and we will tell you where, in your time and space, you may seek verification. INT: Understood. The next questi on is regarding \"Intelligence\". First, can you define \"Intelligence\", and, second, what other animal, or mammal, has an I.Q.? VOICE: The definition of the word \"Intelligence\" would seem to be the ability to use knowledge for the benefit of \"self and \"m an - kind\" in the time and space you now find yourself residing. You ask us what other animal life would receive"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 intelligence, and we ask you to look at your animal life. Do they not exhibit a time and understanding of brain as to \"where\" they are? This woul d seem, then, to be \"Intelligence\" as you would understand it. You look to the animal life that you created upon this Small Dark Planet and you will find that nothing that surrounds their energy gives any idea as to a relationship which is not of benefit t o their self and to those that are in kinships with them. The plants, the life you have created, the animal life you have created, and even those of feathers [birds]. INT: You have said that a \"dream - state\", or sleep, is a means of educating... VOICE: A state of altered consciousness which allows the mind free rein to manufacture, and create, because knowing that the next existence is \"Thought Created\", we allow you time to amend wrongs. We allow you time to refine. We allow you time, as you understan d it, to be released from body substances, to have free rein so that you, with your intelligence, can create a \"time\" and a \"frame\" for the mind. We ask you, also, to understand that the existence of creation through \"thought form\" is very real. Even n ow it is beginning to be understood by those who are on this Small Dark Planet. We ask you to ponder the thought that, if it is so that mind can create matter, is it not better that that Mind, which can create matter, be refined during a time that it is no t attached to body substance? INT: Yes. But animals sleep also. Are they also being educated during sleep? VOICE: They are being refined to a state of \"acceptance\". INT: Acceptance? By whom? VOICE: By the Creation. You must understand that all animal life, all plant life, all life, all Third Dimension matter is a creation of the Minds of One. Anything that is beauty to the eye is a creation of the Minds of One. Animals are simply a creation of the Minds of One and, when they detach from the bod y in an altered"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 state, or sleep state, they are merely collecting energy to allow them to sustain their material bodies. If you understand that their creation is of your mind then, by their changing vibration, they will collect energy that will enable them to retain a material body until such time as they are destroyed. INT: What is \"Thought\"? Is it a form of electromagnetic energy? VOICE: It is a form of energy. We do not understand your wordings of \"electromagnetic\". It is a form of energy. INT : What is \"Magnetism\", then? VOICE: We will seek further to your understanding of magnetism. [Pause] You talk about the effects of \"waves\" upon the Small Dark Planet that are created by other planets, by your Moons and your Suns. We answer you that it is only a denser form, a misconstrued Intelligence of, again, the form of energies. INT: You have used the term \"Magnetism\" yourself in past sessions. \"The Magnetic Fields\". VOICE: This is a wording belonging to this Mind [Carole's]. When used for v erification, of \"how\" and \"what is it\", it is foreign to our nature. INT: Alright, we will come back to it and ask another Intelligence at a later date. Can you answer as to how matter is formed? VOICE: Matter is formed in various ways. You would see k the answer that matter is formed by the vibration of thought upon this Small Dark Planet? We would answer thus: A collection of thoughts in purest form under one Mind's direction - the same as your lasers, activated by the excitement of light and sound - can, when given one particular thought, with purity and without interference from other realms that surround this planet, create a form of matter. "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 Indeed, that which you understand, your scientists are now bringing about. They are exciting that which y ou do not see with light and sound and are creating a Third Dimensional matter. You have such an example in the form of disease. It is not seen, it is not felt, but it will demonstrate itself upon the body to such an extent that it will destroy. You call t his \"Cancerous Material\". INT: You've mentioned that \"vibrations\" determine the difference between various sources of Intelligence. You have used such terms as \"Finer\", \"Faster\", and \"Slower\" Vibrations. Could you tell us what you mean by this? VOICE: A \"vibration\" is the ability of the mind to attune itself to that which does not surround its density. It is a seeking out of a higher plane. INT: Can these vibrations be measured by any Third Dimensional device? VOICE: We will seek further. [Paus e] That is affirmative. INT: Can you describe such a device for us? VOICE: You will see a positive demonstration of this vibration upon... substance...Substance? ... Film!... Film!... Film! You will also be able to measure this vibration with so und. Indeed, that which is sensitive to sound, which your Scientists now use in \"creative\" warfare, will be able to pick up this vibration. Hence, we have advised in times before that it should be looked for in your Houses of Government, for those who seek to destroy will send a \"thought form\" vibration which can be picked up. But the frequency is not as you now know it... [The Voice holds on the last word, \"it\", and continues to hold the note for some time] INT: Thank you, we'll come back to this la ter. How fast is \"Thought\"? "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 VOICE: Again, you ask us to define \"Time and Space\" which we have constantly told you is extremely difficult. What do you seek from this? INT: We want to know whether \"Thought\" is instant, whether it is faster than light, for example. VOICE: Light refractions are slower than the vibrations of pure thought. But we would again advise you that it is only in the Minds of One that you get \"pure thought\". INT: The next question is regarding \"Permission\". You used the term \" Permission\" before and it seemed to me that you were, perhaps, referring to the \"Knowledge\" that is forbidden to those in the Third Dimension. Could you elaborate on what you meant when you said, \"We must have permission\"? VOICE: When the Council was br ought together to crystallize the thoughts and the knowledge [into the Receptacles], it was not clearly defined as to the \"Time and Space\" in which the crystallized knowledge would be divulged. We were only able to feel the calamities and the growing dense ness of the planet. In addition, as we have cautioned you [in Session #6], the minds of the Other are equally \"Intelligent\", as you would term it. However, the built in safety factors seem to have governed them to this point. Therefore we sought to 'scan' this time and this space to see if this was the time to release the knowledge. INT: Does this have any bearing on the \"Garden of Eden\" story of the Apple from the Tree of Knowledge? VOICE: Symbol... symbolistic. [pause] Verification. INT: May we g o to the next question? Insanity takes many forms. Can you give us some insight into this Third Dimension phenomenon? Give us some of the \"Why's\" and \"Wherefore's\" of this terrible affliction that strikes certain members of the human race. "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 VOICE: You ta lk about the disease of the mind. Again we say to you: There are various factors affecting the function of the mind which will produce strange phenomena within that computer known to you as \"Brain\". We would say to you that the very atmosphere around this planet would give rise to a great deal of insanity. We ask you to define which insanity you would like further instruction upon. INT: The sort of insanity, perhaps, that makes people... VOICE: Do you talk of physical issues? Or do you talk of emoti onal issues? Or do you talk of spiritual issues? INT: Well, isn't insanity a form of all three? VOICE: Yes, it is affirmative. It is the wrong working of energy of mind. If you were to see the energy that causes insanity... [Carole reaches out her ha nd and bangs the table] Give this mind... this body... that which will communicate. [Bangs table again] [Realizing that Carole is asking for paper and a pencil, the Interviewer passes her both and puts them beside her on the table top]. INT: It is besid e you, there. VOICE: You would find that the energies, instead of dissipating and joining with collective forces of positive nature, will, indeed, leave the computer and re - circle upon itself causing electrical malfunction. [Carole drew a rough sketch t o illustrate a source of energy circling back on itself] INT: You mean \"short - circuiting\" the system. [Pause] You've mentioned that Sound is part and parcel of the process of Healing. Has there ever been a sound produced on this Earth that can be called a \"Healing Sound\"? Have we reached this technology in any way, shape or form... whether it be by human voice or mechanical means? "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 90 VOICE: Yes, it has been produced. Indeed, there are those that are of the level of sub - sound...ultra - sound... and \"diagno stic\" sound [who] can prove to be of healing benefit to substance [body]. But the “Mind” in this room [ he said, referring to singer, Keath Barrie - see Appendix #12. ] will be used to heal mind, for the mind is a governing factor of body. But you will se e the disappearance of growths when this mind is used in conjunction with sound. INT: In the process you call \"Separation\"... between the Third Dimension and your dimension [death]... is there a form of \"Judgement\" or \"Evaluation\" as to the behavior of each entity during their period on Earth? Is there a form of judgement at the point of death and, if so, by what Authority? VOICE: There is not that which you understand as \"judgement\". There is, rather, the collection of all past lives of the finer vib ration, and a review of that which has been omitted. It is shown to the entity. All Personalities are collected at the time known to you as \"transition of death of the body\". And those that seek to refine themselves will indeed move on to the next dimensio n - to that which will bring about refinement and purification. There is no one who sits in “The Seat of Judgement\". Or, if there is one, let it be thought of as the \"Mind of One\". This is what is demonstrated when it is thought of a \"Personality of One\". But [even] this is a misconstrued idea, for it is a \"Mind of One\", not a \"Personality of One\"! INT: We understand. Are you still at \"peace\"? VOICE: We are at peace. INT: I'd like to ask for more information regarding the \"Twin Planetary Systems\" you spoke of before. Can you give us this information, or do we require another Conductor? [see Appendix #10] VOICE: You would seek another mind. INT: Can you pass us onto that Mind without too much effort? "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 VOICE: [Mantra.... Long pause]. Where do you seek? INT: What I seek is information on the \"Twin Systems\"... the \"Twin Planetary Systems\". You have said in the past that these Systems were, \" In opposition to our Galaxy and not yet discovered\". Could you elaborate on this please? VOICE: At this time of being we find that - within your time and space - you are beginning to seek further into that which you have knowledge of. These are the \"holes\" that you seek to call \"dense\" [Black Holes]. What you do not yet perceive is that this is a form o f protection to you and, once you have destroyed that protection which you are on the threshold of doing, you will discover that there are negative planetary forces. You have also, at this time and space as we understand, beheld a somewhat... the plane t which we told you existed but that you then had no knowledge of. You will find that this planet is not of benefit to this Earth. Indeed, you are creating around this planet such a dense barrier that anything of the finer vibration that would be brought a bout by the discovery of the \"Twin Moon\", will indeed be overrun with negativity. INT: What do you mean by \"Twin Moons\"? You have mentioned them before. What is it that you are calling the \"Twin Moons\"? VOICE: There is, within your system.... INT: Our planetary system? VOICE: ...a planetary system not yet known. Yes, it is known, but not yet released to a public mind, that there exists the planet [known as] \"Twin Moon\". You will soon have communication in written word that this system, and this planet - this moon - exists. [see new discovery in Appendix #10] INT: Is the space that exists between molecules of matter the same 'space' in other dimensions? "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 VOICE: No, this is not correct because, in other dimensions, you do not have \"matter\" a s it is known to this mind. INT: What is \"space\", then? VOICE: \"Space\" is a word - form given to something you do not yet understand. It is that dimension in which Sound and Light can exist freely, as can pure thought. It is, indeed, under these condit ions - should you be able to create Life with Sound and Thought - that you will be able to accomplish it. INT: That contradicts our knowledge of physics. To have \"sound\" one requires the density of an atmosphere. Can you elaborate on this? VOICE: Wit hin the Earth's atmosphere there is sound that is audible to the body. But in the outer – outward - atmosphere there is \"sound\" that exists in pure form. INT: That's a very interesting concept. [Pause] We come to the next question concerning \"Miracles\". The raising of the dead, for instance, [turning] water into wine, etc. Can you explain this and perhaps give us some insight into it? VOICE: That which you understand as a \"World of Miracles\" is simply a demonstration of Mind controlling matter. Not ha rd to understand in light of information we have given previously, for what is a \"miracle\" but an instant changing of a \"material\" condition? Minor miracles are happening within this context, within this room. INT: Yes, that we understand. [Pause] Wit h inter - galactic travel... VOICE: There is great danger! We are waiting... INT: Waiting? VOICE: [Whispers something unclear] "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 INT: Please, give us the details. VOICE: [Loudly] We must release this mind due to stress upon the body...

[End of Session #7]"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 Session #8 March 18th, 1984 [After a few preliminary observations regarding possible future events, Carole slips into the trance state and, after a mantra, begins to speak]. VOICE: We... hear... you... hear... you. [Mantra grows louder] We hea r you. INT: When you are at peace, I would like to ask the first question. VOICE: [Mantra] Begin your communication. INT: The first question concerns the \"New Age\" - or the coming \"New Age\" - and preparation for the coming disasters. According to what you have told in the past about the forthcoming worldwide cataclysm, etc., it seems that these events will necessitate a great deal of preparation by those who will be playing different roles in the future. We want to know how these people will be ch osen or selected. VOICE: There is no \"selection\" as you understand it. Those that will be needed in areas of guidance have already begun their incarnation. There are those that have remained without the Third Dimensional incarnation in the other dimensi on in order to learn of their roles and their abilities. They are incarnated now as \"Elders\". They are incarnated now as yourselves. And even those that will come [next] are incarnated into younger levels, younger minds. You must understand that the \"col lective mind\" will be the governing factor, not the individual mind. Therefore all minds, at the present time, are being attuned to seek out each other. And it is only when this is complete that you will be able to be of assistance to your fellow man. "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 The selection, as you describe it, began when we were aware of the Earth's destruction and the other forces which we did not overcome in the time of our incarnation upon the Earth plane. It is difficult for you to understand that a \"Governing\" body will no t be one person, but a selection of different minds. They are already aware of the situation for, throughout the Universe, they will all come together. Not in a rush of time, but in time that is easy and gentle to your understanding. Even now you are i n communication with those without [outside] your Universe who would assist you in your education of Minds, and will assist to put right that which is negative and that which is a force of Crossness [cross purposes] among those upon the Earth plane. Th e \"education\", as you determine it, is not as we determine it. There is knowledge still within the mind of each, and each will unlock each other’s mind. Within the brain, the \"computer\" of the Third Dimensional body, is all the knowledge that you have sust ained through past incarnations, and through that time when you decided to return to assist with the rebirth of this Small Dark Planet. You must think of this time - this age that you are in - as a time before birth, not the time of destruction of same , for there will be a rebirth after the time of mourning. INT: Recent news reports have told of the magnetic reversal... VOICE: [Abruptly] My name is Daktur. I am your Communicator. How may I help you? INT: Thank you, Daktur. Our newspapers are now telling us about the forthcoming Magnetic Pole shift in our Earth's plane. Is this a prelude to the predicted cataclysm and, if so, can you give us - in Earth years - an approximate idea of when this will take place? "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 96 VOICE: Mmmmmmm... Time!... Time! ... Time!... Time! We will seek further... time... time... time. Two... Two... zero... zero... five. Two zero zero five! INT: The year Two thousand and five? [2005?] [see Appendix #13.] VOICE: There will be, at that time, a disaster that is of great consequence but, in essence, your \"disaster\" as you term it, has already begun. You must remember that the mind of the Gross Being is subtle, also. The negative forces would be easily recognized were they to come with a greater disaster, but they seek to subtlety destroy. INT: This \"destruction\" has happened before in our Earth plane. Presumably such as in the case of Atlantis. Is this correct? VOICE: This is affirmed. INT: What can you tell us about Atlantis?  ' VOICE: That which you call \"Atlantis\" was, in fact, the \"State of One Mind\". You, in your understanding, have translated it into a \"being\", a \"place\"... a \"Time\". In actuality, this was a \"State of Mind of Oneness\". INT: But where did it exist? You have spoken of its destruction, and also of it rising up again - out of the Atlantic - off the coast of Bimini. This would indicate that... VOICE: Bimini is a land mass where a great storehouse of knowledge was kept. This was the centralization of the crystal life. This was, as you would determine it, the heart and the very being of the \"Minds of One\". Therefore we thought to hide the knowledge within one place only. However, it was then decided that that idea was also one of a dangerous nature; that it would be better to distribute the \"Minds of One\" in various areas [receptacles]. The receptacles would be activated, and present themselves when your Earth was in need, as is happening at this time and in this place. We would tell you that there will be m any areas of land masses that you have come to know as"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 97 Atlantis, but your concentration should be in the area of the crystals that were the recording devices of the Minds of One. We have given you this area several times. However, we would seek once more t o define \"Atlantis\" - as you have understanding [of it] - not as a Place, but as a \"Mind\": A \"State of the Mind of One\". INT: What happened after the destruction of this \"State of the Mind of One\" ... of Atlantis? VOICE: There was great splitting of the Earth, and the energies were dissipated therefore we could not control them. There were those Gross Beings who had learned and had knowledge, as we had knowledge, but they sought then to have a controlling factor, and they sought then the negative influences. And, you must understand, that because the force of energy has no conscience to it, those that sought to dominate were able to take this energy and, by the use of it, were indeed able to use it for governing, controlling, and acting as the con trolling force, using it as that thought you have of the concept of \"God\". However, this was not appropriate for this was not the understanding we had wished it to be when we came to this planet, therefore our \"One\" energy was countered by the \"Other\" Gross energies. As a result of this, your Earth was fissured and split. The very planet - your self - same Earth - issued forth and would not allow such \"beings\" to control it. We thought then to leave. And you, also, were there and at that time sought a lso to leave to wait an incarnation where you would be able to help your fellow man. You have asked what happened to the physical body of the Earth? From within the Earth the magnetic field also shifted, as they are shifting now... one positive vibrati on, one negative vibration, with the result that your Earth was split asunder, the discharge of which wandered through the Earth and into the atmosphere. Land masses disappeared, seas and oceans rose up and the very"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 98 atmosphere itself was in a state of nega tive pollution. And many so - called \"Third Dimensional\" lives were taken, never to reincarnate again. At the time of the eclipses you will notice the strange effects upon your Earth. Many of these so - called \"souls\" are released into the atmosphere at th is time so that they might return to their \"home\". You will also notice that at the time of the eclipses of the sun many \"New Souls\" are permitted to enter into Third Dimensional life. It is at this time that the Earth suffers great damages because the Uni verse issues out only those negative vibrations, and the Gross Beings seek a dense planet on which to incarnate. So we tell you that what you are doing with your sounds and light manifestations is causing the Earth to form an \"eclipse\", and the shield around it then becomes dense and acts like a magnetic field to all those \"souls\" that are of the negative quality. Do you understand? INT: Yes, I do. A short while ago, I had a thought that if the Gross Beings wished to invade this planet they could do it simply by coming as newborn children. Could you comment on this? VOICE: Your understanding of \"Child\" would be a \"New Soul\". We have already given you the answer: At the time of a Solar Eclipse all ‘New Souls’ will enter into the Third Dimensional l ife as that which you call a ‘Child’. INT: Then those are the Souls of the Gross Beings? VOICE: These are Gross Beings. These are the \"negatives\" from other life forms, other galactic civilizations still to be discovered. INT: Thank you. We have , in all of us, multiple personalities or life stages. First the \"baby\", then the \"child\", youth and adult. Are all of these within the one being in a \"progressive state\", or are they always within the being from beginning to end? . VOICE: They are alwa ys within the being."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 INT: Please elaborate. VOICE: If you would seek you would find that the Mind seeks constantly to run from itself, \"Self” being the \"All\" one knows. You will see that the Mind, the personality, the brain, gives unclear permission - gives understanding - for each of us to leave responsibilities to the other Child. You will see, also, that the Mind uses the young adult as the excuse for experimentation... for need to seek out., or for \"Thought Form\" to break away from the convention al understanding. And then the Mind progresses to the state of the older, of the mature person, where it then realizes within itself the \"One - ness\". Through all of this they still retain the means by which they can \"leave\" to other dimensions. In each of t he \"Others\" there is a Gross Being, and they must use their own Minds in the struggle to overcome. We would suggest that those of you brought here to the Crystal Skull have undergone the battle and the war against the Grossness of your own Being, and have won, and are now able to return to the State of Grace of \"One - ness\" to seek further purification of self and same. INT: Thank you. [Pause] Disembodied energy - i.e. that which manifests as ghost or poltergeist, etc. What can you tell us about this for m of energy and its' manifestation? VOICE: It is a form of energy that clings to the personality of the body; therefore it is very close to the next dimension of life. If you would think three and three one halves, you would have the correct energy fiel d. INT: Three and three halves? VOICE: Three... half.... four... You will receive information very shortly - in your time and understanding - concerning the place of the Earth we wish you to look at this in depth.

How may we assist you? INT: It has been a long time. Greetings. When you are at peace, I will ask my first question. VOICE: You may proceed. INT: This is to be the ninth and final session for the book, \"The Skull Speaks\". Many questions have arisen from out of the material you have given us, and the one that seems to be most often asked regards your prediction of the turning of the Earth's axis. Is it inevitable, or can it be averted through the power of combined thought and prayer? VOICE: You must realize that the axis of this small pl anet you call your Earth has already started its variation. You misunderstand the word \"shifted\". We offer you the word that it is, and has started to vary its original and known position, but to clarify even more clearly, we would say that the axis of yo ur Earth will change in vibration rather than to change position. Which, understood in your terms, we would say, will bring about changes to both those upon Earth in the form of the \"human\" and that form you know as vegetation... and that form which you kn ow as land mass, and that form you know as atmosphere. INT: Can this be changed by the use of thought and single - minded concentration [to which] you give the name of \"Prayer\"? "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 101 VOICE: This cannot be changed. It can be understood and, therefore, need n ot have such a negative form as will be given it. All thought is given to the changes in this vibration. We offer you a further example: If it is known there is to be, as you would call it, a calamity or a change in the terrain of your Earth - and you advised those [who might be] affected by the change - would not those that understood and listened to the word then be safe? INT: Not necessarily. In the event of earthquake or volcanic activity, dark dust clouds might blot out the sun thereby causing a universal change in the atmosphere. This is what people fear. Can this be prevented or averted? VOICE: This can be averted to some extent because, if it is known at what time, and whence and hence the so - called calamities will take place, then you will be given information as to how to diversify the energy. Therefore, it may not be concentrated in the power to cause calamity. Should you expect a volcanic disruption of your Earth, then you would be given ways to divert the energies whereby the volcanic d isruption would be rendered far smaller in degree than otherwise. Left to itself, it would override all that is within its power. We talk here of the energy of matter. We offer this thought to you: Energy understood, is energy controlled. Therefore, s hould you seek to have control of energy for this small planet then you'll have the knowledge to divert any great catastrophes. Only those of \"like - minds\" will be given this information. Those that do not seek to heed this information will then forfeit wit h their Third Dimensional lives. INT: Are others receiving this \"channeled\" information? VOICE: There are many receiving this information. Those that are of the \"Minds of One\" - those that were with the original Council - have now reincarnated at thi s time to receive and to join together to share information. "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102 INT: Some of the information we are receiving through other Channel sources is contradictory to the information you are giving and is, also, contradictory to information from yet other Channel sources. How can we determine which is correct? VOICE: You must look to the past to see which information has been, for the most part, correct. And, also, to that which has given you information well in advance of events. INT: What do those of the \"One\" have to look forward to in the future? VOICE: The future, as you would perceive it, would be an Earth of harmony with Nature and with that which you have created. Compatibility with each Soul, and a world striving for knowledge - other than intell ectual knowledge - that will come to you from other sources. You must realize, at this point, that you are not alone in your Universe. [This being so, then] how can you expect to link with other minds while your main thoughts are of suspicion, destruction , and a high regard for self? INT: This is very true, but a lot of what we know is based on information that is being channeled - not just through this source - but from other sources as well. VOICE: You must realize that in all there is a balance. W e never have said - nor will we ever say - ours is the only source of information. You must be the Conductor now, as you were before, and you must seek that which is truth - the grain of truth - in all essence. INT: That is understood. There is mention, from another Channel source, regarding the exponential powers that can be created through the linking of minds. Mathematically, they are referring to the \"square of the number\" of people who might be using positive thought or prayer at any given time. For example, the square of 250 people praying would be the equivalent power of 62,500 people. I don't want to complicate the question, but is this what you meant when you said, \"We are small in number but Vast in Mind\"? "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 103 VOICE: This was not understood by yo u. It is not the number, for numbers belong to the Third Dimensional, critical brain function. We offer you another source of understanding, the \"Time\" and the \"Number\". When a mind links with a body for this \"time\", the brain is programmed with a safeguar d. This safeguard is known to you as \"Time\", and Time related to you is numbers. We offer to you that number and time has no depth, it is not a living vibration, it is merely the vibration of the now and the mind for now. It is built into the brain to cove r and to command that which the body will follow. We offer you a further explanation: The mind of this channel [Carole] knows not the understanding of number and time. If you were to understand it, it is - you would say in your time - a dysfunction of the brain. You will find there are many who work in the realms of the Fourth and other dimensions who do not have an understanding of time, figures and measure [for to them] all are one and the same. They [numbers] are flat, they have no life... they are p erpetual. They are a vibration that is strictly geared to the mind - a computer of \"now\". They are a function, not of mind, but of brain, and mind has difficulty in understanding the use of numbers and the related exercises pertaining to number and phase. We are going to offer you the use of the mind of one who was great in research in this field. You have a name for him and he will make himself known to you as time goes on. He lived in your Earth's atmosphere while the understanding of time and space w as so important to you, and he will explain the relativities, number, space, and time... as a function of brain related only to the Third Dimension. It is not a viable form of vibration and cannot be released. It is locked into that which you perceive as n ow. INT: At what time in the future will this \"entity\" show himself? VOICE: When your research and studies are in place, you will have minds that will be brought to link with his, for they will understand the way of his passing on of information. IN T: Thank you. That is understood. Next question: Is Nuclear Warfare inevitable, or can it be prevented by...?"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 104 VOICE: [Emphatic] There will be no nuclear warfare! This, again, is a disguise of the Third Dimension. [Imploring] We urge you...! We urge yo u...! Do not see with your eyes... listen with your mind! Do not listen with your ears... listen with your mind! It is not the enemy you perceive when you hear of these dangerous consequences, it is the false voice from within yourself. INT: That is in valuable to us. [Pause] You have said, in the past, that there is a New Planet moving into our atmosphere that will cause much separation: Man from Man... Woman from Woman... Child from Child... and Land from Sea. What exactly is this new planet? Is it a meteor or what? VOICE: The new planet... it is in direct opposition to your Earth. It is already known to many. However, because their understanding is not of the right kind, there is still much hidden from them that we are trying desperately to control and keep away from them. [see Appendix #10] This new planet is much like your Earth. It is not a Meteorite. It is definitely - and will become definitely - substance similar to your Earth. But its vibration upon the small Earth will be that to separat e. You have already felt its influences. [Pause] We will check to see the influences felt. [Another pause] The influences felt at this time are violence. [see Appendix #14] Much violence is occurring within your planet. Violence amongst men: violence amon gst the earth, eruptions and disruptions of weather patterns... separating of atmospheres. You will find that those souls that are entering your space are already aware of separation. You will say that its pull and effect upon the mind and the brain of the Gross Beings will be that of much violence and separation. Brother will kill brother, mother will kill child, and child will kill parent. Each will turn against itself. You will find much death amongst your life upon the planet. You will find that that wh ich is grown in the ground will cause much change, and you will see that that which feeds upon the ground will end up with much death. You will, from there, experience pestilence. In the coming years you will experience much pestilence in that which flies (birds) upon your planet. INT: Can this be negated? If so, how?"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 105 VOICE: You already have much evidence of this having taken place. Again, with the understanding of, and with the knowledge of, the energy patterns, all can be controlled. You cannot nega te, but you can control. And, surely, that which you can control can be used to more positive purposes. Your waters will rise where they should not rise and your land will be sinking under that which you call, \"Strange Weather Patterns\". You will have much wind which will shift the earth. Your livestock will die in great numbers . [see Appendix #14] Yes, you could control all of these were you of like - mind to do so. Therefore the urgency you felt yourself in the mind, Conductor, is that which we put fort h to bring to those of the Minds of One. At least, by this time, they should be in control. INT: Thank you. As you are no doubt aware, I have edited a great deal of material from this manuscript in the belief that the world may not be ready for it at th is time. Also, I have done it because we need absolute confirmation of some of the material that has been received. Do you wish to comment on this decision? VOICE: Since you are in the dimension that is of the \"now\", we have guided you as much as we are able. Of course, the final decision must lie within your mind. But we do not fear. We see, within your mind, all reincarnational knowledge awakening... your awareness is not a necessity, it is that which is in your mind. And, having once served as a Condu ctor, [wherein] you received information from other minds, we are confident that you will release the information as you feel necessary. INT: Thank you for the trust. We wish to undertake a search for the place where the Crystal Skull was made. It is i mportant to us that the knowledge of early prehistoric civilizations be specifically established as far as the background of the Skull is concerned. Can you help and guide us in such a search?

We see him in physical form as a large man. Bearded for your time. He will understand the information given. He will make himself known to you. INT: Has he already made himself kno wn? VOICE: This is a possibility since we cannot perceive time. INT: Understood. The Association... the Research Association... is almost formed..... [January 1985] VOICE: The Society of the Minds of One? INT: The Association that has been form ed to bring together the \"Minds of One\" for a common purpose. It is \"The Anna Mitchell - Hedges Research and Exploration Association\". Do you have any input or comments at this time? VOICE: We would advise you that the Minds of One will dwindle in number until you have the purification. There will be many who will be drawn... those \"reaching out\", and those of the Minds of One who are safe and secure and compatible at the beginning stages of your \"present\". You must be aware that many will be called but, a s it is said in your books, few will be chosen. INT: I began this saga with a \"search\" for the true beginnings of \"Man\" and you, in part, have given answers to many of my questions. As a result, I am beginning to formulate a hypothesis of just how human life may have begun here on Earth as two forms of \"man\". I wish to continue my research for the physical evidence of those first moments of existence, in material form, of \"man\" on this planet. Can you help me?

We will give you geographical locations but, of course, you must understand that these will not be easy to uncover for we have deliberately kept them hidden."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 107 INT: Why? VOICE: There are those who would u se this information to control rather than release minds. It is said, that if you realize your full potential you would then be an uncontrollable society let loose in the Universe. We seek, therefore, to refine those upon the Earth at this time until you h ave reached a point where you can accept, rather than distrust and mistrust, all that you find. It was easier for those [refined minds] - and it was easier for those not refined - to think that their life's beginnings were from animal and ape life. It was easier for their understanding, for their refinement could not handle the thought that they were, indeed, not peculiar to this planet, but that they came here as \"missionaries\". If they accepted that, then they would have to realize that there must be other life forms, and rather than seek them for harmonious purposes, they would seek to override; to conquer, to rule, and to destroy. This we could not allow. Even now we have allowed to be uncovered beginnings of civilizations far beyond those or iginally thought to exist. Very small finds are being made at this time but soon a large discovery will be made by you and your followers. But we warn you that the discovery will be such that it will be beyond your expectations and the frustration of your mind will be great indeed. INT: Thank you for that information. You have indicated this in the past. [Pause] In what part of the body resides the Soul? VOICE: Again, we ask you to focus your mind on your question. Why thickest thou that a Soul must b e of the Third Dimension? INT: Well put! Is the 'mind' also the Soul? VOICE: The mind is the vehicle of the Soul. The Soul is the Spiritual Essence, the very seed, the very pinpoint of light reflection that is, as you perceive, \"God\"."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 108 INT: We want to finish these sessions now and end this book.

We offer you now a Third Dimensional demonstration of the knowledge you have rele ased so far. You have touched but this amount... [Carole demonstrates by touching the tip of her fingernail to part of one of the Crystal Skull's teeth] INT: I understand. It is just that this is the first book that is going out to the world. We want t he end to be the beginning of the next book. VOICE: Let us end - again we use a \"time\" oriented word meaning \"beginning\" and \"ending\". But there is not birth [and] there is no death. Instead, we would offer you this thought: If the mind of each indiv idual has the power of creation, then let us create harmony and compatibility. Let us create a world where all may have an opinion and not be crucified for his differences. Let us strive to bring our world back into focus. Let us strive to cast out all neg ativity so that this small planet will not be known as the Small Dark Planet of Earth but, rather, let us refine it. And now, let us reach into the \"time\" and \"space\" theories and understand that they are there to cloak the eyes. Let us reach out with our minds and understand that this small Earth could, indeed, be the one linking point for many galaxies. Let us open the minds of those of One to understand that, with concentration of the mind, we can control and create an environment in which all of those o f the like minds will be compatible [and able] to co - exist and learn in the Third Dimension, [and] that there is a possibility to create life and form of such depth that has never been understood before. Let us know that that which you think to be of m ystery and mysticism is merely that which is not understood at this time, and that the understanding of the world of science is but a deliberate and understood form of darkness... a cloaking the mind so that those of the Gross Being may still control and k eep this Earth in its small dark form.

Whether by coincidence or not, the weather patterns have altered drastically all over the world since this session was given. Much of this can be blamed on atmospher ic pollution - man - made as well as that caused by ash from volcanic eruptions in Mexico, Mount St. Helens, and Hawaii - with the resultant \"Greenhouse Effect\". Record high and low temperatures have been registered, while major floods have caused havoc in many parts of the world. Drought has affected many parts of the globe, and memories of the terrible devastation and human suffering it caused in Ethiopia leaving behind those tragic pictures of starving men, woman and children indelibly printed in our mind s. More recently, the effects of El Nino during the 1990's into the new millennium have altered the weather patterns all over the globe. Appendix #2. Many new finds have been made during the past eighteen years through the use of remote sensing devices aboard satellites and space shuttle craft. The Columbia, on its second mission, used a device to penetrate the subsurface of the Sahara Desert to reveal what had been - thousands of years ago - lush river valleys southwest of Egypt plus data which led to t he discovery of a 20,000 year old settlement beneath the desert surface that had once been surrounded by unknown water systems as large as the Nile. In addition, there have also been many new discoveries made in Central and South America including one of s everal organized human civilizations, plus that of a 6,000 year old wooden well structure lying on the floor of the Mediterranean off the coast of Israel; A 9,000 year old Village unearthed in Jordan and the skull of a Neanderthal man were found in Egypt t hat is estimated to be 80,000 years old. In the Americas, far - reaching finds have uncovered in Florida a 7,000 year old skull with a preserved brain intact, plus a vast network of ancient ruins, mounds, walls and huge “geo - glyphs” (similar to those in the Nasca Plains in Peru) stretching from Needles in California down the banks of the Colorado River to Yuma, Arizona. In addition, remains of a 10,000 to 12,000 year old primitive society have been uncovered in British Columbia; also a 13,000 year old set of ruins in Chile, plus innumerable ruins of enormous citadels and pyramids been discovered using a new remote - sensing device and photographic analysis on satellite pictures (see January, 1985 edition of OMNI).

For scholars and others interested in early American discoveries, we strongly recommend three excellent books by Dr. Barry Fell; \"Saga America\", \"Bronze Age America\", and \"America B.C.\" Appendix #3. The ANNA MITCHELL -HEDGES RESEARCH AND EXPLOR - ATION ASSOCIATI ON was originally formed to undertake (a) The future housing of the Crystal Skull. (b) Exploration and research into the origin of the Crystal Skull and (c) Scientific research into all paranormal aspects of the Skull including the use of crystals in heali ng.

It should be remembered that VOICE will often say “You...” meaning members of the population in general. To our knowledge - as of date of this publica tion (June, 2001) - there have been a number of searches under - taken in this area. To those readers hooked to the net, a simple search will uncover a wealth of material on the subject of Atlantis, with Bimini featuring quite prominently in it. “Back to Bi mini”, by William Donato, gives a relatively up to date read on recent explorations in the area. Appendix #5. There have been many polar reversals during the history of our planet Earth, and there is a wealth of scientific evidence to substantiate the reversal theory. As recently as the day of this session, March 18th, 1984, a report out of California suggested that the Earth may be due for yet another polar reversal. It was this report that was being referred to at the time. There have been many excell ent books written on the subject of Earth Changes - both before and since this statement was made - adding even more weight to this prophesy. For further reading by anyone interested in the subject, we strongly recommend reading just a few of the many book s written on the subject of Edgar Cayce and his remarkable prophesies. Also, “We Are The Earthquake Generation” by Dr Jeffrey Goodman: “Earth Changes Ahead” by Frank Don: “The Age of Cataclysm” by Alfred L. Webre and Phillip H. Liss, as well as, “ Beyond The Veil of Time...” by the authors of this book."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 Appendix #6. This prediction was later proven to be 100% accurate. While in London to attend the re - opening of the refurbished Old Vic Theatre later that year, I accidently stumbled across a ‘New Age - Type ’ book store down a back alley, and enquired about the “Green Stone”. The clerk was not familiar with it, but another customer overheard my query and directed me to a store in another part of London where I found a copy of a book entitled, “The Green Stone ”, written by Graham Phillips and Martin Keatman [ISBN: 0 - 85978 - 060 - 0]. It would appear that the ‘Green Stone’ itself is [like the Mitchell - Hedges Crystal Skull] also a \"Receptacle of Mind”. Appendix #7. Long before hearing of a theory [expounded by F rench chemist, Joseph Davidovits] that claimed the great stones of the Egyptian pyramids had not been hewn from solid rock but, instead, had been ‘cast’ in place in forms in much the same way concrete is ‘cast’ in place today, it had been our opinion that many of the ancient walls - especially the Inca structures - had been formed that way. Many Mayan and Inca pyramids - and also their walls - are made in the form of geometric cuts - a form of \"Jigsaw puzzle\" - in which the \"stones\" are pre - shaped to interl ock with each other. It was illogical to believe that any stonemason capable of cutting a block of granite into such intricate shapes would not also be capable of shaping each block in a uniform - and far more simple - cube or other regular square - sided sh ape. That is, unless they were deliberately using the intricate patterning as a form of communication. To us, this theory is amply demonstrated by the ancient walls at Cusco, Peru, where many of the \"blocks\" have formed a somewhat soft marshmallow - look as if they had been cast in place - in mold forms - and the molds had been removed just before the mortar - mix had fully set. If this process is duplicated in molds or forms using wet clay or concrete, the same results will ensue once the molds or forms a re removed. If, as we believe, this is a deliberate form of communication, then it is our hope that someone knowledgeable in epigraphy - or the ciphering ancient languages - will, someday, fully research this subject.

Wagner: Insanity - died in his 50s. Schuman: Suicide at 35. Schubert: Consumption at 35. The more recent tragic death s of many of the contemporary pop musicians and composers have been well documented. Appendix #10. Although there have been several articles written referring to “Twin Moons” and “Twin Planets”, I had not been able to uncover any scientific support that such a phenomenon exists. Unable to confirm any solid evidence of other planets in our Solar system I had reluctantly dismissed the claim. However, vindication was at hand for our informant when on July 3 rd , 2001 , a news item appeared on BBC News Online claiming a “Giant world had been detected in deep space.” This ‘world’ (or planet - like - object) was first discovered by a team of scientists led by Lawrence Wasserman at Lowell Observatory. Dubbed 2001 KX76, it lies in the KUIPER BELT, a region lying just beyond the orbit of Pluto and its moon, Charon. Astronomers now believe there is possibility that other planet - size objects will be discovered in the same area. Appendix #11. A wealth of material has appeared in the Press over the years since this inter view, concerning the multiple use of sound in the practice of modern medicine. Although not new, there have been vast strides in the use of ultra - sonic sound waves to remove kidney stones by ultrasonic disintegration, plus the use of ultra - sound to stimula te the heart muscles. Also, there is a relatively recent discovery that claims a small number people suffer from a disorder termed \"musicogenic epilepsy\" - a condition which causes seizures to occur whenever the subjects hear certain melodies - with Rock m usic having been specifically cited as triggering seizures under test conditions. We are most interested in pursuing this aspect of research and welcome all available information in this area. The healing properties of Light and Sound have only recently be en scratched and we are anxious to pursue avenues where \"Music\" in its broadest sense (i.e. chords, harmonics, melody, instrumental, vocal, mantras, etc.) can be used as a viable adjunct to the overall healing process.

His remark able singing voice has elicited worldwide response from listeners who claim to have been healed, in a variety of ways, just by listening to his records.

The date 2005 is again repeated in “ Beyond the Veil of Time...” as being the beginning of the events heralding the “Earth Changes” that will mark the end of the world as we know it. It also gives the reader an insight as to what will happen to our planet whe n a magnetic pole reversal takes place and the magnetic shield is momentarily “turned off” leaving the Earth”s surface vulnerable to solar and cosmic rays. It is believed that this is to be the “Fire from the Heavens” prophesied in the Bible as being the n ext cataclysmic event - after he Great Flood - to strike the planet. Appendix #14. All of the predictions on this page have proven to be 100% accurate: In addition to the discovery of the New Planet in the KUIPER BELT, VOICE’s warning that ‘brother will kill brother’ has manifested itself in multiple school and juvenile gang killings in a number of different locations in North America and elsewhere in the world. He also states that, “In the coming years you will experience much pestilence in that which f lies (birds , bats, mosquitoes, etc) upon your planet.” This too has begun to show itsd face in N. America where only recently the West Nile virus - primarily carried by birds of the crow family and passed on to humans through a bite by a mosquito - has al ready claimed lives in New York and other eastern states. As of the time of updating this book (late summer 2001) a number of dead crows and blue jays carrying the disease have already been found across the border in Southern Ontario, Canada.

In recent times, devastating winds reminiscent of the Dust Storms of the 1920's and ‘30's, have swept across the mid - western United States and Canada since the turn of the new century. To cap this, in the early months of 2000, ‘Foot and Mouth’ disease became an epidemic that was to spread rapidly throughout all continents with the exception of Austr alia and North America. This has resulted in the culling of millions of head of livestock (cattle, swine, goats, sheep and other cloven - hoofed animals) throughout the infected areas of the world.
