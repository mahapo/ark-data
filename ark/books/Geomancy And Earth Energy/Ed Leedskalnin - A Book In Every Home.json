Now, I will tell you why I did not get the girl. In Ed's Place, there was a lasting fame for a girl's name but it would have taken money to put the fame upon her. The trouble was that I did not have the money and didn't make enough. That was the reason I could not look for a girl. Now, I am going to tell you what I mean when I say \"Ed's Sweet Sixteen\". I don't mean a sixteen year old girl, I mean a brand new one. If it had meant a sixteen year old girl, it would have meant at the same time, that I made money for the sweet sixteen while she was making love with a fresh boy. I will furnish all the love making to my girl. She will never have to seek any from anybody else, for I believe that there is not a boy or man in this world good enough to be around my girl and I believe that the other men also ought to have enough self-respect so that they would think that I am not good enough to be around theirs. Anything that we do leaves its effect, but it leaves more effect upon a girl than it does upon a boy or a man, because the girl's body, mind and all her constitution is more tender and so it leaves more impressions - and why should one want to be around anybody's else impressions? A girl is to a fellow the best thing in this world, but to have the best one second hand, it is humiliating. All girls below sixteen should be brand new. If a girl below sixteen cannot be called brand new any more, it is not the girl's fault; the mamma is to blame! It is the mamma's duty to supervise the girl to keep those fresh boys away. In case the girl's mamma thinks that there is a boy somewhere who needs experience, then she, herself, could pose as an experimental station for that fresh boy to practice on and so save the girl. Nothing can hurt her any more. She has"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"already gone through all the experience that can be gone through and so in her case, it would be all right. But all the blame does not rest on the mamma alone. The schools and the churches are cheapening the girls! They are arranging picnics - are coupling up the girls with the fresh boys - and then they send them out to the woods, parks, beaches and other places so that they can practice in first degree love making. Now, I will tell you what the first degree love making is. The first degree love making is when the fresh boy begins to soil the girl by patting, rubbing and squeezing her. They start it in that way but soon it begins to get dull and there is no kick in it, so they have to start in on the second degree and keep on and then by and by, when the right man comes along and when he touches the girl, then he touches her like dead flesh. There is no more response in it because all the response has been worked out with those fresh boys. Why should it be that way? Everything we do should be for some good purpose but as everybody knows there is nothing good that can come to a girl from a fresh boy. When a girl is sixteen or seventeen years old, she is as good as she ever will be, but when a boy is sixteen years old, he is then fresher than in all his stages of development. He is then not big enough to work but he is too big to be kept in a nursery and then to allow such a fresh thing to soil a girl - it could not work on my girl. Now I will tell you about soiling. Anything that is done, if it is with the right party it is all right, but when it is with the wrong party, it is soiling, and concerning those fresh boys with the girls, it is wrong every time. Now, how can you find out if I am right? Pick out any girl you want but do it before she has anything to do with anybody - as soon as she begins to couple herself with somebody. You watch her every day and some day you will see the girl coming home with a red face. One's face is a window for other people to look in on and when it turns red it shows that there was something done that her moral conscience told her should not have been done. It is shocking to imagine that someone else produced that red face to my girl. In such a case she could not be one hundred per cent sweet. As soon as a girl acquires experience the sweetness begins to leave her right away. The first experience in everything is the most impressive. It"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"should be reserved for the permanent partner - the less of the new experience is left, the cheaper the affair will be. That is the reason why I want a girl the way Mother nature puts her out. This means before anybody has had any chance to be around her and before she begins to misrepresent herself. I want to pick out the girl while she is guided by the instinct alone. When I started out in doing things that would make it possible for me to get a girl, I set a rule in my behavior to follow: The sweet sixteen had to be a beginner and a likable girl and with a mild disposition; I had to be deserving of her. Everybody's sweet sixteen should be so high in one's estimation that no temptation could induce one to act behind her back. I always have wanted a girl but I never had one. The reason why is that I knew it would produce several conditions and leave their effects, but I did not want any effects from past experience left on me and my sweet sixteen. A girl will economize, go hungry and endure other hardships before she will put on another girl's dress to wear. I will put gunny sacks on before I will wear another man's clothes, and this is only a step from having another fellow's girl or another girl's fellow. Having such a case the present possessor would have to clean up the past performer's effects. Now you see, to clean up the other person's leavings, it is humiliating, so it would be a cheap and undesirable affair. I want one hundred per cent good or none. That is why I was so successful in resisting the natural urge for love making. Now about sweet and how sweet, a girl can be one hundred per cent sweet to one only and no more. To illustrate, suppose we are two men and a girl together somewhere and some one else would ask if she is sweet and we both would say she is sweet. But let her act very friendly with the other fellow and then if someone should ask if she is sweet, I would say that she is not. Now you see her friendly action with the other fellow produced a change in me and it would produce a change in any other normal man."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"We always strive for perfection. We are only one-half of a perfect whole, man is the bigger and stronger half and the woman is the other. To be perfect there must be two, but where there is two there is no room for more, so the third party is left to go somewhere else with sour feelings. A normal male is always ready to strive for perfection, the female is not. It is not only with human beings, it is the same with every living thing. If you watch a flock of chickens, where there is a rooster, and if you add another rooster, you will see them fight to death. One will have to go or be killed and this is the same thing with the other living things. Lower forms of life are guided by instincts alone so the present only comes into consideration. As soon as the other male is chased away, the female is as good as she ever was, but with us it is different. We are guided more by reason and thought than by instinct and so the present, past and future come into consideration. Now, if it is not good today, it was not good yesterday and it won't be good tomorrow. That is why an experienced girl cannot be one hundred per cent sweet. According to my observation the girls are wrong in looking for their permanent partners. They are too quick. By being too quick, they only get those fellows with quick emotions. All quick emotions are irresponsible and short lasting. There are two kinds of love - sensual and sentimental. Sensual love has the present and little future only. The sentimental love has the present, past and future, so it is more desirable. It will be slower but it will last longer. Now, girls, when any fellow jumps quickly at you, you had better keep away from him. He has no consideration that the action would do any good to you. You are the weakest side, so you should have the better deal and if you don't get the better deal, there is a little brute in him and it may come very hard to train it out of him. The fellow who makes an advance toward you, and if he won't state what the eventual purpose will be, he is not a gentleman. All men should know that the girl's primary purpose is to find a permanent partner while they are young. Those fellows who fail to see this are not desirable to have around. Girls below sixteen should not be allowed to associate with the boys, they are practicing in love making, such a thing should be discouraged. Love making"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"should be reserved for their permanent partners. With every love making affair, their hearts get bruised and by the time they grow up, their hearts are so badly bruised that they are no more good. Boys and girls start out as friends and finish as disappointed lovers, now let me tell you. Male and female are never friends, a friend will not want anything from a friend, but a boy or a girl, one or the other, sooner or later, will ask for a little kiss, so they are not friends, they are lovers. Let's see what happens when they are selecting their partners while they are young. They select their partners on account of good looks. The liking for the good looks remain but the good looks change and they change so much in ten years that you would not recognize them if you had not seen them now and then - and the boy gets the best deal almost every time. By that time they are grown up. The girls will be faded so much that the fellow would not want her any more so then, any girl who associates with a fellow only five years older is headed for a bad disappointment. This all could be avoided with the right kind of an education. Now, a few words about education. You know we receive an education in the schools from books. All those books that people became educated from twenty-five years ago, are wrong now, and those that are good now, will be wrong again twenty-five years from now. So if they are wrong then, they are also wrong now, and the one who is educated from the wrong books is not educated, he is misled. All books that are written are wrong, the one who is not educated cannot write a book and the one who is educated, is not really educated but he is misled and the one who is misled cannot write a book which is correct. The misleading began when our far distant ancestors began to teach their descendants. You know they knew nothing but they passed their knowledge of nothing to the coming generations and it went so innocently that nobody noticed it. That is why we are not educated. Now I will tell you what education is according to my reasoning. An educated person is one whose senses are refined. We are born as brutes, we remain and die as the same if we do not become polished. Some are too coarse to take it. The main base of education is one's \"self-respect\". Any one lacking self-respect cannot be educated. The main bases of self-respect is the willingness to learn, to do only the things that are good and right, to believe only in the things that can be proved, to possess appreciation and self control."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Now, if you lack willingness to learn, you will remain as a brute and if you do things that are not good and right, you will be a low person, and if you believe in things that cannot be proved, any feeble minded person can lead you, and if you lack appreciation, it takes away the incentive for good doing and if you lack self control you will never know the limit. So all those lacking these characteristics in their makeup are not educated."}]
