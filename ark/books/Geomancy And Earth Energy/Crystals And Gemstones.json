CRYSTAL AND GEMSTONE POWER Why do Crystals & Gemstones have power? There are many theories but one of the most popular is that all crystals have"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"the capacity to absorb energies, emotions & knowledge. The variety in their composition means that each type absorbs different powers & these powers are then naturally imparted to the user or wearer. How do you use Crystals & Gemstones? Firstly it is very important to cleanse your newly acquired crystal or gemstone even if you found it. This is basically to remove any influences from anyone else who has handled the stone. There is no right or wrong way to cleanse your stone & its best to experiment with different methods until you find one that is right for you. To cleanse your stones wash each stone separately. If you plan to leave them to soak then use a separate container of water for each stone & please be sure to use clean water for each stone. This may seem obvious to some but you ' d be surprised how many people acquire several stones at once & just put them all to soak together in a single container. It ' s also important to use a natural container not one made of plastic! You may then wish to recharge your stone and this involves using the power of the earth, sun & moon. I rinse my stones under running tap water then bury them in some earth, (a plant pot will do) for at least a day, so that they may receive earth energies. I then soak them overnight in tap water with a sprinkle of sea salt followed by placing them outside in sunlight so that they may get re-charged or re-energised by the sun. EVERY full moon I place my stones outside so that they may also receive energy from the moon. Obviously, if I ' ve acquired a new stone & the next full moon is a long way off, they don ' t get placed outside for moon energies immediately. It is then important to personalise your stone & get to know it. Take the time to hold each stone and feel it with your hands"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"so that you may become attuned with it. Should you share your Crystals & Gemstones? Many people do not allow anyone else to touch or handle their stones and I too have some some \" special \" stones that only I touch. However, I have a large wooden bowl on my coffee table and it always attracts attention from visitors who are often drawn to picking up a stone and rolling it in their hand, like a stress ball. I don ' t have a problem with this as I like to think that they may \" need \" something form whatever stone they ' ve chosen. Should you share your Crystals & Gemstones? Many people do not allow anyone else to touch or handle their stones and I too have some \" special \" stones that only I touch. However, I have a large wooden bowl on my coffee table and it always attracts attention from visitors who are often drawn to picking up a stone and rolling it in their hand, like a stress ball. I don ' t have a problem with this as I like to think that they may \" need \" something form whatever stone they ' ve subconsciously chosen. My children are also constantly \" playing \" with my stones and sometimes ask to take a certain stone to bed with them. This is why I periodically repeat the cleansing process and recharge my stones. Having said that, it is important that you treat your stones with respect, care and consideration. Tumblestones and smaller pieces are great for carrying with you each day or make excellent gifts for friends and loved ones. I have a selection of stones that I change and carry according to my feelings or requirements on a particular day. I also have several pieces of jewellery containing different stones and again change these to suit my needs. For example I may wear a particular stone, or have one close by, whilst writing my E-Books but if I ' m planning a romantic evening with my husband then I ' ll be sure to change the stones later in"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"the evening. There are numerous ways to use your stones - You can place them under your pillow or on a bedside cabinet so you can absorb their influences whilst you sleep. If you have an ailing plant place some crystals around it or soak a stone in water overnight and use it to water the plant the following day. Talk to your stones, carry them with you, get to know them and feel their energies working for you and then use them however you feel is most appropriate. Crystal Wands can be used to recharge your whole body. Hold one in your transmitting hand (left if you ' re left handed or right if you ' re right handed) with the point pointing towards your fingers. Take the second wand and hold it in your receiving hand with the point facing towards your wrist. You now have a complete circuit and after a short while you should feel a flow of energy passing through your body. You can also use a pair of male & female stones in the same way. Healing with stones is something that ' s been going on for centuries although there is now an increasing interest in Crystal healing. Most healers have their own methods and techniques, which they have developed over a period of time to suit them. I stress again, there is no right or wrong way to use crystals and over time you will develop your own rituals for cleansing and using your crystals. I also stress again that crystal & gemstone healing cannot"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"replace medical treatment and you should always consult a doctor. Crystal & gemstone treatment is a complimentary therapy and should be used as such - complimentary to any other medical treatment you may require. Diagnosis can be achieved by holding a wand or point in your receiving hand and moving it slowly over the body. With time you will learn to sense an area that needs healing. There is no need to remove your clothes and most healers will not ask you to remove them. If a healer does ask you to remove your clothes then please bear in mind whether you are comfortable with this as it is in no way necessary but some prefer it. Treatments are numerous and again vary from healer to healer. Some will choose a set of crystals for you to carry with you day & night, others may use a wand or point. In this case the wand is held lightly, as for diagnosing, but usually in the transmitting hand and pointing towards the area to be healed. However, if something needs to be \" brought out \" from the area the wand will be held pointing away. Another, fairly common, method is to surround the affected area with appropriate crystals. If the crystals are pointed they will generally be placed with the point towards the area requiring healing for at least 10 minutes. Chakra healing is also a method used by some healers. Choosing your Crystal or Gemstone - Actually, they ' ll probably choose you. They pop into your life in mysterious & magical ways. They ' ll \" speak \" to you and sparkle like crazy. Crystals respond to thought & feelings so take your time in looking at them and just see if any \" jump out \" at you."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Just look, don ' t touch and see if you ' re repeatedly drawn back to looking at the same one. Try not to let logic decide for you - biggest isn ' t always best! Let your intuition guide you & trust that feeling. What about the facets? Well 1 is the number of beginning, initiating, inspiration, ideas & confidence so a Cabochon would be ideal. 2 symbolises mothering & caring. 2 crystals joined represent partnership & sharing. 3 is for communication, expression & creativity. The holy trinity. 4 = mind, body, spirit & feeling. 5 is for freedom & curiosity. 6 = balance & harmony. 7 is for the mystic and seeker of truth. 8 = Power 9 is for helping to learn the lessons of life. 10 represents the whole - it contains the 1 of I am and the circle of completion. 11 A master number that emphasises the meaning of two 1s but also 1+1=2 which symbolises an ability to care for others. 12 completes a cycle - 12 signs of the zodiac, 12 hours of day and night."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"13 is the number of divination. Crystals will create harmony wherever they are. For instance, if you have a child that can ' t sleep at night or wakes from nightmares then try placing a crystal under their bed. Children are very receptive to crystals and their power and mine often pick one up and rub it over their tummy or head if hurting - they even instinctively use a clockwise movement. If someone is sick try placing a crystal in the room with them. Try placing crystals around your garden plants or in potted plants & see how much more beautiful & bright they bloom & grow. To specifically energise a garden try placing a crystal in each corner and another in the centre. This creates a type of energy similar to pyramid energy. After you ' ve recharged your crystal in water try pouring it over your houseplants or even give it to your pets to drink. Try putting a bowl of uncharged water out for your dog and one that is charged - after time the dog will \" choose \" to drink the charged water. To meditate with crystals try holding it in your left hand. Each time you use the crystal it will store the information form the previous meditations and will help your mind more quickly achieve the meditative state. Crystals are tools to work with & help to create a harmonious environment but they can only assist and amplify what we can do with our minds, energies & willpower. Crystals are an integral part of the Earth & the Earth and its inhabitants are crying out for love & attention. I believe the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"heart Chakra of the Earth is now opening and it is time to listen with our hearts rather than our heads. A time to trust and understand our feelings and intuition rather than logic. Crystals can help us reach this new point of balance. They are here to wake us up & remind us of whom we really are.

Many have been found in ancient ruins & Pharaoh Tombs & it is said that the lost city of Atlantis used crystal power the same way we use electricity today. Hindu Puranas describe Krishna as living in a city furnished with rubies, emeralds, sapphires & diamonds. Many cultures believed that stones had a life giving force & this eventually led to them being used for healing. Stones have also played a key roll in various religions. Islam"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"says that the stones spoke to Mohammed and informed him that he was to receive the Quran from Allah. One of the five pillars of Islam says that every Muslim should try to visit Mecca and the Kaaba which is a huge black stone. Moses received the Ten Commandments on tablets of stone which are believed to have been sapphires. In the book of Revelations describes Jerusalem as \" the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth an emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eight beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh a jacynth and the twelfth an emethyst. \" The Egyptians engraved an eye on lapis lazuli as it symbolised Ra, the Sun God. The Babylonians & Norseman engraved magical symbols on to stones & used them as Rune oracles - something which is still used today as a means of divination.
